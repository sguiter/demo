A Ordinary Shares, par value per share (the Class A Ordinary Shares included in the Units being offered, the Public
Shares at per Unit. On November 12, 2021, the Company closed on the full over-allotment, resulting in the sale of an additional
 Units. The IPO and subsequent exercise of the over-allotment generated gross proceeds of , which is described in
Note 3. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A Ordinary Shares and three-quarters of one redeemable warrant Public Warrant ). 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the sale of private placement warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement (the Private Placement to Finnovate Sponsor,
LP (the Sponsor as well as to EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. EarlyBirdCapital ). On November 12, 2021, pursuant
to the full exercise of the over-allotment option, the Sponsor purchased an additional Private Placement Warrants. The IPO and
subsequent exercise of the over-allotment generated gross proceeds of from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants. 

Following

the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account Trust
Account ), located in the United States at a nationally recognized financial institution, with Continental Stock Transfer 
Trust Company Continental acting as trustee, and invested only in in United States government securities 
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act having
a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company
Act which invest only in direct U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement,
the trustee will not be permitted to invest in other securities or assets. The Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds
pending the earliest to occur of either: (i) the completion of the Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any Public Shares properly
tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the Amended
and Restated Memorandum to (A) modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection
with the Business Combination or to redeem the Public Shares if the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within
the Combination Period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-Business Combination
activity and (iii) the redemption of all of the Public Shares if the Company is unable to complete the Business Combination by May 8,
2025, subject to applicable law. If the Company does not invest the proceeds as discussed above, the Company may be deemed to be subject
to the Investment Company Act. 

Initial
Business Combination 

The
Company s executive officers and directors Management or Management Team has broad discretion with
respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially
all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the
Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete a Business Combination with one or more
operating businesses or assets that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least of the net assets held in the
Trust Account as defined below (excluding the underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at
the time of the Company s signing of a definitive agreement in connection with its Business Combination. The Company will only
complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of
the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target business or assets sufficient for it not to be required to register as an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

The
Company will provide its holders of its Public Shares, including the holders of its Founder Shares (as defined below) prior to the Initial
Public Offering (the Initial Shareholders and Management Team to the extent its Initial Shareholders and/or the members
of the Management Team purchase Public Shares, provided that each Initial Shareholder s and member of its Management Team s
status as a Public Shareholder will only exist with respect to such Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of the Business Combination at a per-share
price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to
the consummation of the Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released
to the Company to pay taxes (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public
Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. 

The
amount in the Trust Account is approximately per Public Share as of September 30, 2024. The per-share amount the Company will
distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the underwriting commissions the Company will pay to
the underwriter. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly
redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of the Business Combination with respect to the warrants. The
Company s initial shareholders, directors and officers have entered into a letter agreement with the Company, pursuant to which
they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to the shares of Class B ordinary shares, par value 
per share Class B Ordinary Shares purchased in March 2021 (the Founder Shares, described in more detail
in Note 5) and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of the Business Combination. 

The
Company will only proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least either prior to or
upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted
in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rules and the Company
does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum,
conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file
tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction
is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons,
the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the
tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote
its Founder Shares, and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO, in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally,
each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction
or do not vote at all. 

Notwithstanding
the above, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender
offer rules, the Amended and Restated Memorandum provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder
or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more
than an aggregate of or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The
Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with
the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum (i) to modify the
substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company s Business Combination
or to redeem 100 of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision
relating to shareholders rights or pre-Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity
to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 

The
Company has until May 8, 2025 to complete a Business Combination (the Combination Period ), unless being extended by
the Company s shareholder approval. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period,
the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more
than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount
then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to
the Company to pay its tax obligations (less up to 
of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely
extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if
any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s
remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors Board or Board of Directors ),
dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of
creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect
to the Company s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the
Combination Period. 

The
Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination
within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the IPO, such Public Shares will be entitled
to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.
The underwriter has agreed to waive its right to its underwriting commission (see Note 8) held in the Trust Account in the event the
Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with
the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution,
it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the IPO price per Unit ). 

In
order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims
by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed
entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) per Public Share or (2) such
lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in
the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay franchise and income taxes. This liability
will not apply with respect to claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account
and except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriter of the IPO against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed
waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such
third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to
claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent registered public accounting
firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving
any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of . The Company s
liquidity needs up to September 30, 2024 had been satisfied by payment from the Sponsor for the Founder Shares, a loan under an unsecured
promissory note from the Sponsor of up to (the March 2021 Promissory Note ), drawdowns against the available Working
Capital Loan as defined below), as well as advances and payments made on behalf of the Company by related parties. The March 2021 Promissory
Note was fully repaid as of November 8, 2021. 

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of
the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company with funds as may be required (the Working
Capital Loan , as described in more detail in Note 5). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had thing
outstanding under the Working Capital Loan, respectively. 

On
June 2, 2023, the Company issued a promissory note (the June 2023 Promissory Note in the aggregate principal amount of
up to to the Sponsor, the proceeds from which had been deposited into the Trust Account for the benefit of each Public Share
that was not redeemed in connection with the Company s extension from May 8, 2023 to May 8, 2024 (the 2023 Extension ). The Sponsor agreed to pay per month until
the completion of an initial Business Combination, commencing on May 8, 2023 and continuing through May 8, 2024. The June 2023 Promissory
Note bears no interest and is due and payable upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which the Company consummates its Business
Combination and (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective. At the election of the Sponsor, up to of the
unpaid principal amount of the June 2023 Promissory Note may be converted into warrants of the Company (the Conversion Warrants at a conversion price of per warrant. The Conversion Warrants shall be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued by the
Company at the IPO. The Company has determined that the fair value of the June 2023 Promissory Note is its face value as the note was
not issued with a substantial premium. The Sponsor funded the first three months of the June 2023 Promissory Note in its first payment.
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of the June 30, 2023 Promissory Note was and ,
respectively, which is included in the Promissory Note payable related party account on the accompanying condensed balance sheets,
and no interest was accrued. 

If
the Company is not able to consummate a Business Combination before May 8, 2025, the Company will commence an automatic winding
up, dissolution and liquidation. Management has determined that automatic liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential
subsequent dissolution also raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. While Management
intends to complete a Business Combination on or before May 8, 2025, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to do
so. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after
May 8, 2025.

Risks
and Uncertainties 

Our
results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could
cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted
by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in
interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,
including resurgences and the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and
the Middle East. We cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude
or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination. 

Management
is currently evaluating the impact of such risks and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that they could have a negative
effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations, close of the IPO and/or search for a target company, the
specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements. The accompanying
unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Making
estimates requires Management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of
a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements,
which Management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly,
the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

and , respectively. The Company s portfolio of investments is comprised of cash in an interest-bearing demand deposit
account and thus have a readily determinable fair value. The funds are presented on the accompanying condensed balance sheets at fair
value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities is included in
 income on investments held in the Trust Account in the accompanying unaudited condensed statements of operations. The estimated
fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information.

losses on this account, and Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.

The
fair value of the Company s financial assets and liabilities reflects Management s estimate of amounts that the Company would
have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company
seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable
inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is
used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and
liabilities: 

Level
 1 
 Valuations
 based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.
 Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not being applied. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and
 regularly available in an active market, valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment. 

Level
 2 
 Valuations
 based on (i) quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, (ii) quoted prices in markets that are not active
 for identical or similar assets, (iii) inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities, or (iv) inputs that are derived
 principally from or corroborated by market through correlation or other means. 

Level
 3 
 Valuations
 based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.

number of shares of Class B Ordinary Shares (the Sponsor Conversion ). Combined with the conversion of Director Shares discussed below, the Sponsor Conversion left one

Founder Shares 

In
March 2021, the Company issued to EarlyBirdCapital and its designees an aggregate of Class A Ordinary Shares EBC Founder
Shares at a price of per share. The Company estimated the fair value of the EBC Founder Shares to be based upon

assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a period of 180 days immediately following the effective date of the registration statements related
to the IPO except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in the IPO and their officers or partners, associated persons
or affiliates.

Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

All
statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September
30, 2024 (this Report including, without limitation, statements under this Item regarding our financial position, business
strategy and the plans and objectives of Management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used in this Report,
words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend and
similar expressions, as they relate to us or our Management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are
based on the beliefs of our Management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our Management. Actual
results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in
our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf
are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited
condensed financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements. 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 15, 2021 and formed for the purpose of entering into a Business
Combination with one or more businesses. 

We
consummated our Initial Public Offering on November 8, 2021 and are currently in the process of consummating the Scage Business Combination. 

The
issuance of additional shares in an initial Business Combination: 

may
 significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in the Initial Public Offering, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution
 provisions in our Class B Ordinary Shares resulted in the issuance of our Class A Ordinary Shares on a greater than one-to-one basis
 upon conversion of our Class B Ordinary Shares; 

may
 subordinate the rights of holders of our Class A Ordinary Shares if shares of preferred shares are issued with rights senior to those
 afforded our Class A Ordinary Shares; 

could
 cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our Class A Ordinary Shares are issued, which may affect, among other
 things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present
 officers and directors; 

may
 have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person
 seeking to obtain control of us; and 

may
 adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A Ordinary Shares and/or Warrants. 

Similarly,
if we issue debt securities, or otherwise incur significant debt, it could result in: 

default
 and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt
 obligations; 

acceleration
 of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants
 that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of such covenants; 

our
 immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand; 

25 

our
 inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing
 while the debt is outstanding; 

our
 inability to pay dividends on our ordinary or preferred shares; 

using
 a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends
 on our Ordinary Shares if declared and our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions and fund other general
 corporate purposes; 

limitations
 on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased
 vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;
 and 

limitations
 on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements and execution
 of our strategy and for other purposes, and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 

Initial
Public Offering 

We
completed the sale of 15,000,000 Units at 10.00 per Unit on November 8, 2021. Simultaneous with the closing of the Initial Public Offering,
we completed the sale of 7,900,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a Private Placement
to our Sponsor as well as to EarlyBirdCapital, generating gross proceeds of 7,900,000 from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants. 

On
November 12, 2021, we closed on the full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option, which resulted in the sale of an
additional 2,250,000 Units for additional gross proceeds to us of 22,500,000 and aggregate IPO and over-allotment gross proceeds of
 172,500,000. Simultaneously with the exercise of the over-allotment, the Sponsor purchased an additional 900,000 Private Placement Warrants,
which resulted in additional gross proceeds of 900,000 and aggregate Private Placement proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and
over-allotment of 8,800,000. 

Following
the closing of the IPO on November 8, 2021 and the subsequent exercise of the over-allotment option, 175,950,000 10.20 per Unit) from
the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in the Trust Account,
located in the United States at a nationally recognized financial institution, with Continental acting as trustee and until November
2, 2023 invested only in in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct Treasury obligations. Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the trustee will not be
permitted to invest in other securities or assets. As of November 2, 2023, the funds in the Trust Account were moved to an interest-bearing
demand deposit account. 

The
SEC has adopted new rules and regulations for special purpose acquisition companies SPACs ), which became effective on
July 1, 2024 (the 2024 SPAC Rules ). The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among other matters, (i) additional disclosures relating
to SPAC sponsors and related persons; (ii) additional disclosures relating to SPAC Business Combination transactions (iii) additional
disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest involving sponsors and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings
and Business Combination transactions; (iv) additional disclosures regarding projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed
Business Combination transactions and (v) the requirement that both the SPAC and its target company be co-registrants for Business
Combination registration statements. In addition, the SEC s adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which
a SPAC could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose,
and the activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect our ability
to complete our initial Business Combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto.

In
connection with the closing of the Sunorange Investment, on May 8, 2023, Sunorange caused 300,000 to be deposited into the Trust Account
to support the first three months of the 2023 Extension. Sunorange has agreed to deposit into the Trust Account an additional 100,000

2023
Extension of Our Combination Period 

On

holders of Class B Ordinary Shares to convert such shares into Class A Ordinary Shares prior to the closing of an initial Business Combination
at the election of the holder. 

There

Conversion Warrants at a conversion price of 1.00 per Warrant. The Conversion Warrants shall be identical to the Private Placement Warrants
issued by us at the IPO. We have determined that the fair value of the June 2023 Promissory Note is its face value as the note was not
issued with a substantial premium. The Sponsor funded the first three months of the June 2023 Promissory Note in its first payment. As

Nasdaq
Delisting 

On
May 6, 2024, we received a notice from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying us that since we were first notified on October 9, 2023, we had
not regained compliance with Minimum Public Holders Requirement by the end of the 180-day extension period ended April 8, 2024. On
May 13, 2024, we requested a hearing before the Hearing Panel to appeal the determination, and the hearing was held on June 25,
2024. 

On
July 3, 2024, we received written notice (the July 2024 Decision from Nasdaq indicating that the Hearing Panel had
granted our request for continued listing on Nasdaq, subject to us completing a Business Combination with an operating entity and
evidencing compliance with the criteria for initial listing on Nasdaq, including the applicable Minimum Public Holders Requirement,
by November 4, 2024. 

On November 8,
2024, we received written notice from the Hearing Panel indicating that the Hearing Panel had determined to delist our
securities from the Nasdaq and that trading in the Company s securities would be suspended at the open of trading on November
12, 2024 due to its failure to satisfy the terms of the Hearing Panel s July 2024 Decision. Since such time, our securities have been quoted on the OTC Markets under the tickers
 FNVUF, FNVTF, and FNVWF, respectively.

Results
of Operations 

As
of September 30, 2024, we have not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from March 15, 2021 (inception) through September
30, 2024, relates to our formation and Initial Public Offering that occurred on November 8, 2021, and, since the completion of the Initial
Public Offering, searching for a target to consummate an initial Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until
after the completion of an initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest
income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering and placed in the Trust Account. There has been no significant change
in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements,
December 31, 2023. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 97,285 consisting of 375,172 in operating, general and administrative
expenses offset by 277,887 in interest gained on the bank account and the investment held in Trust Account. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, we had net income of 95,191, consisting of 1,247,329 in interest gained on the bank account and the investment
held in Trust Account offset by 1,152,138 in operating, general and administrative expenses. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 6,069, consisting of 641,632 in interest gained on the bank account
and the investment held in Trust Account offset by 635,563 in formation, general and administrative expenses. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, we had net income of 2,412,428, consisting of 3,894,122 in interest gained on the bank account and the investment
held in Trust Account offset by 1,481,694 in formation, general and administrative expenses. 

Factors
That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations 

Our
results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could
cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted
by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in
interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, public health considerations, and geopolitical
instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. We cannot at this time predict the likelihood of one or more
of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete
an initial Business Combination. 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash outside our Trust Account of 7,555 available for working capital needs. All remaining cash was held
in the Trust Account and is generally unavailable for our use prior to our initial Business Combination. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 743,940 in operating activities, which was largely driven by 1,246,905 in interest
earned on our investments held in the Trust Account offset by 95,191 in net income and a 407,774 change in operating assets and liabilities. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we were provided 26,320,476 in our investing activities, which was driven by 26,907,976 in
shareholder redemptions offset by 587,500 in extension contributions. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 25,569,018 in our financing activities, which was the largely the result of 26,907,976
paid out in redemptions to shareholders offset by 1,338,958 in proceeds from our promissory notes. 

As
noted above, pursuant to our Initial Public Offering on November 8, 2021 and the full exercise of the over-allotment option on November
12, 2021, we sold 17,250,000 Units at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to us of 172,500,000. These funds as well
as a portion of the 8,800,000 in proceeds from the sale of Private Placement Warrants were placed in the Trust Account such that the
Trust Account held an aggregate of 175,900,000, or 10.20 per Unit, as of November 12, 2021. These funds are to be invested in U.S.
government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the
Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company. As of September 30, 2024, 26,126,773 of the Initial Public Offering proceeds as
well as interest earned thereon were held in the Trust Account. 

30 

On
November 1, 2023, we instructed Continental to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the
Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at Morgan Stanley with Continental continuing to act as trustee, until the
earlier of the consummation of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments
in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement are no longer invested in U.S. government
securities or money market funds invested in U.S. government securities. 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination,
our Initial Shareholders or their affiliates or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as
may be required. If we complete our initial Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts (subject to the conversion rights
described below). In the event that our initial Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to
 1,500,000 of such loans may at the option of the lender determined at the time of the loan be convertible into Warrants at a price of
 1.00 per Warrant of the post-initial Business Combination entity. The Warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants,
including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period of the underlying Warrants. As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Working Capital Loan. 

On
May 8, 2023, in connection with the Sunorange Investment, the Working Capital Loan and all amounts outstanding thereunder were canceled
in full. This was deemed to be a benefit to us under SAB Topic 5T. In order to recognize this benefit, we de-recognized the outstanding
promissory note and reclassified it to additional paid-in capital, as an in-substance capital contribution. 

On
November 8, 2023, we issued the November 2023 Promissory Note in the principal amount of up to 1,500,000 to Sunorange. The November
2023 Promissory Note was issued in connection with advances made by Sunorange since May 8, 2023 and advances Sunorange may make in the
future to us for working capital expenses. The November 2023 Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable upon the earlier of
(i) the date of the consummation of the Business Combination or (ii) the date of our liquidation. As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, we had 1,193,961 and 542,503, respectively, outstanding under the November 2023 Promissory Note. 

On
January 26, 2024, we issued the January 2024 Promissory Note in the aggregate principal amount of up to 1,500,000 to Scage, for the
Company s working capital needs, including but not limited to any payment obligations to support the 2023 Extension. The note does
not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of the closing of an initial Business Combination by the Company and the Company s
liquidation. As of September 30, 2024, we had 200,000 outstanding under the January 2024 Promissory Note. 

On May 15, 2024, the Company
issued an unsecured promissory note (the May 2024 Promissory Note in the aggregate principal amount of up to 225,000 to
the Sponsor, which will be deposited into the Trust Account for the benefit of each Public Share that was not redeemed in connection with
the May 8, 2024 shareholder vote to approve an extension of the Company s termination date from May 8, 2024 to November 8, 2024
(the May 2024 Extension ). The Sponsor agreed to pay 37,500 per month until the completion of an initial Business Combination,
commencing on May 8, 2024 and continuing through November 8, 2024. The May 2024 Promissory Note bears no interest and is due and payable
upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which we consummate our Business Combination and (ii) the date that our winding up is effective.
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 187,500 and 0, respectively, outstanding under the May 2024 Promissory
Note, which is included in the Promissory Note payable related party account on the accompanying condensed balance sheets. 

On
November 11, 2024, the Company issued the November 2024 Note in the aggregate principal amount of up to 259,588 to the Sponsor, which
will be deposited into the Trust Account for the benefit of each Public Share that was not redeemed in connection with the November 2024
Extension. The Sponsor agreed to pay 43,264.60 per month until the completion of an initial Business Combination, commencing on November
8, 2024 and continuing through May 8, 2025. The November 2024 Note bears no interest and is due and payable upon the earlier to occur
of (i) the date on which we consummate our Business Combination and (ii) the date that our winding up is effective. As of November 29,
2024, the Company had deposited 43,320 (including 55.40 of applicable interest) into the Company s Trust Account. 

We
could use a portion of the funds not being placed in the Trust Account to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist
us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision (a provision designed to keep
target businesses from shopping around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such
target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed initial Business Combination, although we do not have any current intention
to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that
would be used as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific initial
Business Combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach
or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to,
prospective target businesses. 

As
approved by the shareholders at the November 2024 EGM, we have until May 8, 2025 to complete a Business Combination. 

If
we are not able to consummate a Business Combination before May 8, 2025 (unless such date being extended further by our shareholder approval), we will commence an automatic winding up, dissolution
and liquidation. Our Management has determined that the automatic liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential
subsequent dissolution also raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one
year after the date that the unaudited condensed financial statements are issued. While Management intends to complete a Business Combination
on or before May 8, 2025, it is uncertain whether we will be able to do so. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of
assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after May 8, 2025.

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

Contractual
Obligations 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any long-term debt, capital or operating lease obligations. 

We
have entered into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we are paying our sponsor for office space, utilities and administrative
support services, in an amount of up to 3,000 per month. 

We
have engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an advisor in connection with our initial Business Combination to assist us in holding meetings with
our shareholders to discuss the potential initial Business Combination and the target business attributes, introduce us to potential
investors that are interested in purchasing our securities in connection with our initial Business Combination, assist us in obtaining
shareholder approval for the initial Business Combination and assist us with our press releases and public filings in connection with
the initial Business Combination. In connection with the Sunorange Investment, we have agreed to pay EarlyBirdCapital a reduced cash
fee for such services upon the consummation of our initial Business Combination in an amount equal to 1.75 of the gross proceeds of
our IPO (exclusive of any applicable finders fees which might become payable). 

We
previously engaged a third-party consultant to provide us with assistance in various aspects of our potential Business Combination. Pursuant
to the terms of the agreement, we have agreed to pay a contingent fee of at least 3,500,000 if we consummate a Business Combination.
No expense for which has been included in the unaudited condensed financial statements related to this agreement. No expense has been
recorded in the unaudited condensed financial statements related to this agreement, nor is any due. As of May 8, 2023, this agreement
was terminated. 

On
August 29, 2023, the Company engaged a third-party consultant to provide the Company with introduction to potential targets for its Business
Combination. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company has agreed to pay a contingent fee of 0.5 of the implied enterprise
value of the target if the Company consummates a Business Combination. On October 13, 2024, the agreement was amended and restated to,
among other things, reduce the contingent fee to 0.05 . As this amended agreement was a subsequent event and the Business Combination
is not considered probable, no expense for which has been included in the unaudited condensed financial statements related to this agreement. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited
condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those
estimates. As of the end of the reporting period, we have not identified any critical accounting estimates. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Management s
discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our audited financial information.
We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to
the financial statements included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements with those considered critical outlined
below. Our audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of our accounting policies require that Management
applies significant judgments in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, Management
reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our unaudited condensed financial statements are
presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends
and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree
of uncertainty, and, therefore, actual results could differ from our estimates. 

32 

Class
A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption 

We
account for our Class A Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity. Ordinary Shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured
at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares that feature redemption rights that are either within
the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control)
are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Ordinary Shares are classified as shareholder s equity. Our Class A Ordinary
Shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future
events. Accordingly, Class A Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside
of the shareholder s equity section of the balance sheet. 

Immediately
upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption amount. Increases
or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable Ordinary Shares are affected by charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated
deficit. 

Net
Income Per Ordinary Share 

We
comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Net income (loss) per share
is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the period. We have two
classes of shares, redeemable Ordinary Shares and non-redeemable Ordinary Shares. Our redeemable Ordinary Shares are comprised of Class
A Ordinary Shares sold in the Initial Public Offering. Our non-redeemable shares are comprised of Class A Ordinary Shares held by EarlyBirdCapital
and Class B Ordinary Shares purchased by the sponsor which were converted to Class A Ordinary Shares with the same original legend in
May 2023. Earnings and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Our unaudited condensed statements of operations
included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements applies the two-class method in calculating net income (loss)
per share. Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for redeemable Ordinary Shares and non-redeemable Ordinary Shares is calculated
by dividing net income (loss), allocated proportionally to each class of Ordinary Shares, attributable to us by the weighted average
number of shares of redeemable and non-redeemable Ordinary Shares outstanding. 

The
calculation of diluted income (loss) per Ordinary Share does not consider the effect of the Warrants issued in connection with the Initial
Public Offering since exercise of the Warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such rights would
be anti-dilutive. Accretion of the carrying value of Class A Ordinary Shares to redemption value is excluded from net income (loss) per
redeemable share because the redemption value approximates fair value. As a result, diluted income (loss) per share is the same as basic
income (loss) per share for the period presented. 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06. The update simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation
models in ASU 470-20 for convertible instruments and introducing other changes. As a result of ASU 2020-06, more convertible debt instruments
will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost and more convertible preference shares will be accounted for
as a single-equity instrument measured at its historical cost, as long as no features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives.
The amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2024. There was no material impact on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. 

In
June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03. The ASU amends ASC 820 to clarify that a contractual sales restriction is not considered in measuring
an equity security at fair value and to introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions
that are measured at fair value. The ASU applies to both holders and issuers of equity and Equity-Linked Securities measured at fair
value. The amendments in ASU 2022-03 are effective for the Company in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued
or made available for issuance. We adopted ASU 2022-03 on January 1, 2024. There was no material impact on our financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. 

33 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 in order to enhance the transparency and usefulness of income tax disclosures. The guidance
is applicable to all entities subject to income tax, and it will require disclosure of certain categories within the rate reconciliation
to improve consistency as well as disclosure of reconciling items which meet a certain quantitative threshold which will improve transparency.
Additionally, entities must disclose the amount of taxes paid to federal, state and foreign municipalities. For public business entities
ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact of its pending
adoption of ASU 2023-09 on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosure. 

We
do not believe that any other recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on our unaudited condensed financial statements contained in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements. 

JOBS
Act 

The
JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify
as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements
based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting
standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such
standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our unaudited condensed financial statements may not be comparable
to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

Additionally,
we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions
we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an independent registered public accounting firm s attestation report
on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure
that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii)
comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the independent
registered public accounting firm s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor
discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation
and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period
of five years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, 
whichever is earlier. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

34 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our Management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of the end of the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
of complex financial instruments, recognition of billed and unbilled professional fees, recognition of prepaid expenses, classification
of related party payables and accounting for related party notes payable as further described below. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. Specifically, we concluded that our controls over recognition of billed and unbilled professional fees, recognition
of prepaid expenses, the classification of related party payables, and accounting for related party notes payable was not effectively
designed or maintained. Our Management performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our unaudited condensed financial
statements included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly,
Management believes that the unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Report present fairly, in all material respects,
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the periods presented. 

In
light of the material weakness described above, our Management Team has performed additional accounting and financial analyses and other
post-closing procedures. We have enhanced, and will continue to enhance, internal controls and procedures, including access to accounting
literature, identification and consideration of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications
and implantation of additional layers of reviews in the financial close process. While we have processes to properly identify and evaluate
the appropriate accounting technical pronouncements and other literature for all significant or unusual transactions, we plan to continue
to improve these processes to ensure that the nuances of such transactions are effectively evaluated in the context of the increasingly
complex accounting standards. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than as discussed above, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended
September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

To
the knowledge of our Management Team, there is no material litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers
or directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

As
a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. For additional
risks relating to our operations, other than as set forth below, see the section titled Risk Factors contained in our (i)
IPO Registration Statement, (ii) 2023 Annual Report and (iii) Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31,
2023, June 30, 2023, and September 30, 2023, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on May 22, 2023, November 6, 2023,
December 14, 2023, May 20, 2024, and August 19, 2024, respectively. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse
effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business or ability
to consummate an initial Business Combination. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from
time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

35 

For
risks related to Scage and the Scage Business Combination, please see the Registration Statement on Form F-4 which was filed with the
SEC in connection with the Scage Business Combination on October 31, 2024. 

Since
we did not consummated our initial Business Combination by November 3, 2024, our securities have been suspended from trading
on Nasdaq and delisted. Any trading suspension or delisting could have a material adverse effect on the trading of our securities and
may adversely affect our ability to consummate an initial Business Combination. 

On
October 9, 2023, we received a deficiency notice from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying us that we no longer meet the minimum 400 total holders
requirement for The Nasdaq Global Market pursuant to Listing Rule 5450(a)(2) (the Minimum Total Holders Requirement ). The
notification received had no immediate effect on our Nasdaq listing. On November 24, 2023, we submitted to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance
with the Minimum Total Holders Requirement. 

On
January 22, 2024, we received a deficiency notice from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying us that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5620(a), which requires that Nasdaq-listed companies hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months of their fiscal
year end (the Annual Meeting Requirement ), because we did not hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months
of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The notification received had no immediate effect on our Nasdaq listing. On March 7, 2024,
we submitted to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Requirement. On May 2, 2024, we had an extraordinary general
meeting of shareholders in lieu of an annual general meeting, which satisfied such Annual Meeting Requirement. 

On
May 6, 2024, we received a deficiency notice from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying us that since it was first notified on October 9, 2023,
we had not regained compliance with the Minimum Total Holders Requirement by the end of the 180-day extension period ended April 8, 2024.
On May 13, 2024, the Company requested a hearing to appeal the determination, and the hearing was held on June 25, 2024. 

On
July 3, 2024, we received written notice (the July 2024 Decision from Nasdaq indicating that the Hearing Panel had granted
our request for continued listing on Nasdaq, subject to the Company completing a business combination with an operating entity and evidencing
compliance with the criteria for initial listing on Nasdaq, including the applicable holders requirement, by November 4, 2024. 

On
November 8, 2024, we received written notice from the Hearings Panel indicating that the Hearing Panel had determined to delist our securities
from Nasdaq and that trading in our securities would be suspended (the Trading Suspension at the open of trading on November
12, 2024 due to the Company s failure to satisfy the terms of the Hearing Panel s July 2024 Decision. Since such time, our
securities have been quoted on the OTC Markets under the tickers FNVUF, FNVTF, 
and FNVWF, respectively. 

Additionally, our
IPO Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on November 3, 2021. Pursuant to our Amended and Restated Charter, we have until May 8, 2025 (or such shorter period of time as determined
by our Board) to consummate our initial Business Combination. However, Nasdaq s rules currently provide that SPACs (such as us)
must satisfy certain listing conditions, including that a SPAC must complete one or more Business Combinations within 36 months of the
effectiveness of its initial public offering registration statement (the 36-Month Requirement ). If a SPAC does not meet
the 36-Month Requirement, it will be subject to a suspension of trading and delisting from Nasdaq. 

Under
the previous Nasdaq rule, a SPAC that was not in compliance with the 36-Month Requirement could request a hearing before the Hearing Panel, which would have the effect of staying any potential delisting. However, in rules
that became effective on October 7, 2024 (the New Nasdaq Rules ), which includes removing the stay relating to the 36-Month
Requirement Under the New Nasdaq Rules, a SPAC s Nasdaq-listed securities will be immediately suspended from trading through the
pendency of the Hearing Panel s review. In addition, the scope of the Hearing Panel s review is limited, as the Hearing Panel
may only reverse a delisting determination by the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (a Staff Delisting
Determination where it determines that the Staff Delisting Determination was made in error and that the SPAC never failed to
satisfy the 36-Month Requirement. In such cases, the Hearing Panel is no longer able to consider facts indicating that the SPAC had regained
compliance since the date of the Staff Delisting Determination, nor may the Hearing Panel grant an exception allowing the SPAC additional
time to regain compliance. If a SPAC completes a Business Combination after receiving a Staff Delisting Determination and/or demonstrates
compliance with all applicable initial listing requirements, the combined company will be apply to list its securities on Nasdaq pursuant
to the normal application review process. 

We
have not yet received a delisting notice due to failure to meet the 36-Month Requirement. Even if the Trading Suspension is lifted due
to a review process, we would still be subject to delisting under the 36-Month Requirement, as more than 36 months have passed from the
date of the IPO Prospectus. If we are delisted due to the 36-Month Requirement, Nasdaq may only reverse the determination to delist our
securities if it finds that it made a factual error when applying the new framework. 

Accordingly,
since we did not consummate our initial Business Combination on or prior to November 3, 2024, we will not be in compliance with the
New Nasdaq Rules, and our securities will be delisted. If Nasdaq were to delist our securities, our securities will continue to be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur,
we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

a
 limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 
 
 reduced
 liquidity for our securities; 
 
 a
 determination that our Class A Ordinary Shares are penny stock, which will
 require brokers trading in our Class A Ordinary Shares to adhere to more stringent rules
 and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market
 for our securities; 
 
 a
 limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 
 
 a
 decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

The
National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating
the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating
the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and,
if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case.
While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies,
other than the state of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers,
or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, since we are no
longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which
we offer our securities.

Our
Public Shareholders exercise of redemption rights with respect to a large number of Public Shares may affect our ability to complete
an initial Business Combination in the most desirable manner that will optimize the capital structure of the combined company, or at
all. 

Over
the past two years, the redemption rate of shares held by public shareholders of SPACs at the time of a shareholder meeting that approves
an amendment to the articles of the SPAC or the initial Business Combination of the SPAC has been very high, thereby increasing the likelihood
that we, too, may be subject to significant redemptions that may affect our ability to complete an initial Business Combination. In addition,
the amount of the deferred fee payable to the EarlyBirdCapital in connection with the Business Combination Marketing Agreement will not
be reduced for any Public Shares that are redeemed in connection with an extension or a Business Combination. If we are able to consummate
an initial Business Combination, the per-share value of Public Shares held by non-redeeming Public Shareholders following the Business
Combination will reflect our obligation to pay, and the payment of, such deferred fee to EarlyBirdCapital. 

In
connection with the (i) 2023 EGM, 12,626,668 Public Shares were redeemed at a price per Public Share of approximately 10.50; (ii) May
2024 EGM, 2,374,826 Public Shares were redeemed at a price per Public Share of approximately 11.33; and (iii) November 2024 EGM, 1,383,214
Public Shares were redeemed at a price per Public Share of approximately 11.68; thereby reducing the number of outstanding Public Shares,
as of November 6, 2024, to 865,292, and reducing the total amount held in the Trust Account to approximately 10.11 million. 

Due
to the high rates of redemptions of Public Shares in connection with shareholder votes on extensions or Business Combinations of SPACs,
we may need to rely upon significant PIPE or other outside financing to provide cash to our post- Business Combination company. Obtaining
financing in connection with initial Business Combinations of SPACs has in recent times been very difficult, with many financings available
only on terms that are onerous to the surviving company of the Business Combination. The failure to secure additional financing on reasonable
terms could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of the Sponsors or our
other shareholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial Business Combination. Raising additional
third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels or on onerous
terms. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete a Business Combination in the most desirable manner that will optimize
the capital structure of the combined company, or at all. If we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination, our Public Shareholders
may only receive approximately 11.68 per Public Share on the liquidation of our Trust Account, as of November 6, 2024, and our warrants
will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our Public Shareholders may receive less than 11.68 per share on the redemption of their
Public Shares.

Use
of Proceeds 

For
a description of the use of proceeds generated in our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, see Part II, Item 2 of our Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on November 10, 2022. There has been no
material change in the planned use of proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement as described in the IPO Registration
Statement. The specific investments in our Trust Account may change from time to time. 

On
November 1, 2023, we instructed Continental to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the
Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at Morgan Stanley, with Continental continuing to act as trustee, until the
earlier of the consummation of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments
in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement are no longer invested in U.S. government
securities or money market funds invested in U.S. government securities. 

Purchases
of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 

On November 6, 2024, we held
an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the November 2024 EGM to amend our Amended and Restated Memorandum to
approve an extension of the Company s termination date from November 8, 2024 to May 8, 2025 (the November 2024 Extension ).
Shareholders holding 1,383,214 shares of the Company s Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a
pro rata portion of the funds in the Company s Trust Account. As a result, approximately 16.16 million (approximately 11.68 per
share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. 

There were no such repurchases of our equity securities by us or an affiliate during the quarterly period Cover ed

Attention: Calvin Kung, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 

Re: Finder s Agreement 

Dear Mr. Kung: 

WHEREAS,
the parties previously amended and restated the Finder s Agreement dated May 12, 2023, pursuant to an amendment dated August 29,
2023; 

WHEREAS,
the parties now desire to further amend and restate the Finder s Agreement as set forth below. 

This second amended and restated
letter agreement (the Agreement is made and entered into as of October 13, 2024, and confirms the engagement
by Finnovate Acquisition Corporation, a Cayman Islands company (sometimes referred to as the Company or you ),
of 3A Partners Limited, a Hong Kong incorporated limited liability company (sometimes referred to as the Finder 
or we ), to assist the Company on a non-exclusive basis in its search for a merger, capital stock exchange,
acquisition, or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities that would qualify as the Company s initial
business combination as described in the Prospectus (as defined below) (a Transaction ). 

Accordingly, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows: 

1. Services
of Finder . Finder will use its best efforts to introduce the Company to the Target set forth on Exhibit A . It is understood
that the Company will be under no obligation to enter into a Transaction with the Target and the Company will be within its rights to
decline any offer made in connection with a Transaction at anytime. Finder will perform its services under this Agreement (a) in accordance
with all laws, rules and regulations which may be applicable to such services, (b) in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance
with generally recognized industry standards for similar services, and (c) devoting sufficient resources and its reasonable efforts to
ensure that such services are performed in a timely, professional and reliable manner. 

2. Compensation .
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon the closing of a Transaction with the Target, the Company shall pay to Finder
a fee in cash equal to zero point zero five percent (0.05 (the Fee Percentage of the implied enterprise
value of the Target (total value of all Target company outstanding capital stock plus consolidated debt less consolidated cash) provided
for in the Transaction immediately prior to the closing of the Transaction (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding the Company s
equity interests, assets and liabilities) (the Fee ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any
portion of the consideration paid by the Company to the Target or the Target s security holders is held in escrow, subject to earnout
or otherwise contingent as of the closing of the Transaction Contingent Consideration ), the amount of the
Fee payable by the Company at the closing of the Transaction will be reduced by the amount of such Contingent Consideration multiplied
by the Fee Percentage, and as, when and to the extent that any portion of the Contingent Consideration is finally paid or delivered without
contingency, the Company will promptly thereafter pay to Finder as part of the Fee hereunder an amount equal the amount of the Contingent
Consideration that has been finally paid or delivered without contingency multiplied by the Fee Percentage. With consent by Finder, all
or any portion of the Fee may be payable in newly-issued shares of its ordinary shares (or the common equity of any successor public entity
in the Transaction) (the Fee Shares ), with each Fee Share valued at the redemption price available to the
Company s Public Stockholders (as defined below) who redeem their shares in connection with the Transaction (subject, in the case
of Fee Shares issued by any successor public entity, as equitably adjusted for the exchange ratio of the Company s public ordinary
shares for the successor entity public common stock in the Transaction). In addition to any restrictions on transfer imposed by applicable
securities laws, any such Fee Shares shall be subject to a lock-up substantially identical to the lock-up that applies to the founder
shares held by the Sponsor (as defined below), as set forth in the letter agreement, dated November 8, 2021 as amended, by and among the
Company, the Sponsor and certain other insiders named therein, as it may be amended. 

3. Termination
of Agreement . This Agreement and Finder s engagement hereunder may be terminated by either party (i) at any time for convenience
upon ten (10) business days notice thereof to the other party (a Convenience Termination or (ii) in
the event that the other party materially breaches or defaults on its obligations under this Agreement and does not cure or remedy such
breach or default within ten (10) days after such breaching or defaulting party s receipt of written notice of such breach or default
from the other party (a Cause Termination ). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
within the twelve (12) months following a termination by the Company for a Convenience Termination of by Finder for a Cause Termination,
the Company or any of its affiliates consummates a Transaction with the Target, Finder will be entitled to payment in full of its Fees
under Section 2 upon the consummation of such Transaction (for the avoidance of doubt, no Fees will be payable in the event of
a termination of this Agreement by Finder for a Convenience Termination or by the Company for a Cause Termination. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement, any of the terms herein expressly contemplated to survive the termination hereof, along with the NDA, shall
continue in accordance with the terms thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions of Section
7 below shall survive indefinitely. 

4. Non-Circumvention. 
The Company agrees that it will not, in any manner, directly or indirectly, circumvent or attempt to circumvent this Agreement or the
benefits to which Finder would otherwise be entitled to by virtue of introducing the Company to the Target as contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company agrees that it shall not directly or indirectly consummate any Transaction with the Target without compensating
Finder as and to the extent required herein. 

5. FINRA .
Finder represents that it is a member in good standing of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), or if membership
with FINRA or any similar regulatory body is not required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that
no such membership is required, and that Finder has complied with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to the transactions
contemplated herein. 

6. Confidentiality .
The parties acknowledge and affirm the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of May 12, 2023 (the NDA ),
between the Company and Finder, and acknowledge that the NDA will apply to this Agreement, any information of or relating to Target or
the Company s discussions with Target, and the services to be provided hereunder. Finder acknowledges that the existence and terms
of this Agreement and the services hereunder are to be kept confidential by Finder in accordance with the requirements of the NDA. If
requested by the Company, Finder will sign a joinder agreement or other separate agreement with the Company or the Target to become bound
as an agent or representative of the Company by the terms of any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement that the Company may sign
with the Target.

7. Waiver
Against Trust . Reference is made to the final prospectus of SPAC, dated as of November 3, 2021 and filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (File No. 333-260261) on November 4, 2021 (the Prospectus ). Finder hereby represents
and warrants that it has read the Prospectus and understands that the Company has established a trust account (the Trust
Account containing the proceeds of its initial public offering (the IPO and the overallotment
shares acquired by its underwriters and from certain private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO (including interest accrued
from time to time thereon) for the benefit of the Company s public stockholders (including overallotment shares acquired by the
Company s underwriters, the Public Stockholders ), and that, except as otherwise described in the Prospectus,
the Company may disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to the Public Stockholders in the event they elect to redeem their Company
shares in connection with the consummation of the Company s initial business combination (as such term is used in the Prospectus)
(the Business Combination or in connection with an extension of its deadline to consummate a Business Combination,
(b) to the Public Stockholders if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination within eighteen (18) months after the closing
of the IPO, subject to extension by an amendment to SPAC s organizational documents or (c) to the Company after or concurrently
with the consummation of a Business Combination. For and in consideration of the Company entering into this Agreement, and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Finder hereby agrees on behalf of itself and
its affiliates that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Finder nor any of its affiliates do now or shall
at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or distributions therefrom,
or make any claim against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such claim arises as a result
of, in connection with or relating in any way to, this Agreement or any proposed or actual business relationship between the Company or
its Representatives, on the one hand, and Finder or its Representatives, on the other hand, or any other matter, and regardless of whether
such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (collectively, the Released Claims ).
Finder on behalf of itself and its affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any Released Claims that Finder or any of its affiliates may have
against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations,
contracts or agreements with the Company or its Representatives and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account (including any distributions
therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of this Agreement or any other agreement with the Company or its
affiliates). Finder agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by
the Company and its affiliates to induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, and Finder further intends and understands such waiver
to be valid, binding and enforceable against Finder and each of its affiliates under applicable law. To the extent Finder or any of its
affiliates commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to the
Company or its Representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against the Company or its Representatives,
Finder hereby acknowledges and agrees that Finder s and its affiliates sole remedy shall be against funds held outside of
the Trust Account and that such claim shall not permit Finder or its affiliates (or any person claiming on any of their behalves or in
lieu of any of them) to have any claim against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained therein.
In the event Finder or any of its affiliates commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising
out of any matter relating to the Company or its Representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, relief against the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom) or the Public Stockholders, whether in the form of money damages or injunctive relief,
the Company and its Representatives, as applicable, shall be entitled to recover from Finder and its affiliates the associated legal fees
and costs in connection with any such action, in the event the Company or its Representatives, as applicable, prevails in such action
or proceeding. 

8. Finder
Independent Contractor Status . The parties acknowledge and agree that Finder has been retained solely to provide the services set
forth in this Agreement and that no fiduciary or agency relationship between the Company and Finder has been created in respect of Finder s
engagement hereunder, regardless of whether Finder has advised or is advising the Company on other matters. In connection with this engagement,
Finder is acting as an independent contractor, and not that of an employee, agent, partner or joint venturer or any other relationship,
and nothing in this Agreement, including the performance by Finder hereunder, shall create a employee-employer, principle-agent, partnership,
joint venture or any other relationship with the Company. As an independent contractor of the Company, Finder shall not have any authority
to bind, make any representation or commitment or act on behalf of the Company except as expressly authorized by the Company. The Company
understands that Finder is not undertaking to provide any legal, accounting or tax advice in connection with the Transaction. Finder shall
not be responsible for the underlying business decision of the Company to effect a Transaction with the Target or for the advice or services
provided by any of the Company s other advisors or independent contractors.
