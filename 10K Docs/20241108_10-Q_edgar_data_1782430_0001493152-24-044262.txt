and of the outstanding OP
units as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

As
the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has the exclusive power under the partnership agreement to manage
and conduct the business affairs of the Operating Partnership, subject to certain limited approval and voting rights of the limited partners.
The Company may cause the Operating Partnership to issue additional OP units in connection with property acquisitions, compensation or
otherwise. The Company became a publicly traded entity on September 21, 2022. 

The
Company is engaged in the ownership, acquisition, financing and triple-net leasing of skilled nursing facilities and other post-acute
healthcare properties. The Company s portfolio consists of 104 healthcare properties with an aggregate of 12,889 licensed beds.
The Company holds fee title to 103 of these properties and holds 1 property under a long-term lease. These properties are located in
Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. The Company generates substantially all of its
revenues by leasing its properties to tenants under long-term leases primarily on a triple-net basis, under which the tenant pays the
cost of real estate taxes, insurance and other operating costs of the facility and capital expenditures. Each healthcare facility located
at its properties is managed by a qualified operator with an experienced management team. 

Interim
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

The
accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim
financial information, and the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules for interim financial reporting. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in the condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP have been omitted pursuant to such rules
and regulations. However, in the opinion of management, the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect
all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company s condensed consolidated financial position as of September
30, 2024, and the condensed consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The condensed consolidated results
of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for any subsequent interim
period or for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. 

Variable
Interest Entity 

The
Company consolidates the Operating Partnership, a variable interest entity VIE in which the Company is considered the
primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact
the entity s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the
VIE that could be significant to the VIE. 

Non-Controlling
Interest 

A
non-controlling interest is defined as the portion of the equity in an entity not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the primary
beneficiary. Non-controlling interests are required to be presented as a separate component of equity on a condensed consolidated balance
sheets. Accordingly, the presentation of net income is modified to present the income attributed to controlling and non-controlling interests.
The non-controlling interest on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets represents OP units not held by the Company
and represents approximately and of the outstanding OP Units issued by the Operating Partnership as of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, respectively. The holders of these OP units are entitled to share in cash distributions from the Operating Partnership
in proportion to their percentage ownership of OP units. Net income is allocated to the non-controlling interest based on the weighted
average of OP units outstanding during the period. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
Company maintains its accounting records on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America GAAP ).

 a
 calculation based on the Consumer Price Index; or 

(iii) 
 specific
 dollar increases. 

Contingent
revenue is not recognized until all possible contingencies have been eliminated. The Company considers the operating history of the lessee
and the general condition of the industry when evaluating whether all possible contingencies have been eliminated and have historically,
and expect in the future, to not include contingent rents as income until received. The Company follows a policy related to rental income
whereby the Company considers a lease to be non-performing after 60 days of non-payment of past due amounts and does not recognize unpaid
rental income from that lease until the amounts have been received. 

Rental
revenues relating to non-contingent leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease are recognized on the straight-line
basis. Recognizing income on a straight-line basis requires us to calculate the total non-contingent rent containing specified rental
increases over the life of the lease and to recognize the revenue evenly over that life. This method results in rental income in the
early years of a lease being higher than actual cash received, creating a straight-line rent receivable asset included in our accompanying
condensed consolidated balance sheets. At some point during the lease, depending on its terms, the cash rent payments eventually exceed
the straight-line rent which results in the straight-line rent receivable asset decreasing to zero over the remainder of the lease term.
The Company assesses the collectability of straight-line rent in accordance with the applicable accounting standards and reserve policy.
If the lessee becomes delinquent in rent owed under the terms of the lease, the Company may provide a reserve against the recognized
straight-line rent receivable asset for a portion, up to its full value, that the Company estimates may not be recoverable.

In
each of these complaints, the plaintiffs asserted claims for fraud, breach of contract and rescission arising out of the defendants 
alleged failure to perform certain post-closing obligations under the purchase contracts. We have potential direct exposure for these
claims because the subsidiaries of the Predecessor Company that were named as defendants are now subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.
Additionally, the Operating Partnership is potentially liable for the claims made against Moishe Gubin, Michael Blisko and the Predecessor
Company pursuant to the provisions of the contribution agreement, under which the Operating Partnership assumed all of the liabilities
of the Predecessor Company and agreed to indemnify the Predecessor Company and its affiliates for such liabilities. We and the named
defendants believe that the claims set forth in the complaints are without merit. The named defendants intend to vigorously defend the
litigation and to assert counterclaims against the plaintiffs based on their failure to fulfill their obligations under the purchase
contracts, interim management agreement, and operations transfer agreements. We believe this matter will be resolved without a material
adverse effect to the Company. 

As
noted above, the March 2020 and January 2021 and April 2024 complaints also related to the Predecessor Company s planned acquisition
of five properties located in Massachusetts. A subsidiary of the Predecessor Company purchased loans related to these properties in 2018
for a price of million with the expectation that the subsidiaries would acquire title to the properties and the loans would be
retired. The subsidiary subsequently advanced million under the loans to satisfy other liabilities related to the properties. The
planned acquisition/settlement with the sellers/owners and/borrowers was not consummated because the underlying tenants of the properties
surrendered their licenses to operate healthcare facilities on these properties. 

The
Predecessor Company intends to institute legal proceedings to collect the outstanding amount of these loans and to assert related claims
against the sellers and their principals for the unpaid principal balances as well as protective advances and collection costs. In connection
with enforcing their rights, in July 2022, the Company foreclosed, and (as lender) sold four of the five properties at auction for the
total amount of million. In December 2022, the Company took title on the fifth property with an estimated fair value of million.

Interest
expense, net: The increase in interest expense of 725 thousand or 9.2 is primarily due to an increase in the additional interest
on a new loan from Popular Bank, the Series A Bond issuance and a Series D Bonds issuance that occurred since 3Q 2023. 

Net
Income : The increase in net income from 4.7 million during the third quarter of 2023, to 6.9 million income during the third quarter
of 2024 is primarily a result of higher rental income in the third quarter of 2024 offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses,
higher interest expense, lower general and administrative expenses, and lower property taxes.

Rental
revenues: The increase in rental revenue of 12.2 million or 16.5 is due to renegotiation of certain leases, acquisition of new
properties and renewal of leases. 

Depreciation
and Amortization: The increase in depreciation and amortization of 3.4 million or 16.0 is primarily purchases of new properties
and lease rights offset by lower depreciation from fully depreciated assets. 

Loss
on real estate investment impairment: In February 2023, one facility under one of our southern Illinois master leases was closed.
The closure was made at the request of the tenant and was mainly for efficiency reasons. This facility was leased under a master lease
with two other facilities. The closure did not result in any reduction in the aggregate rent payable under the master lease, which was
paid without interruption. However, the closure did result in a write off of the remaining book value of the property and an impairment
loss on the P L. On April 30, 2024, the company sold the property to The Village of Smithton, a municipality in Illinois, and paid
off the outstanding mortgage. The sale of the property did not result in any material P L impact. 

General
and administrative: The increase in general and administrative of 1.1 million or 27.4 is primarily a result of higher insurance,
higher corporate salaries and other expenses.

Item

Results
of Operations (continued) 

Interest
expense, net: The increase in interest expense of 6.0 million or 33.6 is primarily related to additional interest on a new loan
from Popular Bank, a Series A bond issuance and a Series D bond issuance that occurred since the third quarter of 2023 

Miscellaneous
Expense: The decrease in miscellaneous expense of 1.0 million is the result of a fee paid to an investment banking firm in connection
with the cancellation of an agreement with respect to a proposed financing transaction. 

Net
Incom e: The increase in net income to 19.9 million in 2024 from 14.5 million in same period last year (37.2 increase) is primarily
a result of higher rental income in 2024 offset by higher interest expenses, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher general
and administrative expenses, lower property taxes and the absence of a real estate impairment loss. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

To
qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined
without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis. Accordingly,
we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly dividends to common stockholders from cash flow from operating
activities. All such dividends are at the discretion of our board of directors. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and equivalents of 53.2 million. We also had the ability
to offer an additional 98 million in Series A, 144 million in Series C Bonds and an additional 108 million in Series D Bonds subject
to compliance with covenants and market conditions. 

Liquidity
is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain
our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs. Our primary sources of cash include
operating cash flows, stock sales and borrowings. Our primary uses of cash include funding acquisitions and investments consistent with
our investment strategy, repaying principal and interest on any outstanding borrowings, making distributions to our equity holders, funding
our operations and paying accrued expenses. 

Our
long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional healthcare properties and
principal and interest payments on our debt. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital,
including future equity issuances or debt offerings, net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured
and unsecured borrowings. 

39 

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources (continued) 

We
may utilize various types of debt to finance a portion of our acquisition activities, including long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans,
variable-rate term loans and secured revolving lines of credit. As of September 30, 2024, on a condensed consolidated basis, we had total
indebtedness of approximately 584.5 million, consisting of 264.1 million in HUD guaranteed debt, 155.7 million in Series A Bonds,
Series C Bonds, and Series D gross bonds outstanding and 164.7 million in commercial mortgages loans. Under our bonds and our commercial
mortgages loans, we are subject to continuing covenants, and future indebtedness that we may incur may contain similar provisions. In
the event of a default, the lenders could accelerate the timing of payments under the debt obligations, and we may be required to repay
such debt with capital from other sources, which may not be available on attractive terms, or at all, which would have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 

Through
2028 there are five balloon payment obligations consisting of a payment of 46.5 million due under Series A Bonds in 2026, 51.4 million
due under the Series C Bonds in 2026, a payment of 47.2 million due under the Series D Bonds in 2026, a payment of 86.1 million due
under our commercial bank mortgage loan facility due in 2027, and a payment of 60.7 million due under our commercial bank mortgage loan
facility due in 2028. We may also obtain additional financing that contains balloon payment obligations. These types of obligations may
materially adversely affect us, including our cash flows, financial condition and ability to make distributions. 

The
Company believes that its overall level of indebtedness is appropriate for the Company s business in light of its cash flow from
operations and value of its properties and is generally typical for owners of multiple healthcare properties. The Company expects to
generate sufficient positive cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing debt service obligations and the distribution requirements
for maintaining REIT status.

netted 22.4 million, a private placement of Series D Bonds 19.1 million, a new HUD loan of 3.2 million and a commercial bank facility
of 66 million. These amounts were offset by 15.3 million in principal debt payments, dividends paid to common shareholders of 2.1
million, a 15.2 million distribution to the non-controlling interest holders and repayment of non-controlling interest redemption liability
of 15.8 million.

Mortgage
Loans Guaranteed by HUD 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had non-recourse mortgage loans of 264.1 million from third party lenders that were guaranteed by HUD. 

Each
loan is secured by first mortgages on certain specified properties, interests in the leases for these properties and second liens on
the operator s assets. In the event of default on any single loan, the loan agreement provides that the applicable lender may require
the tenants for the property securing the loan to make all rental payments directly to the lender. In exchange for the HUD guarantee,
we pay HUD, on an annual basis, 0.65 of the principal balance of each loan as mortgage insurance premium, in addition to the interest
rate denominated in each loan agreement. As a result, the overall average interest rate paid with respect to the HUD guaranteed loans
as of September 30, 2024, was 3.91 per annum (including the mortgage insurance payments). The loans have an average maturity of 25.0
years. 

Commercial
Bank Term Loan 

On March 21, 2022, the Company obtained a mortgage loan facility with a commercial bank pursuant to which the Company
borrowed approximately 105 million. The facility provides for monthly payments of principal and interest based on a 20-year amortization
with a balloon payment due in March 2027. The interest rate is based on the one-month SOFR plus a margin of 3.5 and a floor of 4 (as
of September 30, 2024 the interest rate was 8.42 ). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total amounts outstanding were 95.1
million and 98.8 million, respectively. This facility loan is collateralized by 21 properties owned by the Company. The loan proceeds
were used to repay the Series B Bonds and prepay commercial loans not secured by HUD guaranteed mortgages. 

On August 25, 2023, the Company closed a mortgage loan facility with a commercial bank pursuant to which the Company
borrowed approximately 66 million. The facility is an interest only facility for the first 12 months and provides for monthly payments
of principal based on a 20-year amortization starting in the second year with a balloon payment due in August 2028. The rate is based
on the one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a margin of 3.5 and a floor of 4 (as of September 30, 2024,
the rate was 8.42 ). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total amounts outstanding were 65.3 million and 66.0 million, respectively.
This facility loan is collateralized by and used for the acquisition of 19 properties (24 facilities). 

The
loan agreement covenants consist of (i) a covenant that the ratio of the Company s indebtedness to its EBITDA cannot exceed 8.0
to 1, (ii) a covenant that the ratio of the Company s net operating income to its debt service before dividend distribution is
at least 1.20 to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter as measured pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement, (iii) a covenant that the ratio
of the Company s net operating income to its debt service after dividend distribution is at least 1.05 to 1.00 for each fiscal
quarter as measured pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement, and (iii) a covenant that the Company s GAAP equity is at least
 20.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the loan covenants. 

On
September 25 th , 2024, The Company assumed a 2.8 million dollar mortgage as part of the purchase of the Mabry property in
Gainsborough, Tennessee. Principal and interest are due in monthly payments starting in October 2024. The loan interest rate is
fixed at 6.25 and the balance is due on April 23 rd , 2026 .

Funds
From Operations FFO 

The
Company believes that funds from operations FFO ), as defined in accordance with the definition used by the National Association
of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), and adjusted funds from operations AFFO are important non-GAAP
supplemental measures of our operating performance. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires
straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably
over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating
results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental
measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income,
as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions,
plus real estate depreciation and amortization. AFFO is defined as FFO excluding the impact of straight-line rent, above-/below-market
leases, non-cash compensation and certain non-recurring items. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations,
improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among REITs more meaningful.
We consider FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding the
applicable items listed above, FFO and AFFO can help investors compare our operating performance between periods or as compared to other
companies. 

While
FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations
or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating
performance. FFO and AFFO also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor do
they purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO and AFFO may not
be comparable to FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that
interpret the current NAREIT definition or define AFFO differently than we do. 

The
following table reconciles our calculations of FFO and AFFO for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, to net income
the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the same periods:

Subsequent
Events 

On
October 8, 2024, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with an unaffiliated seller with respect to eight healthcare
facilities located in Missouri. The purchase price for the facilities is 87,500,000, payable at the closing. The facilities are
currently leased under a master lease agreement to a group of third- party tenants. Under the master lease, the tenants currently
pay annual rent on a triple net basis. The eight facilities are comprised of 1,111 licensed beds. The Company plans to purchase the
facilities utilizing the Company s current working capital and funds provided by a third-party lender. The Company anticipates
closing the acquisition before year-end; however, we can give no assurance that the closing will occur within this timeframe, or at
all. The potential acquisition of the facilities is subject to substantial conditions to closing. 

On
October 11, 2024 the Company acquired an 86-bed skilled nursing facility in Indianapolis, Indiana. The acquisition was for 6.0 million
and the Company funded the acquisition utilizing cash from its balance sheet. The facility was added to an existing master lease with
Infinity of Indiana. 

On
October 14, 2024, the BVI Company issued additional Series C debentures with a par value of NIS 62.0 million 16.5 million) and raised
a gross amount of NIS 61.6 million 16.4 million). The debentures were issued at a price of 99.3 to par. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification, as published by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or
other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our
financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual
results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently
uncertain. Please refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in the Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2023 Annual Report on 10-K filed on March 19, 2024 for further
information regarding the critical accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation
of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been
no material changes in such critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 

Market
risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other
market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business and investment objectives, we expect that the primary
market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk. 

We
may be exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt used to acquire properties. As of September
30, 2024, we had 49.7 million outstanding under our Series A Bonds, which bear a fixed rate of 6.97 , 55.4 million outstanding under
our Series C Bonds, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.7 per annum, 50.6 million outstanding under our Series D Bonds, which
bear interest at a fixed rate of 9.1 per annum, and 428.8 million in notes, of which 264.1 million are HUD guaranteed debt at a fixed
interest rate of 3.91 , 2.8 million is a mortgage assumed in the Mabry purchase which carries an interest rate of 6.25 and 161.9 million
(29.4 of total debt) are floating rate debt, which bears interest at a variable rate equal to one-month SOFR plus a margin of 3.5 and
a floor of 4 (as of September 30, 2024 the rate was 8.42 ). On September 30, 2024, the one-month SOFR was 4.96 . Assuming no increase
in the amount of our variable interest rate debt, if one-month SOFR increased 100 basis points, our annual cash flow would decrease by
approximately 1.6 million. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings
and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. We also
may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a
related financial instrument. 

44 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks (continued) 

In
addition to changes in interest rates, the value of our future investments is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional
economic conditions, changes in currency rates between the Israeli Shekel and the U.S. Dollar and changes in the creditworthiness of
tenants/operators, which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
regulations and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the
reasonable assurance level, as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

We
are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, that are not covered by insurance and expected to be resolved within policy
limits, other than the following: 

In
March 2020, Joseph Schwartz, Rosie Schwartz and certain companies owned by them filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois against Moishe Gubin, Michael Blisko, the Predecessor Company and 21 of its subsidiaries, as well as the
operators of 17 of the facilities operated at our properties. The complaint was related to the Predecessor Company s acquisition
of 16 properties located in Arkansas and Kentucky that were completed between May 2018 and April 2019 and the attempt to purchase an
additional 5 properties located in Massachusetts. The complaint was dismissed by the court in 2020 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
The plaintiffs did not file an appeal with respect to this action, and the time for an appeal has expired. 

In
August 2020, Joseph Schwartz, Rosie Schwartz and several companies controlled by them filed a second complaint in the Circuit Court in
Pulaski County, Arkansas. The second complaint had nearly identical claims as the federal case, but was limited to matters related to
the Predecessor Company s acquisition of properties located in Arkansas. The sellers, which were affiliates of Skyline Health Care,
had encountered financial difficulties and requested the Predecessor Company to acquire these properties. The defendants have filed an
answer denying the plaintiffs claims and asserting counterclaims based on breach of contract. This case has been dismissed without
prejudice. 

In
January 2021, Joseph Schwartz, Rosie Schwartz and certain companies owned by them filed a third complaint in Illinois state court in
Cook County, Illinois, which has nearly identical claims to the initial federal case but was limited to claims related to the Kentucky
and Massachusetts properties. The complaint has not been properly served on any of the defendants, and, accordingly, the defendants did
not respond to the complaint. Instead, the defendants filed a motion to quash service of process. On January 11, 2023, the Cook County
Circuit Court entered an order granting such motion, quashing service of process on all defendants. In March 2023, the plaintiffs filed
a new complaint and again attempted to serve it on the defendants. It is the defendants position that service was (once again,
potentially) defective and sought a dismissal of the matter for want of prosecution by Joseph Schwartz, Rosie Schwartz and certain companies
owned by them. The dismissal was granted, but has been appealed to the Illinois Appellate Court, and now has been dismissed. 

In
April of 2024 . Joseph Schwartz, Rosie Schwartz and several companies controlled by them filed a third complaint in the Circuit Court
in Pulaski County, Arkansas. This third complaint had nearly identical claims as the federal case and the Illinois state court matter. 

In
each of these complaints, the plaintiffs asserted claims for fraud, breach of contract and rescission arising out of the defendants 
alleged failure to perform certain post-closing obligations under the purchase contracts. We have potential direct exposure for these
claims because the subsidiaries of the Predecessor Company that were named as defendants are now subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.
Additionally, the Operating Partnership is potentially liable for the claims made against Moishe Gubin, Michael Blisko and the Predecessor
Company pursuant to the provisions of the contribution agreement, under which the Operating Partnership assumed all of the liabilities
of the Predecessor Company and agreed to indemnify the Predecessor Company and its affiliates for such liabilities. We and the named
defendants believe that the claims set forth in the complaints are without merit. The named defendants intend to vigorously defend the
litigation and to assert counterclaims against the plaintiffs based on their failure to fulfil their obligations under the purchase contracts,
interim management agreement, and operations transfer agreements. We believe this matter will be resolved without a material adverse
effect to the Company. 

As
noted above, the March 2020 and January 2021 and April 2024 complaints also related to the Predecessor Company s planned acquisition
of five properties located in Massachusetts. A subsidiary of the Predecessor Company purchased loans related to these properties in 2018
for a price of 7.74 million with the expectation that the subsidiaries would acquire title to the properties and the loans would be
retired. The subsidiaries subsequently advanced 3.1 million under the loans to satisfy other liabilities related to the properties.
The planned acquisition/settlement with the sellers/owners and borrowers was not consummated because the underlying tenants of the properties
surrendered their licenses to operate healthcare facilities on these properties. 

The
Predecessor Company intends to institute legal proceedings to collect the outstanding amount of these loans and to assert related claims
against the sellers and their principals for the unpaid principal balances as well as protective advances and collection costs. In connection
with enforcing their rights, in July 2022, the Company foreclosed, and (as lender) sold four of the five properties at auction for the
total amount of 4.4 million. In December 2022, the Company took title on the fifth property with an estimated fair value of 1.2 million.
