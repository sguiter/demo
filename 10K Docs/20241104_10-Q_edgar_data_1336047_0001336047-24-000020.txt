million in damages, plus pre-judgment interest (approximately million), post-judgment interest and attorneys' fees. The Trial Court's ruling and damages award was against Boardwalk GP, and not the Company or its subsidiaries. 
 
 The Defendants believed that the Trial Court ruling included factual and legal errors. Therefore, on January 3, 2022, the Defendants appealed the Trial Court's ruling to the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware (the Supreme Court). On January 17, 2022, the Plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal to the Supreme Court contesting the calculation of damages by the Trial Court. Oral arguments were held on September 14, 2022, and on December 19, 2022, the Supreme Court reversed the Trial Court's ruling and remanded the case to the Trial Court for further proceedings related to claims not decided by the Trial Court's ruling.

In September 2024, the Trial Court ruled in favor of the Defendants on all of the remanded issues. On October 21, 2024, the Plaintiffs appealed the Trial Court's ruling on the remanded issues to the Supreme Court. 
 
 City of New Orleans Litigation 
 
 Gulf South Pipeline Company, LLC (Gulf South), along with several other energy companies operating in Southern Louisiana, has been named as a defendant in a petition for damages and injunctive relief in state district court for Orleans Parish, Louisiana, (Case No. 19-3466) by the City of New Orleans. The case was filed on March 29, 2019. The lawsuit claims include, among other things, negligence, strict liability, nuisance and breach of contract, alleging that the defendants' drilling, dredging, pipeline and industrial operations since the 1930s have caused increased storm surge risk, increased flood protection costs and unspecified damages to the City of New Orleans. In October 2020, this case was stayed pending the outcome of a consolidated appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in a similar case. On August 5, 2021, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the oil-and-gas defendants in that consolidated appeal, finding that the cases being appealed should be re-examined in federal district court since they involve operations that were federally overseen at the time. The ruling reverses a previous decision that allowed the cases to be heard in state court, which the plaintiffs had sought. As a result of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision, it is anticipated that this case will be reviewed in federal district court to determine whether the case should be heard in that court. Discovery has been initiated. 
 
 Gulf South and Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (Texas Gas) have been named as defendants in several suits in the State of Louisiana that are similar in nature to the City of New Orleans Litigation discussed above. These cases were filed in Louisiana state courts and discovery is ongoing. One of these cases was settled in the second quarter 2024 and it did not have a material impact to the Company's results of operations or equity. 
 
 Regulatory Cost Recovery Mechanism 
 
 On May 1, 2024, Gulf South filed with the FERC a regulatory cost recovery mechanism, to be included in Gulf South's tariff, that would allow Gulf South to track and recover, via a surcharge, the costs of complying with certain new environmental regulatory requirements and regulatory requirements imposed by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Gulf South requested that the regulatory cost recovery mechanism have an initial term of five years beginning on November 1, 2024. On October 31, 2024, Gulf South received an order from the FERC rejecting the cost recovery mechanism. 
 
 Commitments for Construction 
 
 The Company's future capital commitments are comprised of binding commitments under purchase orders for materials ordered but not received and firm commitments under binding construction service agreements. As of September 30, 2024, the commitments were approximately million, all of which are expected to be settled within the next twelve months.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, included elsewhere in this report, and prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and our consolidated financial statements, related notes, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K). 
 
 We primarily operate in the midstream portion of the natural gas and natural gas liquids and other hydrocarbons industry, providing transportation and storage for those commodities. We also provide ethane supply services for industrial customers in Louisiana and Texas. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Note 2 in Part II, Item 8. of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a summary of our revenue contracts and the related revenue recognition policies. A significant portion of our revenues are fee-based, being derived from capacity reservation charges under firm agreements with customers, which do not vary significantly period to period, but are impacted by longer-term trends in our business such as changes in pricing on contract renewals and other factors. We have little to no direct commodity price exposure. Our operating costs and expenses do not vary significantly based upon the amount of products transported, with the exception of costs recorded in Costs associated with service revenues on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Our operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by our compliance with the requirements of, among other regulations, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration Mega Rule and our efforts to monitor, control and reduce emissions, as further discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 We use earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a non-GAAP measure, as a financial measure to assess our operating and financial performance and return on invested capital. We believe that some investors may find this measure useful in evaluating our performance. 
 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA (in millions): 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net income 368.8 266.9 Income taxes 
 0.8 0.6 Depreciation and amortization 317.7 302.9 Interest expense 137.0 116.7 Interest income (22.2) (11.7) EBITDA 802.1 675.4 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Our net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 101.9 million, or 38 , to 368.8 million compared to 266.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 126.7 million, or 19 , to 802.1 million as compared to the comparable 2023 period. Our net income and EBITDA increased primarily due to the factors discussed below, and also included increases of 11.5 million and 19.6 million from the acquisition of Williams Olefins Pipeline Holdco, LLC (Bayou Ethane) in September 2023. 
 
 Operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 352.8 million, or 32 , to 1,461.5 million compared to 1,108.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the fourth quarter 2023, a customer released its no-notice service (NNS) into separate transportation and storage services, which resulted in an increase of storage revenues and a reduction in transportation revenues of 19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the comparable period in 2023. Excluding the 19.1 million impact from the NNS contract, our transportation revenues increased 61.2 million, primarily due to re-contracting at higher rates and recently completed growth projects; our storage, parking and lending revenues increased 22.7 million due to favorable market conditions; our product sale revenues 
 19 

from the sale of natural gas, ethylene and propane increased by 22.8 million; and the Bayou Ethane acquisition contributed 245.4 million of operating revenues, primarily resulting from ethane product sales. 
 
 Operating costs and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 242.6 million, or 33 , to 981.4 million compared to 738.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our operating expenses were primarily impacted by the Bayou Ethane acquisition, which added an additional 233.9 million of operating costs, including 205.4 million of costs associated with product sales and 8.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense. 
 
 Our depreciation and amortization expense and interest income and expense were impacted by the following items: 
 
 higher depreciation and amortization expense of 14.8 million from an increased asset base from recently completed growth projects and the Bayou Ethane acquisition; and 
 higher interest expense of 20.3 million due to pre-financing the 600.0 million debt maturing in December 2024 and higher interest income of 10.5 million due to income earned from cash invested in short-term investments. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 In February 2024, we issued 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of Boardwalk Pipelines, LP (Boardwalk Pipelines) 5.625 notes due August 2034. In the first nine months of 2024, we paid a total of 150.0 million of distributions to Boardwalk GP, LP and Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp . We anticipate that our existing capital resources, including our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, revolving credit facility and our cash flows from operating activities, will be adequate to fund our operations and capital expenditures for 2024 and to retire our 600.0 million of debt that is maturing in December 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we also have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which we may publicly issue up to 900.0 million of debt securities, warrants or rights from time to time. 
 
 Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries 
 
 Our debt is primarily issued at Boardwalk Pipelines, our wholly owned subsidiary, although we have historically also issued debt at our operating subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, all of the outstanding notes issued by Boardwalk Pipelines (Subsidiary Issuer) and the full amount of the revolving credit facility, were guaranteed by us (Parent Guarantor). The purpose of the guarantees is to help simplify our reporting and capital structure. 
 
 We guarantee amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility, but any amounts borrowed are not subject to the reporting requirements of Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X (Rule 13-01). As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The following table identifies our principal amounts outstanding for the debt that is subject to the disclosure rules of Rule 13-01 (in millions): 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 Principal amounts guaranteed by Boardwalk Pipeline Partners and subject to Rule 13-01 (1) 
 3,750.0 Principal amounts not guaranteed (2) 
 100.0 Other (3) 
 (16.6) Total debt and finance lease obligation 3,833.4 
 
 (1) This represents principal amounts of all outstanding debt at Boardwalk Pipelines subject to the disclosure rules of Rule 13-01 (the Guaranteed Notes), including 600.0 million of outstanding principal amounts that has been classified as current. 
 (2) This represents principal amounts of outstanding debt at Texas Gas Transmission, LLC. 
 (3) This represents amounts related to a finance lease and unamortized debt discount and issuance costs. 
 
 The Guaranteed Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor on a senior unsecured basis. The guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes rank equally with all of our existing and future senior debt, including our guarantee of indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. The guarantees will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of 
 20 

our future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. There are no restrictions on the Subsidiary Issuer's ability to pay dividends or make loans to the Parent Guarantor. The guaranteed obligations will be terminated with respect to any series of notes if that series has been discharged or defeased. 
 
 Our operating assets, operating liabilities, operating revenues, expenses and other comprehensive income either exist at or are generated by our operating subsidiaries. The Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Issuer have no material assets, liabilities or operations independent of their respective financing activities, including the Guaranteed Notes and advances to and from each other, and their investments in the operating subsidiaries. For these reasons, we meet the criteria in Rule 13-01 to omit the summarized financial information from our disclosures. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Maintenance capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 122.2 million and 95.2 million. Growth capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 169.7 million and 136.7 million. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 Our principal payments associated with our outstanding debt obligations as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were 3.9 billion and 3.3 billion. Refer to Note 7 in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 12 in Part II, Item 8. of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our financing activities and debt obligations. 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
 
 Certain amounts included in or affecting our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring us to make certain judgments and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We review our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with third parties and other methods we consider reasonable. Nevertheless, actual results may differ materially from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the periods in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known. 
 
 During 2024, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies, judgments or estimates disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as some statements in our other filings with the SEC and periodic press releases and some statements made by our officials and our subsidiaries during presentations about us, are "forward-looking." Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may project, indicate or imply future results, events, performance, intentions or achievements, and may contain the words "expect," "intend," "plan," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "will likely result" and similar expressions. In addition, any statement concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible actions by us or our subsidiaries, are also forward-looking statements. 
 
 Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and their potential impact on us. While management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, there is no assurance that future events affecting us will be those that we anticipate. All forward-looking statements are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected. These include, among others, the impacts of legislative and regulatory initiatives, or the implementation thereof, the impacts of climate change, environmental, social and governance matters and pipeline safety requirements and initiatives, the costs of maintaining and ensuring the integrity and reliability of our pipeline systems, our ability to complete growth projects that we have commenced or will commence, the risk of a failure in computer systems or cybersecurity attack, successful negotiation, consummation and completion of contemplated transactions, projects and agreements, risks and uncertainties related to the impacts of volatility in energy prices and our exposure to credit risk relating to default or bankruptcy by our customers. Developments in any of these areas could cause our results to differ materially from results that have been or may be anticipated or projected. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made 
 21 

and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update these statements to reflect any change in our expectations or beliefs or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based. 
 
 Refer to Part I, Item 1A. of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional risks and uncertainties regarding our forward-looking statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Refer to Part II, Item 7A. of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of our market risk. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected or that are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
