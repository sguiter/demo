EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Report") combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, of Regency Centers Corporation and Regency Centers, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to "Regency Centers Corporation" or the "Parent Company" mean Regency Centers Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries and references to "Regency Centers, L.P." or the "Operating Partnership" mean Regency Centers, L.P. and its controlled subsidiaries. The terms "the Company," "Regency Centers," "Regency," "we," "our," and "us" as used in this Report mean the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, collectively. 
 The Parent Company is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") and the general partner of the Operating Partnership. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management. The Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common partnership units ("Common Units"). As of September 30, 2024, the Parent Company owned approximately 99.4 of the Common Units in the Operating Partnership. The remaining Common Units, which are all limited Common Units, are owned by third party investors. In addition to the Common Units, the Operating Partnership has also issued two series of preferred units: the 6.250 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the "Series A Preferred Units") and the 5.875 Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the "Series B Preferred Units"). The Parent Company currently owns all of the Series A Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units. The Series A Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units are sometimes referred to collectively as the "Preferred Units." 
 The Company believes combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits: 
 	 
 Enhances investors' understanding of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 

Eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation; and 

Creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 

Management operates the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of the Parent Company consists of the same individuals as the management of the Operating Partnership. These individuals are officers of the Parent Company, and officers and employees of the Operating Partnership. 
 The Company believes it is important to understand the key differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. The Parent Company is a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of Common and Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership. As a result, the Parent Company does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership. Except for 200 million of unsecured private placement debt, the Parent Company does not hold any indebtedness, but guarantees all of the unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, is also the co-issuer and guarantor of the 200 million Parent Company s unsecured private placement debt referenced above. The Operating Partnership holds all the assets of the Company and ownership of the Company's subsidiaries and equity interests in its joint ventures. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by the Parent Company, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for Common Units or Preferred Units, the Operating Partnership generates all other capital required by the Company's business. These sources include the Operating Partnership's operations, its direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of Common Units and Preferred Units. 
 Shareholders' equity, partners' capital, and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent Company and those of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership's capital includes the Common Units and the Preferred Units. The limited partners' Common Units in the Operating Partnership owned by third parties are accounted for in partners' capital in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and outside of shareholders' equity in noncontrolling interests in the Parent Company's financial statements. The Preferred Units owned by the Parent Company are eliminated in consolidation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company and are classified as preferred units of the general partner in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership. 
 In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, there are sections in this Report that separately discuss the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, including separate financial statements, controls and procedures sections, and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine disclosure for the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this Report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company. 
 As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, while shareholders' equity and partners' capital differ as discussed above, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.

 properties through real estate partnerships, of which are consolidated. Regency's partners include institutional investors, real estate developers and/or operators, and passive investors (the "Partners" or "Limited Partners"). These partnerships have been established to own and operate real estate properties. The Company s involvement with these entities is through its ownership and management of the properties. The entities were deemed VIEs primarily because the unrelated investors do not have substantive kick-out rights to remove the general or managing partner by a vote of a simple majority or less, and they do not have substantive participating rights. Regency has variable interests in these entities through its equity ownership, with Regency being the primary beneficiary in certain of these real estate partnerships. Regency consolidates the partnerships into its financial statements for which it is the primary beneficiary and reports the limited partners' interests as noncontrolling interests. For those partnerships which Regency is not the primary beneficiary and does not have a controlling financial interest, but has significant influence, Regency recognizes its equity investments in them in accordance with the equity method of accounting. The assets of these partnerships are restricted to use by the respective partnerships and cannot be directly reached by general creditors of the Company. Similarly, the obligations of the partnerships are backed by, and can only be settled through the assets of these partnerships or by additional capital contributions by the partners.

The above fair values represent management's estimate of the amounts that would be received from selling those assets or that would be paid to transfer those liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. These fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs which are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company's own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company develops its judgments based on the best information available at the measurement date, including expected cash flows, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates, and available observable and unobservable inputs. Service providers involved in fair value measurements are evaluated for competency and qualifications on an ongoing basis. As considerable judgment is often necessary to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments, the fair values presented above are not necessarily indicative of amounts that will be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments. (b) Recurring Fair Value The following financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: Securities The Company has investments in marketable securities that are included within Other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain statements in this document regarding anticipated financial, business, legal or other outcomes including business and market conditions, outlook and other similar statements relating to Regency's future events, developments, or financial or operational performance or results, are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "would," "expect," "estimate," "believe," "intend," "forecast," "project," "plan," "anticipate," "guidance," and other similar language. However, the absence of these or similar words or expressions does not mean a statement is not forward-looking. While we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance these expectations will be attained, and it is possible actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. 
 Our operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, risk factors described in our Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings, which include our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 ("2023 Form 10-K") under Item 1A. "Risk Factors" and in Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in this Report. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in our most recent 2023 Form 10-K, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our other filings with and submissions to the SEC. If any of the events described in the risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected. Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and Regency undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise, except as and to the extent required by law. 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 In addition to the required Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") presentations, we use and report certain non-GAAP measures as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operational results. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes. We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change. 
 We do not consider non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management's judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided. Non-GAAP measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects of the Company. 
 Defined Terms 
 The following terms, as defined, are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results, and are included in this document: 
 Adjusted Funds From Operations ("AFFO") is an additional performance measure we use that reflects cash available to fund the Company s business needs and distribution to shareholders. AFFO is calculated by adjusting Core Operating Earnings ("COE") for (i) capital expenditures necessary to maintain and lease our portfolio of properties, (ii) debt cost and derivative adjustments and (iii) stock-based compensation. 

Core Operating Earnings is an additional performance measure we use because the computation of National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Funds from Operations (" Nareit FFO ") includes certain non-comparable items that affect our period-over-period performance. Core Operating Earnings excludes from Nareit FFO: (i) transaction related income or expenses, (ii) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt, (iii) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from straight-line rents, above and below market rent amortization, and debt and derivative mark-to-market amortization, and (iv) other amounts as they occur. We provide reconciliations of both Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders to Nareit FFO and Nareit FFO to Core Operating Earnings. 

27 

Development Completion is a Property in Development that is deemed complete upon the earlier of: (i) 90 of total estimated net development costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95 , or (ii) the property features at least two years of anchor operations. Once deemed complete, the property is termed a Retail Operating Property. 

Nareit Funds from Operations ("Nareit FFO") is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which Nareit defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains on sales and impairments of real estate, net of tax, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We compute Nareit FFO for all periods presented in accordance with Nareit's definition. 

Companies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions. Since Nareit FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sale and impairments of real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, Nareit FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations. We provide a reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders to Nareit FFO. 	 
 Net Operating Income ("NOI") is the sum of base rent, percentage rent, recoveries from tenants, other lease income, and other property income, less operating and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes, ground rent, and uncollectible lease income. NOI excludes straight-line rental income and expense, above and below market rent and ground rent amortization, tenant lease inducement amortization, and other fees. We also provide disclosure of NOI excluding termination fees, which excludes both termination fee income and expenses. 

A Non-Same Property is any property, during either calendar year period being compared, that was acquired, sold, a Property in Development, a Development Completion, or a property under, or being positioned for, significant redevelopment that distorts comparability between periods. Non-retail properties and corporate activities, including the captive insurance program, are part of Non-Same Property. 

Pro-rata information includes 100 of our consolidated properties plus our economic share (based on our ownership interest) in our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships. 

We provide Pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships, when read in conjunction with our reported results under GAAP. We believe presenting our Pro-rata share of assets, liabilities, operating results, and other metrics, along with certain other non-GAAP measures, makes comparisons of our operating results to those of other REITs more meaningful. The Pro-rata information provided is not, nor is it intended to be, presented in accordance with GAAP. The Pro-rata supplemental details of assets and liabilities and supplemental details of operations reflect our proportionate economic ownership of the assets, liabilities, and operating results of the properties in our portfolio. 
 The Pro-rata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the assets, liabilities, and operating results of properties in our portfolio. We do not control the unconsolidated real estate partnerships, and the Pro-rata presentations of the assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items. The partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements, which generally provide for such allocations according to their invested capital. Our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our Pro-rata share. 
 The presentation of Pro-rata information has limitations which include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 o The amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses; and 

o Other companies in our industry may calculate their Pro-rata interest differently, limiting the comparability of Pro-rata information. 

Because of these limitations, the Pro-rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP financial statements, using the Pro-rata information as a supplement. 
 Property In Development includes properties in various stages of ground-up development. 

Property In Redevelopment includes Retail Operating Properties under redevelopment or being positioned for redevelopment. Unless otherwise indicated, a Property in Redevelopment is included in the Same Property pool. 

Redevelopment Completion is a Property in Redevelopment that is deemed complete upon the earlier of: (i) 90 of total estimated project costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95 for the Company owned GLA related to the project, or (ii) the property features at least two years of anchor operations, if applicable. 

28 

Retail Operating Property is any retail property not termed a Property in Development. A retail property is any property where the majority of the income is generated from retail uses. 

Same Property is a Retail Operating Property that was owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar year periods being compared. This term excludes Properties in Development, prior year Development Completions, and Non-Same Properties. Properties in Redevelopment are included unless otherwise indicated. 

Overview of Our Strategy 
 Regency Centers Corporation began operations as a publicly-traded REIT in 1993. All of our operating, investing, and financing activities are performed through our Operating Partnership, Regency Centers, L.P. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and through our real estate partnerships. As of September 30, 2024, the Parent Company owned approximately 99.4 of the outstanding Common Units and 100 of the Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership. 
 We are a preeminent national owner, operator, and developer of neighborhood and community shopping centers predominantly located in suburban trade areas with compelling demographics. As of September 30, 2024, we had full or partial ownership interests in 483 retail properties. Our properties are high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers primarily anchored by market leading grocers and principally located in suburban markets within the country's most desirable metro areas, and contain approximately 57.2 million square feet ("SF") of gross leasable area ("GLA"). Our mission is to create thriving environments for retailers and service providers to connect with surrounding neighborhoods and communities. Our vision is to elevate quality of life as an integral thread in the fabric of our communities. Our portfolio includes thriving properties merchandised with highly productive grocers, restaurants, service providers, and best-in-class retailers that connect with their neighborhoods, communities, and customers. 
 Our values: 
 We are our people: Our people are our greatest asset, and we believe that a talented team from diverse backgrounds and experiences makes us better. 

We do what is right: We act with unwavering standards of honesty and integrity. 

We connect with our communities: We promote philanthropic ideas and strive for the betterment of our neighborhoods by giving our time and financial support. 

We are responsible: Our duty is to balance purpose and profit, being good stewards of capital and the environment for the benefit of all our stakeholders. 

We strive for excellence: When we are passionate about what we do, it is reflected in our performance. 

We are better together: When we listen to each other and our customers, we will succeed together. 

Our goals are to: 
 Own and manage a portfolio of high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers anchored primarily by market leading grocers and principally located in suburban trade areas in the most desirable metro areas in the United States. We believe that this strategy will result in highly desirable and attractive centers with best-in-class retailers. These centers should command higher rental and occupancy rates resulting in excellent prospects to grow NOI; 

Create shareholder value by increasing earnings and dividends per share that generate total returns at or near the top of our shopping center peers; 

Maintain an industry leading, disciplined development and redevelopment platform to create exceptional retail centers that deliver favorable returns; 

Support our business activities with a conservative capital structure, including a strong balance sheet with sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs together with a carefully constructed debt maturity profile; 

Implement leading environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") practices through our Corporate Responsibility program to support and enhance our business goals and objectives; and 

Engage and retain an exceptional and diverse team that is guided by our strong values, while fostering an environment of innovation and continuous improvement. 

Executing on our Strategy 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had Net income attributable to common shareholders of 303.7 million as compared to 273.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 29 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Our Pro-rata same property NOI, excluding termination fees, grew 2.9 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to improvements in base rent from increases in year over year occupancy rates, contractual rent steps in existing leases, and positive rent spreads on comparable new and renewal leases. 

We executed 1,503 new and renewal leasing transactions representing 6.3 million Pro-rata SF with positive rent spreads of 9.0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,310 leasing transactions representing 4.8 million Pro-rata SF with positive rent spreads of 9.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Rent spreads are calculated on all executed leasing transactions for comparable Retail Operating Property spaces, including spaces vacant greater than 12 months. 

At September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023 our total property portfolio was 95.6 , 95.1 , and 94.6 leased, respectively. At September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023 our same property portfolio was 96.1 , 95.7 , and 95.3 leased, respectively. 

We continued our development and redevelopment of high quality shopping centers: 
 Estimated Pro-rata project costs of our current in process development and redevelopment projects totaled 618.3 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 468.1 million at December 31, 2023. 

Development and redevelopment projects completed during 2024 represented 31.3 million of estimated net project costs, with an average stabilized yield of 7.6 . 

We maintained liquidity and financial flexibility to cost effectively fund investment opportunities and debt maturities: 
 We received a credit rating upgrade to A3 with a stable outlook from Moody's Investors Service. 

On January 8, 2024, we priced a public offering of 400 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2034, with a coupon of 5.25 . We used a portion of the net proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance on the Line and invested the remaining net proceeds in certificates of deposit and short-term U.S. Treasury mutual funds until required for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding debt, as further described below. 

On June 17, 2024, we repaid 250 million of maturing senior unsecured notes. 

On August 12, 2024, we priced a public offering of 325 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2035, with a coupon of 5.1 . We used the net proceeds from this offering to reduce the outstanding balance on the Line. 

We have 103.5 million of secured loans maturing during the next 12 months, including Regency's pro-rata share of maturities within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships, which we intend to refinance or pay-off as they mature. 

At September 30, 2024, we had 1.46 billion available on the Line, which expires on March 23, 2028 unless we exercise the available options to extend the maturity for two additional six-month periods, in which case the term will be extended in accordance with any such option exercise.

(2) In October 2022, Kroger Co. and Albertsons Companies, Inc. announced a proposed merger, and in September 2023 an agreement for a separate transaction was announced to divest certain assets of each company to a third party, C S Wholesale Grocers ("C S"). The transaction with C S, as later amended in April 2024, calls for the sale of 579 stores to C S. Lawsuits have been filed by federal and state regulators to enjoin the merger on antitrust grounds. Regency has a combined 104 Kroger and Albertson's stores, and 11 of them are among the 579 locations proposed to be sold to C S. These 11 locations comprise 0.9 of GLA and 0.5 of Annual Base Rent, including our Pro-rata share of our real estate partnerships . The expected outcome of the lawsuits to enjoin the transactions is uncertain at this time. Based on information currently available to the Company, we do not believe that these transactions (if they are consummated), or the termination of these transactions (if they are legally enjoined or otherwise fail to close), will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or the financial condition of the Company. 

Bankruptcies and Credit Concerns 
 Our management team devotes significant time to researching and monitoring consumer preferences and trends, customer shopping behaviors, changes in delivery methods, shifts to e-commerce, and changing demographics in order to anticipate the challenges and opportunities impacting our industry. We seek to mitigate these potential impacts through maintaining a high quality portfolio, diversifying our tenant mix, replacing less successful tenants with stronger operators, anchoring our centers with market leading grocers that drive customer traffic, and investing in suburban trade areas with compelling demographic populations benefiting from high levels of disposal income. The potential for a recession and the severity and duration of any economic downturn could negatively impact our existing tenants and their ability to continue to meet their lease obligations. 
 Although base rent is derived from long-term lease contracts, tenants that file for bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. Any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims. As a result, in a tenant bankruptcy situation it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold. Additionally, we may incur significant expense to adjudicate our claim and significant downtime to re-lease the vacated space. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files for bankruptcy and rejects its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. At September 30, 2024, tenants currently in bankruptcy and which continue to occupy space in our shopping centers represent an aggregate of 0.3 of our Pro-rata annual base rent.

Total lease income increased by 28.1 million primarily due to the following: 
 19.2 million increase from billable Base rent, mainly from the following: 

o 12.9 million increase from the acquisition of UBP; 

o 5.1 million net increase from same properties, including: 

3.6 million net increase due to increases from occupancy, rent steps in existing leases, and positive rental spreads on new and renewal leases; and 

1.5 million increase due to redevelopment projects becoming operational; 

o 2.1 million increase from acquisitions of operating properties; partially offset by 

o 1.4 million decrease from disposition of properties. 

7.8 million increase from contractual Recoveries from tenants, which represents the tenants' proportionate share of the operating, maintenance, insurance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers. Recoveries from tenants increased, mainly from the following: 

o 5.5 million increase from the acquisition of UBP; and 

o 2.0 million increase from same properties primarily due to higher expense recovery rates in the current year. 

2.5 million increase in Straight-line rent mainly due to timing and degree of contractual rent steps.. 

2.4 million decrease in Above and below market rent and tenant rent inducement amortization, net primarily due to: 

o 3.2 million decrease from same properties driven by an accelerated amortization from an early tenant move-out in 2023; partially offset by 

o 0.8 million increase from the acquisition of UBP and other operating properties. 

Other property income of 1.8 million increased primarily due to an increase in business interruption proceeds received in 2024. 
 There were no significant changes in Management, transaction, and other fees.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized gains on sale of 11.4 million mainly from the sale of one operating property. 
 Net investment income increased by 2.4 million primarily driven by 1.7 million increase in gains on investments held in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which has an offsetting expense in General and administrative expenses noted above, and 0.7 million increase in gains on other corporate investments. 
 There were no significant changes in Equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships.

o 7.3 million increase primarily due to higher operating costs in the current year coupled with higher expense recovery rates; and 

o 1.0 million net increase driven by the acquisition of operating properties. 

1.7 million increase in Percentage rent due to increases in tenant sales. 

4.4 million change in Uncollectible lease income primarily driven by elevated collections in 2023 of previously reserved amounts, reducing our adjustment in the comparative period. 

2.0 million increase in Other lease income primarily due to: 

o 4.6 million increase driven by acquisition of UBP; partially offset by 

o 2.6 million decrease mainly due to lease termination fee income recognized in the comparative period. 

6.7 million increase in Straight-line rent mainly due to: 

o 3.3 million increase from the acquisition of UBP; 

o 3.4 million due to timing and degree of contractual rent steps within same properties and development properties. 

3.7 million decrease in Above and below market rent and tenant rent inducement amortization, net primarily due to: 

o 6.6 million decrease from same properties mainly driven by accelerated amortization from an early tenant move-out in 2023; partially offset by 

o 2.9 million increase from the acquisition of UBP and other operating properties. 

Other property income increased by 3.0 million primarily due to business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2024.

 Supplemental Earnings Information 
 We use certain non-GAAP measures, in addition to certain performance metrics determined under GAAP, as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the operating results. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes. We provide Pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, when read in conjunction with our reported results under GAAP. We believe presenting our Pro-rata share of operating results, along with other non-GAAP measures, may assist in comparing our operating results to other REITs. We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported non-GAAP measures could change. See "Non-GAAP Measures" at the beginning of this Management's Discussion and Analysis.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 We use cash flows generated from operating, investing, and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet, finance our development and redevelopment projects, fund our investment activities, and maintain financial flexibility. A significant portion of our cash from operations is distributed to our common shareholders in the form of dividends in order to maintain our status as a REIT. 
 Except for 200 million of private placement debt, our Parent Company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our Operating Partnership. All remaining debt is held by our Operating Partnership, its subsidiaries, or by our real estate partnerships. The Operating Partnership is a co-issuer and a guarantor of the 200 million of outstanding debt of our Parent Company. The Parent Company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity, and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional partnership units. 
 We continually assess our available liquidity and our expected cash requirements, including monitoring our tenant rent collections. We have access to and draw on multiple financing sources to fund our operations and our long-term capital needs, including the requirements of our in process and planned developments, redevelopments, other capital expenditures, and the repayment of debt. We expect to meet these needs by using a combination of the following: cash flow from operations after funding our common stock and preferred stock dividends, borrowings from our Line, proceeds from the sale of real estate, mortgage loan and unsecured bank financing, distributions received from our real estate partnerships, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of equity securities or the issuance of new unsecured debt. We continually evaluate alternative financing options, and we believe we can obtain new financing on reasonable terms, although likely at higher interest rates than that of our debt currently outstanding, due to the current interest rate environment.

On January 8, 2024, we priced a public offering of 400 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2034 (the "January 2024 Notes") under our existing shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The January 2024 Notes were issued at 99.617 of par value with a coupon of 5.25 , and will mature on January 15, 2034. Additionally, on August 12, 2024, we priced a public offering of 325 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2035 (the "August 2024 Notes") under our existing shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The August 2024 Notes were issued at 99.813 of par value with a coupon of 5.10 , and will mature on January 15, 2035. 
 We redeemed 250 million of senior unsecured notes that matured in June 2024, and our next maturity of senior unsecured notes occurs in November 2025. We have 103.5 million of secured loan maturities during the next 12 months, including Regency's pro-rata share of maturities within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships, which we intend to refinance or pay off as they mature. Based upon our available cash balance, sources of capital, our current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties we own, we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs for the next year, although, in the longer term, we can provide no assurances. 
 In addition to our 110.0 million of unrestricted cash, we have the following additional sources of capital available:

(2) The Company has the option to extend the maturity for two additional six-month periods. 

The declaration of dividends is determined quarterly by, and in the discretion of, our Board of Directors ("Board"). We expect to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders, that at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
 We have historically generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our dividend distributions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated cash flows from operating activities of 598.8 million and 547.7 million, respectively, and paid 381.5 million in dividends to our common and preferred stock and unit holders, and 334.3 million in dividends to our common stock and unit holders, in the same respective periods. 
 We currently have development and redevelopment projects in various stages of planning, design and construction, along with a pipeline of potential projects for future development or redevelopment. After funding our common and preferred stock dividend payments in October of 2024, we estimate that we will require capital during the next 12 months of approximately 460.7 million related to leasing commissions, tenant improvements, in-process developments and redevelopments, capital contributions to our real estate partnerships, and repaying maturing debt. These capital requirements are being impacted by inflation resulting in increased costs of construction materials, labor, and services from third-party contractors and suppliers. In response, we have implemented mitigation strategies such as entering into fixed cost construction contracts, pre-ordering materials, and other planning efforts. Further, continued challenges from permitting delays and labor shortages may extend the time to completion of these projects. 
 If we start new developments or redevelopments, commit to property acquisitions, repay debt prior to maturity, declare future dividends, or repurchase shares of our common stock, our cash requirements will increase. If we refinance maturing debt, our cash requirements will decrease. 
 We endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets. As of September 30, 2024, 88.1 of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered. Our low level of encumbered assets allows us to more readily access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain borrowing capacity on the Line. 
 Our Line and unsecured debt require that we remain in compliance with various customary financial covenants, which are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K. We were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2024, and expect to remain in compliance.

Significant changes in investing activities include: 
 We paid 45.2 million in 2024 to purchase one operating property. 

During 2023, we invested 80.5 million, net of 14.1 million in cash acquired, for the acquisition of UBP, including 39.3 million for UBP debt repaid at closing, and 55.3 million in direct transaction and other costs. 

During 2024, we invested 76.3 million more on real estate development, redevelopment, and capital improvements, as further detailed in a table below. 

We sold four operating properties in 2024 for proceeds of 103.6 million compared to three land parcels in 2023 for proceeds of 10.3 million. 

We received additional property insurance claim proceeds of 5.3 million in 2024 primarily attributable to a single property that was impacted by a weather event in 2019. 

During 2024, in connection with a secured lending transaction entered into by the Company, we issued a note receivable in the amount of 29.8 million at an interest rate of 6.9 maturing in January 2027, secured by a grocery-anchored shopping center. In addition, we issued 2.9 million short-term notes receivable to real estate partners in 2024, as compared to the issuance of a 4.0 million in 2023. 

We collected 3.0 million in short-term note receivables from real estate partners in 2024. 

42 

Investments in real estate partnerships: 

o In 2024, we invested 25.8 million to fund our share of development and redevelopment activities, including investing in two new ground up development projects. 

o In 2023, we invested 9.1 million, including 2.8 million to fund our share of acquiring one operating property within an existing real estate partnership, and 6.3 million to fund our share of development and redevelopment activities. 

Return of capital from our unconsolidated investments in real estate partnerships includes sales or financing proceeds. 

o During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we received 12.9 million from our share of proceeds from debt financing activities and for the partial sale of ownership interest in a real estate partnership. 

o During the same period in 2023, we received 3.6 million from our share of proceeds from debt financing activities. 

Acquisition of securities and proceeds from sale of securities pertain to investment activities held in our captive insurance company and our deferred compensation plan. Additionally, we invested approximately 90 million in commercial deposits from the proceeds received from the January 2024 public offering of senior unsecured notes. The commercial deposits were subsequently settled at maturity during the second quarter of 2024. 

We plan to continue developing and redeveloping shopping centers for long-term investment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we deployed capital of 235.3 million for the development, redevelopment, and improvement of our real estate properties, comprised of the following:

We acquired three land parcels for development, and two outparcels in 2024, compared to one land parcel for development in 2023. 

Building and tenant improvements increased 17.5 million in 2024, primarily related to the timing and volume of capital projects. 

Redevelopment costs are higher than prior year. We intend to continuously improve our portfolio of shopping centers through redevelopment which can include adjacent land acquisition, existing building expansion, facade renovation, new out-parcel building construction, and redevelopment related tenant improvement costs. The size and magnitude of each redevelopment project varies with each redevelopment plan. The timing and duration of these projects could also result in volatility in NOI. See the tables below for more details about our redevelopment projects. 

Development costs are higher in 2024 due to the progress towards completion of our development projects in process. See the tables below for more details about our development projects. 

Interest is capitalized on our development and redevelopment projects and is based on cumulative actual costs expended. We cease interest capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor tenant opens for business. If we reduce our development and redevelopment activity, the amount of interest that we capitalize may be lower than historical averages. 

We have a staff of employees who directly support our development program, which includes redevelopment of our existing properties. Internal compensation costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized as part of each project.

(1) Reflects scheduled principal payments and maturities for the remainder of the year. 

At September 30, 2024, our investments in real estate partnerships had notes payable of 1.6 billion maturing through 2034, of which 93.4 had a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.9 . The remaining notes payable float with SOFR and had a weighted average variable interest rate of 7.3 , based on rates as of September 30, 2024. These fixed and variable rate notes payable are all non-recourse, and our Pro-rata share was 571.8 million as of September 30, 2024. As notes payable mature, they are expected to be repaid from proceeds from new borrowings and/or partner capital contributions. Refinancing debt at maturity in the current interest rate environment could result in higher interest expense in future periods if rates remain elevated. 
 We believe that our partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements. In the event that a real estate investment partner is unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the real estate partnership, we would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call which would be secured by the partner's membership interest.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There have been no material changes in our Critical Accounting Estimates from the information provided in the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section of "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Form 10-K. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk: 
 Under the Line, we have a variable interest rate that, as of September 30, 2024, was based upon an annual rate of SOFR plus a 0.10 market adjustment ("Adjusted SOFR") plus an applicable margin of 0.715 . SOFR rates charged on our Line change monthly, and the applicable margin on the Line is dependent upon the Company's maintenance of specific credit ratings and leverage parameters. 

We are also exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows. To mitigate that risk, we generally borrow with fixed rate debt and we may use derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on our variable rate debt. 

The table below presents the principal cash flows, weighted average interest rates of remaining debt, and the fair value of total debt as of September 30, 2024. For variable rate mortgages and unsecured credit facilities for which we have interest rate swaps in place to fix the interest rate, they are included in the Fixed rate debt section below at their all-in fixed rate. The table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes. Although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table, those rates represent rates that existed as of September 30, 2024, and are subject to change. In addition, we continually assess the market risk for floating rate debt and believe that an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 0.3 million per year based on 33.8 million of floating rate mortgage debt and floating rate line of credit balances outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 Further, the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of September 30, 2024, and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date or obligations repaid before maturity. Since firm commitments are not presented, the table has limited predictive value. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time, and actual interest rates. 
 The table below presents the principal cash flow payments associated with our outstanding debt by year, weighted average interest rates on debt outstanding at each year-end, and fair value of total debt as of September 30, 2024.
