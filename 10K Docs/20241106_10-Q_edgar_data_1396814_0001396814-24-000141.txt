 Performance Obligations 
 A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606. A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. 
 At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a good that is distinct. When identifying individual performance obligations, the Company considers all goods promised in the contract regardless of whether explicitly stated in the customer contract or implied by customary business practices. The Company s contracts with customers require it to transfer an individual distinct product, which represents a single performance obligation. The Company s performance obligation with respect to its product sales is satisfied at a point in time, which transfers control upon delivery of EXPAREL and ZILRETTA to its customers. The Company considers control to have transferred upon delivery because the customer has legal title to the asset, physical possession of the asset has been transferred, the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and the Company has a present right to payment at that time.

 (1) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company disposed million of fully depreciated machinery and equipment associated with its 45-liter EXPAREL manufacturing process at its contract manufacturing facility located in Swindon, England. The Company continues to operate its 200-liter EXPAREL manufacturing process at the same facility. 
 (2) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 200-liter EXPAREL manufacturing suite at the Company s Science Center Campus in San Diego, California was placed into service, for which approximately million was reclassified from construction in progress to machinery and equipment, leasehold improvements and computer equipment and software. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation expense was million and million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was million and million of capitalized interest on the construction of manufacturing sites, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation expense was million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was million and million of capitalized interest on the construction of manufacturing sites, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total fixed assets, net, includes manufacturing process equipment and leasehold improvements located in Europe in the amount of million and million, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had asset retirement obligations of million and million, respectively, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on its condensed consolidated balance sheets, for costs associated with returning leased spaces to their original condition upon the termination of certain of its lease agreements. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved a generic competitor to EXPAREL and a U.S. District Court ruled that one of the Company s patents was not valid (for more information, see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies ). The Company determined that these events and a subsequent decrease in the Company s common stock price constituted impairment indicators under ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment . As of September 30, 2024, the Company performed a quantitative recoverability test of the carrying values of its asset group. The Company estimated the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these asset groups and found that impairment charge to long-lived assets was necessary.

 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination and is subject to impairment testing at least annually or upon the occurrence of a triggering event that could indicate a potential impairment. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the FDA approved a generic competitor to EXPAREL and a U.S. District Court ruled that one of the Company s patents was not valid (for more information, see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies ). The Company determined that these events, combined with a subsequent decrease in the Company s common stock price, indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill may be less than its carrying value, which required the Company to perform a quantitative impairment test. This was performed by comparing the fair value of the Company with its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge up to the carrying value of goodwill. The fair value of the Company was calculated through an income approach, in which the Company calculated the fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to assume fair value. The Company s estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions, internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and future margins. Additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated discount rates and the probability of success for the Company s product pipeline candidate products. The assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. The conclusion of the income approach as of September, 30, 2024 resulted in the carrying value of the Company exceeding its fair value by more than the goodwill balance. As a result, the goodwill balance of million was fully impaired during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As detailed further in Note 5, Fixed Assets , certain events during the three months ended September 30, 2024 constituted impairment indicators under ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment . As of September 30, 2024, the Company performed a quantitative recoverability test of the carrying values of its asset group. The Company estimated the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these asset groups and found that impairment charge to long-lived assets was necessary. Intangible assets were included within the assessed long-lived assets.

 Holders may convert the 2029 Notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding November 15, 2028, only if certain circumstances are met, including, but not limited to, if during the previous calendar quarter, the last reported sales price of the Company s common stock was greater than of the conversion price then applicable for at least out of the last consecutive trading days of the quarter. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the conditions for conversion were not met. 
 On or after November 15, 2028, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2029, holders may convert their 2029 Notes at any time. 
 Upon conversion, holders will receive the principal amount of their 2029 Notes and any excess conversion value, calculated based on the per share volume-weighted average price for each of the consecutive trading days during the observation period (as more fully described in the 2029 Indenture). For the principal, the Company will settle in cash per the terms of the 2029 Notes. For any excess conversion value, holders may receive cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock, at the Company s option. The initial conversion rate for the

 per share of the Company s common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. The initial conversion price of the 2029 Notes represents a premium of approximately to the closing sale price of per share of the Company s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 9, 2024, the date that the Company priced the private offering of the 2029 Notes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the 2029 Notes had a market price of 757 per 1,000 principal amount. In the event of conversion, holders would forgo all future interest payments, any unpaid accrued interest and the possibility of further stock price appreciation. Upon the receipt of conversion requests, the settlement of the 2029 Notes will be paid pursuant to the terms of the 2029 Indenture. In the event that all of the 2029 Notes are converted, the Company would be required to repay the million in principal value in cash, whereas any conversion premium would be required to be repaid in any combination of cash and shares of its common stock (at the Company s option). 
 Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding November 15, 2028, the 2029 Notes are convertible only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2024 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Common Stock for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is equal to or greater than of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the business-day period after any consecutive trading-day period (the measurement period in which the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events; or (4) upon a Company redemption. On or after November 15, 2028, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2029, holders of the 2029 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2029 Notes, at any time. Upon conversion, the 2029 Notes will be settled by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock, based on the applicable conversion rate. No sinking fund is provided for the 2029 Notes. 
 On or after May 17, 2027 and on or before the th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the 2029 Notes if (i) the 2029 Notes are freely tradable (as defined in the 2029 Indenture) and any accrued and unpaid additional interest has been paid as of the date the Company sends the related notice of the redemption and (ii) the last reported sales price of the Company s common stock exceeds of the conversion price then in effect for (1) each of at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related notice of the redemption; and (2) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. The redemption price of each 2029 Note to be redeemed will be the principal amount of such 2029 Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, calling any 2029 Notes for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change, in which case the conversion rate applicable to those 2029 Notes, if converted in connection with the redemption, will be increased in certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2029 Indenture), subject to a limited exception for certain cash mergers, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their 2029 Notes for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 
 While the 2029 Notes are currently classified on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 as long-term debt, the future convertibility and resulting balance sheet classification of this liability is monitored at each quarterly reporting date and is analyzed dependent upon market prices of the Company s common stock during the prescribed measurement periods. In the event that the holders of the 2029 Notes have the election to convert the 2029 Notes at any time during the prescribed measurement period, the 2029 Notes would then be considered a current obligation and classified as such. 
 On May 9, 2024, in connection with the pricing of the 2029 Notes, and on May 10, 2024, in connection with the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of the 2029 Notes (the Initial Purchasers of their option to purchase additional 2029 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the Capped Call Transactions with certain of the Initial Purchasers of the 2029 Notes and/or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the Option Counterparties ). The Capped Call Transactions are expected to cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the 2029 Notes, the number of shares of the Company s common stock underlying the 2029 Notes. 
 The Capped Call Transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to the Company s common stock upon any conversion of the 2029 Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2029 Notes, as the case may be, upon any conversion of the 2029 Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions will initially be approximately per share, representing a premium of approximately over the closing price of per share of the Company s common stock on

 The Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions entered into by the Company with the Option Counterparties, are not part of the terms of the 2029 Notes and will not affect any holder s rights under the 2029 Notes. Holders of the 2029 Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Capped Call Transactions. 
 Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025 
 In July 2020, the Company completed a private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of its convertible senior notes due 2025, or 2025 Notes, and entered into an indenture with Computershare Corporate Trust, N.A.

The 2025 Notes accrue interest at a fixed rate of per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 st and August 1 st of each year. The 2025 Notes mature on August 1, 2025. 
 In May 2024, the Company used part of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes in privately negotiated transactions at a discount for million in cash (including accrued interest). The partial repurchase of the 2025 Notes resulted in a million gain on early extinguishment of debt.

 Upon conversion, holders will receive the principal amount of their 2025 Notes and any excess conversion value, calculated based on the per share volume-weighted average price for each of the consecutive trading days during the observation period (as more fully described in the 2025 Indenture). For both the principal and excess conversion value, holders may receive cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock, at the Company s option. The initial conversion rate for the 2025 Notes is 13.9324 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share of the Company s common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. The initial conversion price of the 2025 Notes represents a premium of approximately to the closing sale price of per share of the Company s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on July 7, 2020, the date that the Company priced the private offering of the 2025 Notes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the 2025 Notes had a market price o f 956 pe r 1,000 principal amount.

In addition, calling the 2025 Notes for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2025 Indenture) and will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of such notes if it is converted in connection with the redemption. No sinking fund is provided for the 2025 Notes. 
 Convertible Senior Notes Due 2024 Assumed from the Flexion Acquisition

 Acquisition-Related Contingent Consideration 
 The Company has recognized contingent consideration related to the Flexion Acquisition in the amount of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s contingent consideration obligations are recorded at their estimated fair values and are revalued each reporting period if and until the related contingencies are resolved. The Company has measured the fair value of its contingent consideration using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach that is based on unobservable inputs and a Monte Carlo simulation. These inputs include, as applicable, estimated probabilities and the timing of achieving specified commercial and regulatory milestones, estimated forecasts of revenue and costs and the discount rates used to calculate the present value of estimated future payments. Significant changes may increase or decrease the probabilities of achieving the related commercial and regulatory events, shorten or lengthen the time required to achieve such events, or increase or decrease estimated forecasts.

 million if certain regulatory and commercial milestones are met. The aggregate amount was initially million prior to the Company s September 2022 decision to formally discontinue further development of Flexion s investigational product candidate, PCRX-301. The Company s obligation to make milestone payments is limited to those milestones achieved through December 31, 2030, and are to be paid within days of the end of the fiscal quarter of achievement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized contingent consideration gains of million and million, respectively, due to adjustments reflecting the probability of achieving the remaining Flexion regulatory milestone by the milestone expiration date, partially offset by revisions to the latest discount rates. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 the Company recorded charges of million primarily due to market volatility which affects the liability s present value. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized gains of million due to adjustments to long-term forecasts which reduced the probability of meeting the sales-based contingent consideration milestones by December 31, 2030, the expiration date for achieving the milestones. The gains recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were partially offset by a decrease in the assumed discount rate that is utilized in calculating the liability s present value, based on a significant improvement in the Company s incremental borrowing rate resulting from the TLA Credit Agreement entered into in March 2023. These adjustments were recorded within contingent consideration (gains) charges, restructuring charges and other in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 eVenus Pharmaceutical Laboratories Litigations 
 In October 2021, the Company received a Notice Letter advising that eVenus Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Inc., or eVenus, of Princeton, New Jersey, submitted to the FDA an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification seeking authorization for the manufacturing and marketing of a generic version of EXPAREL (266 mg/20 mL) in the U.S. prior to the expiration of U.S. Patent No. 11,033,495 (the 495 patent). 
 In November 2021, the Company filed a patent infringement suit against eVenus and its parent company in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (21-cv-19829) asserting infringement of the 495 patent. This triggered an automatic 30-month stay of final approval of the eVenus ANDA which expired on July 1, 2024. On January 6, 2022, eVenus filed an Answer with counterclaims to the Complaint, alleging the 495 patent is invalid and/or not infringed through the manufacture, sale, or offer for sale of the product described in eVenus s ANDA submission. 
 In December 2021, the Company received a second Notice Letter advising that eVenus submitted to the FDA an amendment to its ANDA with a Paragraph IV Certification seeking authorization for the manufacturing and marketing of a generic version of EXPAREL (133 mg/10 mL) in the U.S. prior to the expiration of the 495 patent. In the second Notice Letter, eVenus also advised that it submitted a Paragraph IV Certification to the FDA seeking authorization for the manufacturing and marketing of a generic version of EXPAREL (266 mg/20 mL and 133 mg/10 mL) in the U.S. prior to the expiration of U.S. Patent No. 11,179,336 (the 336 patent). eVenus further alleges in the Notice Letter that both the 495 patent and the 336 patent are invalid and/or not infringed. 
 In February 2022, the Company filed a second patent infringement suit against eVenus and its parent company in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (22-cv-00718) asserting that the 133 mg/10 mL ANDA product will infringe the 495 and 336 patents and that the 266 mg/20 mL ANDA product will infringe the 336 patent. This filing triggered a second automatic 30-month stay of final approval for the 133 mg/10 mL ANDA product which expired on July 1, 2024. The first and second patent infringement suits were consolidated.

 Overview 
 Pacira s mission is to deliver innovative, non-opioid pain therapies to transform the lives of patients. Our long-acting, local analgesic EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) utilizes our unique pMVL drug delivery technology that encapsulates drugs without altering their molecular structure and releases them over a desired period of time. In the U.S., EXPAREL is a long-acting, non-opioid option proven to manage postsurgical pain. EXPAREL is the only product indicated for local analgesia via infiltration in patients aged six years and older and regional analgesia via interscalene brachial plexus nerve block, sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa and adductor canal block in adults. In Europe, EXPAREL is approved as a brachial plexus block or femoral nerve block for treatment of post-operative pain in adults, and as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults and children aged six years and older. Since its initial approval in 2011, more than 15 million patients have been treated with EXPAREL. We drop-ship EXPAREL directly to end-users based on orders placed to wholesalers or directly to us, and there is no product held by wholesalers. With the acquisition of Flexion Therapeutics, Inc., or Flexion, in November 2021 (the Flexion Acquisition ), we acquired ZILRETTA (triamcinolone acetonide extended-release injectable suspension), the first and only extended-release, intra-articular, or IA, injectable therapy that can provide major relief for osteoarthritis, or OA, knee pain for three months and has the potential to become an alternative to hyaluronic acid, platelet rich plasma injections or other early intervention treatments. With the acquisition of MyoScience, Inc., or MyoScience, in April 2019 (the MyoScience Acquisition , we acquired iovera , a handheld cryoanalgesia device used to deliver a precise, controlled application of cold temperature to targeted nerves, which we sell directly to end users. EXPAREL, ZILRETTA and iovera are highly complementary products as long-acting, non-opioid therapies that alleviate pain. We are also advancing the development of PCRX-201 (enekinragene inzadenovec), a novel, locally administered gene therapy with the potential to treat large prevalent diseases like OA. 
 We expect to continue to pursue the expanded use of EXPAREL, ZILRETTA and iovera in additional procedures; progress our earlier-stage product candidate pipeline; advance regulatory activities for EXPAREL, ZILRETTA, iovera , PCRX-201 and our other product candidates; invest in sales and marketing resources for EXPAREL, ZILRETTA and iovera expand and enhance our manufacturing capacity for EXPAREL, ZILRETTA and iovera invest in products, businesses and technologies; and support legal matters. 
 Global Economic Conditions 
 Direct and indirect effects of global economic conditions have in the past, and may continue to, negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such impacts may include the effect of prolonged periods of inflation which could, among other things, result in higher costs for labor, raw materials and services; cause patients to defer or cancel medical procedures, thereby adversely impacting our revenues; and negatively impact our suppliers which could result in longer lead-times or the inability to secure a sufficient supply of materials. The current macroeconomic environment remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material changes. Additional negative impacts may also arise that we are unable to foresee. The nature and extent of such impacts will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 
 
 Recent Highlights Developments 
 
 In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey issued its ruling in our patent infringement suit against eVenus Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Inc., or eVenus, and its parent company for infringement of EXPAREL U.S. Patent No. 11,033,495. The ruling found that this patent is not valid on the grounds of obviousness and anticipation. A notice of appeal was filed in September 2024 and remains pending. 
 We currently have four other patent infringement lawsuits pending against eVenus and its parent company and remain committed to vigorously defending our EXPAREL intellectual property for the benefit of our shareholders, patients and other stakeholders. With respect to an injunction, based on the information received through the ongoing court proceedings, we do not believe irreparable harm from an at-risk launch is imminent at this time. 
 For more information, see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein. 
 In September 2024, we announced the upcoming presentation of new 104-week safety and efficacy data following local administration of our gene therapy candidate PCRX-201 (enekinragene inzadenovec) for moderate to severe OA of the knee. The data will be presented at the American College of Rheumatology s annual ACR Convergence meeting, being held in Washington, D.C. November 14 19, 2024.

 In October 2024, we announced that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, has established a permanent product-specific Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) J-code for EXPAREL. The new J-code for EXPAREL J0666 becomes effective January 1, 2025, and will supersede the current C-code (C9290), which has been in place since 2019. In addition to the separate CMS reimbursement EXPAREL will receive in outpatient settings with the implementation of the NOPAIN Act in January 2025, this new J-code will also provide reimbursement when EXPAREL is used in the office setting and for office-based surgeries. 
 J-codes are reimbursement codes used by commercial insurance plans, Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and other government payers for Medicare Part B drugs like EXPAREL. Claims submission and payment are standardized with a J-code, facilitating and streamlining billing and reimbursement. In addition, some commercial insurers require a J-code for payment. 
 Additionally, in November 2024, CMS confirmed that both EXPAREL and iovera qualify as eligible non-opioid pain management products under the NOPAIN Act. Hospital outpatient departments, or HOPDs, and ambulatory surgical centers, or ASCs, that use these products will receive additional Medicare reimbursement beginning January 1, 2025. The reimbursement rate for EXPAREL equates to 106 of the average sales price (ASP +6 in the HOPD and ASC environments using the new product-specific J-code (J0666) beginning January 1, 2025. The separate reimbursement for iovera will pay up to an additional 255.85 when providers administer iovera in ASC and HOPD settings, using a new C-code created for the iovera system (C9809). This new Medicare payment is provided in addition to the current reimbursement available to HOPDs and ASCs when they perform a procedure with the iovera system. 
 In October 2024, we appointed Shawn Cross as our Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Cross brings more than 25 years of experience as a biotechnology executive, board member and investment banker. Most recently, Mr. Cross served in executive positions of increasing responsibility at Applied Molecular Transport, Inc. where he was ultimately named Chief Executive Officer to lead their merger with Cyclo Therapeutics, Inc., where Mr. Cross currently serves on the Board of Directors. His biopharmaceutical investment banking career includes senior leadership roles at JMP Securities, Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. 
 
 EXPAREL 
 
 In the U.S., EXPAREL is currently indicated for local analgesia via infiltration in patients aged six years and older and regional analgesia via interscalene brachial plexus nerve block, sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa, and adductor canal block in adults. Safety and efficacy have not been established in other nerve blocks. In Europe, EXPAREL is approved as a brachial plexus block or femoral nerve block for treatment of post-operative pain in adults, and as a field block for treatment of somatic post-operative pain from small- to medium-sized surgical wounds in adults and children aged six years and older. 
 
 EXPAREL Label Expansion 
 
 Expanding utilization in lower extremity nerve block indications. In February 2024, we launched EXPAREL in two key lower extremity nerve blocks namely an adductor canal block and a sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa. We believe these two key nerve blocks will expand EXPAREL utilization within surgeries of the knee, lower leg, and foot and ankle procedures. The launch is supported by two successful head-to-head Phase 3 studies in which EXPAREL demonstrated four days of superiority to bupivacaine. 
 
 Pediatrics. We have launched a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study of EXPAREL as a single-dose post-surgical infiltration administration in patients under six years of age. If successful, we expect this study, followed by a Phase 3 registration study, will support expansion of the EXPAREL labels in the U.S., European Union, or E.U., and United Kingdom, or U.K. We are also discussing with the FDA, EMA and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) our regulatory strategy for EXPAREL administered as a nerve block in the pediatric setting. We received notification from the FDA that our pediatric studies requirement had been waived for the indications of brachial plexus interscalene and lower extremity nerve block to produce postsurgical regional analgesia in pediatric patients. 
 
 EXPAREL Clinical Benefits 
 
 We believe EXPAREL can replace the use of bupivacaine delivered via elastomeric pumps as the foundation of a multimodal regimen for long-acting postsurgical pain management. Based on our clinical data, EXPAREL: 
 provides long-lasting local or regional analgesia; 
 is a ready-to-use formulation; 
 expands easily with saline or lactated Ringer s solution to reach a desired volume; 
 Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | Page 35

 can be administered for local analgesia via infiltration and for regional analgesia via field block, as well as brachial plexus nerve block, sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa and adductor canal block; and 
 facilitates treatment of a variety of surgical sites. 
 We believe EXPAREL is a key component of long-acting postsurgical pain management regimens that reduce the need for opioids. Based on the clinical data from our Phase 3 and Phase 4 clinical studies as well as data from retrospective health outcomes studies, EXPAREL significantly reduces opioid usage while improving postsurgical pain management. 
 ZILRETTA 
 
 ZILRETTA is the first and only extended-release, intra-articular therapy for OA knee pain. ZILRETTA employs a proprietary microsphere technology combining triamcinolone acetonide, or TA, a commonly administered, immediate-release corticosteroid, with a poly lactic-co-glycolic acid, or PLGA, matrix to provide extended pain relief. PLGA is a proven extended-release delivery vehicle that is metabolized to carbon dioxide and water as it releases drug in the intra-articular space and is used in other approved drug products and surgical devices. The ZILRETTA microspheres slowly and continuously release triamcinolone acetonide into the knee to provide significant pain relief for 12 weeks, with some people experiencing pain relief through 16 weeks. ZILRETTA was approved by the FDA in October 2017 and launched in the U.S. shortly thereafter. 
 
 We believe ZILRETTA s extended-release profile may also provide effective treatment for OA pain of the shoulder and we recently launched a Phase 3 registration study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ZILRETTA for the management of OA pain of the shoulder. If the study is successful, we plan to seek approval to expand the ZILRETTA label to include OA pain of the shoulder. 
 
 ZILRETTA Clinical Benefits 
 
 ZILRETTA combines TA, a commonly administered steroid, with a proprietary, extended-release microsphere technology to administer extended therapeutic concentrations in the joint and persistent analgesic effect. 
 
 Based on the strength of its pivotal and other clinical trials, we believe that ZILRETTA represents an important treatment option for the millions of patients in the U.S. in need of safe and effective extended relief from OA knee pain. The pivotal Phase 3 trial showed that ZILRETTA significantly reduced OA knee pain for 12 weeks, with some people experiencing pain relief through 16 weeks. We believe that ZILRETTA has the potential to become the corticosteroid of choice given its safety and efficacy profile, and the fact that it is the first and only extended-release corticosteroid on the market. In September 2021, the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons, or AAOS, updated its evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, finding ZILRETTA can improve patient outcomes over traditional immediate-release corticosteroids. 
 
 iovera 
 
 The iovera system is a non-opioid handheld cryoanalgesia device used to deliver precise, controlled doses of cold temperature to targeted nerves. It is FDA 510(k) cleared in the U.S., has a CE mark in the E.U. and is cleared for marketing in Canada for the blocking of pain. We believe the iovera system is highly complementary to EXPAREL and ZILRETTA as a non-opioid therapy that alleviates pain using a non-pharmacological nerve block to disrupt pain signals being transmitted to the brain from the site of injury or surgery. It is also indicated for the relief of pain and symptoms associated with arthritis of the knee for up to 90 days. 
 
 iovera Clinical Benefits 
 
 There is a growing body of clinical data demonstrating success with iovera treatment for a wide range of chronic pain conditions. Some of our strongest data relates directly to the improvement of OA pain of the knee. In a pivotal trial evaluating iovera for knee OA pain, the majority of the patients suffering from OA pain of the knee experienced pain relief up to 150 days after being treated with iovera . 
 Surgical intervention is typically a last resort for patients suffering from knee OA pain. Treatment with iovera has also demonstrated effectiveness for managing pain associated with knee replacements. Specifically, findings demonstrated reductions in opioids, including: 
 
 The daily morphine equivalent consumption in the per protocol group analysis was significantly lower at 72 hours (p Table of Contents 

 Patients who were administered iovera were far less likely to take opioids six weeks after surgery. The number of patients taking opioids six weeks after total knee arthroplasty, or TKA, in the control group was three times the number of patients taking opioids in the cryoanalgesia group (14 percent vs. 44 percent, p 
 The Osteoarthritis Market 
 
 OA is the most common form of arthritis. It is also called degenerative joint disease and occurs most frequently in the hands, hips and knees. With OA, the cartilage within a joint begins to break down and the underlying bone begins to change. These changes usually develop slowly and worsen over time. OA can cause pain, stiffness and swelling. In some cases, it also causes reduced function and disability some people are no longer able to do daily tasks or work. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), OA affects over 32.5 million adults in the U.S. 
 The lifetime risk of developing symptomatic knee OA is 45 percent according to the Arthritis Foundation. The prevalence of symptomatic knee OA increases with each decade of life, with the annual incidence of knee OA being highest between age 55 and 64 years old. There are 14 million individuals in the U.S. who have symptomatic knee OA, and nearly two million are under the age of 45. Surgical intervention is typically a last resort for patients suffering from OA of the knee. 
 With ZILRETTA, we now offer clinicians the flexibility to individualize OA knee pain treatment with either ZILRETTA or a drug-free nerve block with iovera based on patient factors and preference, physician training, site of care and reimbursement considerations.

Clinical Development Programs 
 
 PCRX-201 
 
 PCRX-201 (enekinragene inzadenovec) is our novel gene therapy in clinical development as a treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee. Its innovative high-capacity adenovirus, or HCAD, design, manufacturing process, and local administration may solve many of the challenges that have made gene therapy inaccessible for common diseases like osteoarthritis. Key features that support the use of PCRX-201 for a prevalent disease: 
 The HCAD viral vector is more efficient at delivering genes into cells than other vectors, which means we can achieve the desired effect with smaller doses. 
 PCRX-201 is delivered where it matters it is injected locally into the knee joint capsule and contained there for a favorable clinical and safety profile, whereas if administered systemically, a much higher dose would be needed to reach the knee and achieve the desired effect. 
 Smaller doses, local administration, and scalable manufacturing result in an attractive cost of goods profile versus other gene therapies. 
 After injection, the HCAD vector enters joint cells and turns them into factories to boost cellular IL-1Ra production, which blocks IL-1 pathway activation to reduce inflammation and pain in the knee. PCRX-201 uses an inflammation-responsive promoter to only produce IL-1Ra when needed, mimicking how the body naturally responds to inflammation. In a Phase 1 proof-of-concept study of patients with moderate to severe OA of the knee, PCRX-201 was well tolerated with improvements in knee pain observed across all doses. The study enrolled 72 patients in two three-dose cohorts: a co-administered IA steroid cohort and a cohort that did not receive a steroid. PCRX-201 was well tolerated, with efficacy observed through at least 52 weeks at all doses and cohorts. The highest level of efficacy was achieved in the co-administered steroid group, which showed a greater percentage of patients with at least a 50 improvement in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain and stiffness scores, as well as a meaningful improvement in (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score) KOOS functional assessment. The one-year data were presented at the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) 2024 World Congress in April 2024. We now have two-year efficacy and safety data that we have submitted for presentation at the American College of Rheumatology s annual ACR Convergence meeting in November 2024. While other therapies typically provide relief for three to six months, PCRX-201 has already set a new standard with a year or more of sustained pain relief from a single injection. Given these highly encouraging Phase 1 data, we are preparing to launch a Phase 2 clinical study in knee OA in 2025. 
 
 In February 2024, the FDA granted PCRX-201 a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation. Established under the 21 st Century Cures Act, RMAT designation is a dedicated program designed to expedite the development and review processes for promising therapies, including genetic therapies, that are intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or therapy has the potential to address an unmet medical need. PCRX-201 is the first gene therapy product candidate to receive RMAT designation for OA. 
 External Innovation 
 In parallel to our internal clinical programs, we are pursuing innovative acquisition targets that are complementary to EXPAREL, ZILRETTA and iovera and are of great interest to the surgical and anesthesia audiences we are already calling on today. We are using a combination of strategic investments, in-licensing and acquisition transactions to buildout a pipeline of innovation to improve patients journeys along the neural pain pathway. The strategic investments we have made to support promising early-stage platforms are summarized below:

 Pacira Training Facilities 
 
 We maintain and operate two Pacira Innovation and Training, or PIT, facilities one in Tampa, Florida and one in Houston, Texas. These sites were constructed with a singular goal in mind: to advance education on best practice techniques to effectively manage acute pain while reducing or eliminating the need for opioids. These facilities provide clinicians with flexible, state-of-the-art environments for interactive, hands-on instruction on the latest and most innovative local, regional and field block approaches for managing pain, improving patient care and enabling patient migration to the 23-hour stay environment. Each of our PIT facilities feature distinct training spaces, including simulation labs equipped with ultrasound scanning stations; lecture halls that feature liquid crystal display video walls to support live, virtual and global presentations; and green-screen broadcast studios to livestream content with single or multiple hosts. The PIT of Houston has both wet and dry lab space for cadaver and other interactive workshops. The PIT of Tampa also houses our principal executive offices and corporate headquarters.

 months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 primarily due to the sales mix of vial sizes and the timing of orders placed for veterinary use. 
 The following tables provide a summary of activity with respect to our sales related allowances and accruals related to EXPAREL and ZILRETTA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 Returns Allowances Prompt Payment Discounts Service Fees Volume Rebates and Chargebacks Government Rebates Total Balance at December 31, 2023 1,868 1,308 3,697 5,870 1,175 13,918 Provision 1,409 9,260 15,109 81,037 1,955 108,770 Payments / Adjustments (1,975) (9,360) (14,973) (82,770) (1,090) (110,168) Balance at September 30, 2024 1,302 1,208 3,833 4,137 2,040 12,520 
 September 30, 2023 Returns Allowances Prompt Payment Discounts Service Fees Volume Rebates and Chargebacks Government Rebates Total Balance at December 31, 2022 1,691 1,187 3,193 5,452 786 12,309 Provision 1,710 8,835 13,414 69,982 1,588 95,529 Payments / Adjustments (1,287) (8,874) (13,218) (68,676) (1,460) (93,515) Balance at September 30, 2023 2,114 1,148 3,389 6,758 914 14,323 
 Total reductions of gross product sales from sales-related allowances and accruals were 108.8 million and 95.5 million, or 17.6 and 16.3 of gross product sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The overall 1.3 increase in sales-related allowances and accruals as a percentage of gross product sales was primarily related to accruals as a result of higher chargeback-related allowances from expanded contracting efforts. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold primarily relates to the costs to produce, package and deliver our products to customers. These expenses include labor, raw materials, manufacturing overhead and occupancy costs, depreciation of facilities, royalty payments, quality control and engineering. 
 The following table provides information regarding our cost of goods sold and gross margin during the periods indicated, including percent changes (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Increase / (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase / (Decrease) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Cost of goods sold 38,864 39,750 (2) 130,542 136,977 (5) Gross margin 77 76 75 72 
 Gross margin increased one percentage-point in the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 primarily due to favorable ZILRETTA gross margins as the prior period included costs for a new fill line, partially offset by higher EXPAREL royalty expense. We continue to pay royalties associated with the 200-liter EXPAREL manufacturing process to the Research Development Foundation under protest. For more information, see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein. 
 Gross margin increased three percentage-points in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 primarily due to lower EXPAREL product cost as a result of higher production volumes and the absence of ZILRETTA step-up of fixed assets to fair value in accordance with purchase accounting that existed in the prior period, partially offset by higher ZILRETTA inventory reserves.

Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses primarily consist of costs related to clinical trials and related outside services, product development and other research and development costs, including trials that we are conducting to generate new data for EXPAREL, ZILRETTA and iovera , clinical trials for PCRX-201 and stock-based compensation expense. Clinical and preclinical development expenses include costs for clinical personnel, clinical trials performed by third-parties, toxicology studies, materials and supplies, database management and other third-party fees. Product development and manufacturing capacity expansion expenses include development costs for our products and PCRX-201, which include personnel, research equipment, materials and contractor costs for process development and product candidates, development costs related to significant scale-ups of our manufacturing capacity and facility costs for our research space. Regulatory and other expenses include regulatory activities related to unapproved products and indications, medical information and scientific communication expenses, expenses related to our iGOR registry study and related personnel. Stock-based compensation expense relates to the costs of stock option grants, awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. 
 The following table provides a breakout of our research and development expenses during the periods indicated, including percent changes (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Increase / (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase / (Decrease) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Clinical and preclinical development 8,215 6,808 21 22,733 17,263 32 Product development and manufacturing capacity expansion 7,239 9,419 (23) 21,952 26,396 (17) Regulatory and other 1,856 2,383 (22) 7,473 7,318 2 Stock-based compensation 1,794 2,220 (19) 5,522 5,817 (5) Total research and development expense 19,104 20,830 (8) 57,680 56,794 2 of total revenues 11 13 11 12 
 Total research and development expense decreased 8 in three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 and increased 2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023. 
 Clinical and preclinical development expense increased 21 and 32 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023, respectively, due to site start-up of and ongoing enrollment in a ZILRETTA shoulder trial, an EXPAREL pediatric trial and an iovera spasticity trial. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023, these increases were partially offset by the completion of the EXPAREL intrathecal trial cohort 2 enrollment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023, these increases were partially offset by the winding down of a PCRX-201 Phase 1 trial for knee OA as two-year follow-up visits of subjects were completed in November 2023. This Phase 1 trial remains on track for completion by November 2026, the last year of the follow-up period for the last patient dosed. In addition, toxicology studies for product candidates were completed in 2023. 
 Product development and manufacturing capacity expansion expense decreased 23 and 17 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023, respectively, primarily attributable to the completion of pre-commercial scale-up activities of our EXPAREL manufacturing capacity at our Science Center Campus in San Diego, California, which the FDA approved an sNDA for our 200-liter EXPAREL manufacturing suite in February 2024. This new suite was subsequently placed into service in July 2024. The decrease was partially offset by ongoing product development costs related to PCRX-201 and an iovera medial branch Smart Tip. 
 Regulatory and other expense decreased 22 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023, due to the reduction of international regulatory activities and headcount vacancies, partially offset by increased enrollment and additional sites related to an observational registry study which track patients symptoms and experience with pain management related to OA of the knee. Regulatory and other expense increased 2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023, due to increased enrollment and additional sites related to an observational registry study, partially offset by the reduction of international regulatory activities and headcount vacancies. 
 Stock-based compensation decreased 19 and 5 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023, respectively, primarily due to fewer equity awards granted to research and development personnel and headcount vacancies.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits for our sales force and personnel that support our sales, marketing, medical and scientific affairs operations, expenses related to communicating the health outcome benefits of our products, investments in provider-level market access and patient reimbursement support and educational programs for our customers. General and administrative expenses consist of compensation and benefits for legal, finance, regulatory activities related to approved products and indications, compliance, information technology, human resources, business development, executive management and other supporting personnel. It also includes professional fees for legal, audit, tax and consulting services. Stock-based compensation expense relates to the costs of stock option grants, RSU awards and our ESPP. 
 The following table provides information regarding our selling, general and administrative expenses during the periods indicated, including percent changes (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Increase / (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase / (Decrease) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Sales and marketing 43,191 38,261 13 121,673 117,302 4 General and administrative 22,005 20,648 7 66,842 61,112 9 Stock-based compensation 9,137 9,038 1 25,970 25,226 3 Total selling, general and administrative expense 74,333 67,947 9 214,485 203,640 5 of total revenues 44 41 42 41 
 Total selling, general and administrative expense increased 9 and 5 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023, respectively. 
 Sales and marketing expense increased 13 and 4 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023. The three and nine months increase was driven by investing in programs to drive awareness and education for our customers and enhance our marketing, market access and reimbursement teams and value creation for the implementation of separate Medicare reimbursement for EXPAREL at average sales price plus 6 percent in HOPD settings and iovera at up to an additional 255.85 when providers administer iovera in ASC and HOPD settings beginning in January 2025 as part of the NOPAIN Act. We expect investments in these programs to continue through the end of 2024 as we have launched our national campaign Make the NOPAIN Pact which targets hospital pharmacists, administrators, clinicians and revenue management teams and is focused on ensuring these audiences are ready for the commencement of the NOPAIN Act. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 also benefited from a grant to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Charitable Foundation that occurred in the prior periods. These increases were partially offset by the impact of a February 2024 restructuring program. 
 General and administrative expense increased 7 and 9 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023, respectively. The three month increase in legal expenses was mostly driven by ongoing litigation and an increase in personnel related expenses. The nine month increase was primarily driven by third-party management consulting to assess strategic opportunities and market assessments for our products and compensatory costs associated with the transition to our new Chief Executive Officer effective January 2, 2024, which include compensation related to the current Chief Executive Officer and to the former Chief Executive Officer who remains an advisor to the Company in a consulting capacity. 
 For more information on our ongoing litigation, see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein. 
 Stock-based compensation increased 1 and 3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023, respectively, primarily due to greater equity awards granted to personnel. 
 
 Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets 
 The following table provides a summary of the amortization of acquired intangible assets during the periods indicated, including percent changes (dollar amounts in thousands):

 As part of the Flexion Acquisition and the MyoScience Acquisition, we acquired intangible assets consisting of developed technology intangible assets and customer relationships, with estimated useful lives between 9 and 14 years. For more information, see Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 The following table provides a summary of goodwill impairments during the periods indicated, including percent changes (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Increase / (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase / (Decrease) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Goodwill impairment 163,243 N/A 163,243 N/A 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the FDA approved a generic competitor to EXPAREL and a U.S. District Court ruled that one of our patents was not valid (for more information, see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein). Due to these events and a subsequent decrease in our common stock price, it was determined these qualitative factors indicated it was more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill may be less than its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment through a discounted cash flow model (or income approach), which resulted in the carrying value of the Company exceeding its fair value by more than the goodwill balance. As a result, the goodwill balance of 163.2 million was recorded as fully impaired during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Contingent Consideration (Gains) Charges, Restructuring Charges and Other 
 The following table provides a summary of the costs related to the contingent consideration, acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges during the periods indicated, including percent changes (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Increase / (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase / (Decrease) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Flexion contingent consideration (3,244) 2,793 N/A (5,541) (3,847) 44 Restructuring charges 1,193 173 100 + 7,724 1,109 100 + Acquisition-related expenses 285 390 (27) 689 1,588 (57) Total contingent consideration (gains) charges, restructuring charges and other (1,766) 3,356 N/A 2,872 (1,150) N/A 
 Total contingent consideration (gains) charges, restructuring charges and other for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included gains of 1.8 million and charges of 2.9 million, respectively. Total contingent consideration (gains) charges, restructuring charges and other for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included charges of 3.4 million and gains of 1.2 million, respectively. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a contingent consideration gain of 3.2 million and 5.5 million, respectively, primarily due to adjustments reflecting the probability of achieving the remaining Flexion regulatory milestone by the milestone expiration date, partially offset by revisions to the latest discount rates. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized contingent consideration charges of 2.8 million primarily due to market volatility which affects the liability s present value. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized gains of 3.8 million primarily due to adjustments to long-term forecasts which reduced the probability of meeting the Flexion sales-based contingent consideration milestones by December 31, 2030, the expiration date for achieving

Table of Contents 

 the milestones. The gains recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were partially offset by a decrease in the assumed discount rate that is utilized in calculating the liability s present value, based on a significant improvement in our incremental borrowing rate resulting from the TLA Credit Agreement (as defined below) entered into in March 2023. 
 In February 2024, we initiated a restructuring plan to ensure that we are well positioned for long-term growth. The restructuring plan included, among other things: (i) reshaping the Company s executive team; (ii) reallocating efforts and resources from our ex-U.S. and certain early-stage development programs to our commercial portfolio in the U.S. market; and (iii) reprioritizing investments to focus on other commercial initiatives. As a result, d uring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized restructuring charges of 1.2 million and 7.7 million, respectively, related to employee termination benefits, such as the acceleration of share-based compensation, severance, and, to a lesser extent, other employment-related termination costs, as well as contract termination costs. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we implemented a restructuring plan in an effort to improve our operational efficiencies and recognized 0.2 million and 1.1 million, respectively, in one-time employee termination benefits through a reduction of headcount. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized acquisition-related expenses of 0.3 million and 0.7 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized acquisition-related expenses of 0.4 million and 1.6 million, respectively. These costs primarily related to vacant and underutilized Flexion leases that were assumed from the Flexion Acquisition

 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 The following table provides information regarding other income (expense), net during the periods indicated, including percent changes (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Increase / (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase / (Decrease) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest income 5,482 2,766 98 14,134 8,019 76 Interest expense (4,689) (3,464) 35 (11,889) (16,918) (30) Gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt 7,518 (16,926) N/A Other, net (122) (422) (71) (320) (701) (54) Total other income (expense), net 671 (1,120) N/A 9,443 (26,526) N/A 
 Total other income, net was 0.7 million and 9.4 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Total other expense, net was 1.1 million and 26.5 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The substantial increases in interest income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 were due to higher overall investment balances. 
 The 35 increase in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 was primarily driven by the issuance of the 2029 Notes (as defined below) in May 2024. The 30 decrease in interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 was primarily driven by the lower outstanding principal associated with the TLA Term Loan (as defined below) that was entered into on March 31, 2023 which replaced our then-outstanding TLB Term Loan (as defined below) that had a higher principal balance and interest rate, partially offset by issuing the 2029 Notes in May 2024. 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 7.5 million gain on early extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the repurchase of 200.0 million aggregate principal of our 2025 Notes (as defined below). The partial repurchase of the 2025 Notes was completed with our net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes (as defined below). 
 Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | Page 45 

Table of Contents 

 In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in conjunction with the entry into the TLA Credit Agreement, we incurred a 16.9 million loss on early extinguishment of debt as a result of the retirement of 287.5 million aggregate principal of our TLB Term Loan (as defined below). 
 For more information, see Note 8, Debt , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The following table provides information regarding our income tax expense during the periods indicated, including percent changes (dollar amounts in thousands):

 The effective tax rates were (3) and (30) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The effective tax rates were 35 and 39 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Income tax expense represents the estimated annual effective tax rate applied to the year-to-date domestic operating results adjusted for certain discrete tax items. 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily impacted by non-deductible goodwill impairment charges. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily impacted by non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and costs related to non-deductible stock-based compensation, mainly related to expired stock options. 
 The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 include costs related to non-deductible stock-based compensation and non-deductible executive compensation, partially offset by credits and a fair-value adjustment for the contingent consideration. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception in 2006, we have devoted most of our cash resources to manufacturing, research and development and selling, general and administrative activities related to the development and commercialization of EXPAREL. In addition, we acquired ZILRETTA as part of the Flexion Acquisition in November 2021 and iovera as part of the MyoScience Acquisition in April 2019. We are primarily dependent on the commercial success of EXPAREL and ZILRETTA. We have financed our operations primarily with the proceeds from the sale of convertible senior notes and other debt, common stock, product sales and collaborative licensing and milestone revenue. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 222.4 million, cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments of 453.8 million and working capital of 383.6 million. 
 We expect that our cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments on hand will be adequate to cover our short-term liquidity needs, and that we would be able to access other sources of financing should the need arise. 
 Summary of Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data: 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 156,257 107,065 Investing activities (82,908) 69,167 Financing activities 19,318 (181,252) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 92,667 (5,020)

Table of Contents 

 Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 156.3 million, compared to 107.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 49.2 million was primarily attributable to increased revenue with favorable gross margins, lower interest paid and a 13.0 million payment made in the prior year for a termination fee relating to a licensing agreement. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 82.9 million, which reflected 74.4 million of outflows from available-for-sale investment purchases (net of sales), as well as 8.5 million of capital expenditures for manufacturing product fill lines and for an EXPAREL capacity expansion project at our Science Center Campus in San Diego, California. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was 69.2 million, which reflected proceeds from 89.3 million of available-for-sale investment sales (net of purchases), partially offset by purchases of fixed assets of 13.4 million for fill lines for our products and equipment for an EXPAREL capacity expansion project at our Science Center Campus in San Diego, California and purchases of equity and debt investments of 6.8 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 19.3 million, which primarily consisted of 287.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes. We used the majority of the proceeds from the 2029 Notes to make a partial repurchase of the 2025 Notes in the amount of 191.0 million, enter into a capped call transaction for 26.7 million, repurchase 25.0 million of treasury stock, and pay debt issuance and financing costs of 9.4 million. Additionally, we paid the remaining 8.6 million of 3.375 convertible senior notes due 2024 assumed from the Flexion Acquisition (the Flexion 2024 Notes upon their maturity and made 8.4 million voluntary prepayments associated with the TLA Term Loan. See Note 8, Debt , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion on the Flexion 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2029 Notes, the capped call transaction and the TLA Term Loan. There was also 1.4 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our ESPP. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 181.3 million, which consisted of a 296.9 million repayment of TLB Term Loan principal as well as a 5.8 million prepayment penalty in connection with the retirement of the TLB Term Loan facility and 30.6 million repayments of TLA Term Loan principal, partially offset by the net proceeds from the TLA Term Loan of 149.6 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 1.9 million and 1.7 million from the issuance of common stock through our ESPP. 
 Debt 
 2028 Term Loan A Facility 
 On March 31, 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (as amended to date, the TLA Credit Agreement to refinance the indebtedness outstanding under our TLB Credit Agreement (as defined and discussed below). The term loan issued under the TLA Credit Agreement (the TLA Term Loan was issued at a 0.30 discount and provides for a single-advance term loan A facility in the principal amount of 150.0 million, which is secured by substantially all of our and any subsidiary guarantor s assets and matures on March 31, 2028. We may elect to borrow either (i) alternate base rate borrowings or (ii) term benchmark borrowings or daily simple SOFR (as defined in the TLA Credit Agreement) borrowings. Each term loan borrowing which is an alternate base rate borrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the TLA Credit Agreement), plus (ii) a spread based on our Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio ranging from 2.00 to 2.75 . Each term loan borrowing which is a term benchmark borrowing or daily simple SOFR borrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (as each is defined in the TLA Credit Agreement), plus (ii) a spread based on our Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio ranging from 3.00 to 3.75 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made voluntary principal prepayments of 8.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we made a scheduled principal payment of 2.8 million as well as 30.6 million of voluntary principal prepayments. Due to voluntary principal prepayments made, we are not required to make further principal payments until September 2026, although we retain the option to do so. As of September 30, 2024, borrowings under the TLA Term Loan consisted entirely of term benchmark borrowings at a rate of 7.95 . 
 The TLA Credit Agreement requires us to, among other things, maintain (i) a Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of no greater than 3.00 to 1.00 and (ii) a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the TLA Credit Agreement), determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of 
 Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | Page 47 

Table of Contents 

 no less than 1.50 to 1.00. The TLA Credit Agreement requires us to maintain an unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance of at least 500.0 million less any prepayments of the 2025 Notes (as defined below) at any time from 91 days prior to the maturity date through the earlier of (i) the latest maturity date of the 2025 Notes and (ii) the date on which there is no outstanding principal amount of the 2025 Notes, which we expect to accomplish. The TLA Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, financial covenants, representations and warranties, events of default and other provisions. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the TLA Credit Agreement. See Note 8, Debt , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion. 
 2029 Convertible Senior Notes 
 In May 2024, we completed a private placement of 287.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.125 convertible senior notes due 2029, or 2029 Notes, and entered into an indenture with respect to the 2029 Notes. The 2029 Notes accrue interest at a fixed rate of 2.125 per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 th and November 15 th of each year. The 2029 Notes mature on May 15, 2029. 
 At September 30, 2024, all 287.5 million of principal was outstanding on the 2029 Notes. See Note 8, Debt , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion. 
 2025 Convertible Senior Notes 
 In July 2020, we completed a private placement of 402.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 0.750 convertible senior notes due 2025, or 2025 Notes, and entered into an indenture with respect to the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes accrue interest at a fixed rate of 0.750 per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 st and August 1 st of each year. The 2025 Notes mature on August 1, 2025. 
 In May 2024, we used part of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes to repurchase 200.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes in privately negotiated transactions at a discount for 191.4 million in cash (including accrued interest). The partial repurchase of the 2025 Notes resulted in a 7.5 million gain on early extinguishment of debt. 
 At September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal on the 2025 Notes was 202.5 million. See Note 8, Debt , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion. 
 Future Capital Requirements 
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale investments and cash received from product sales will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and payment of the interest and principal on our TLA Term Loan, 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes through the next 12 months. Our future use of operating cash and capital requirements will depend on many forward-looking factors, including, but not limited to: 
 the cost and timing of the potential milestone payments to former Flexion stockholders, which could be up to an aggregate of 372.3 million if certain regulatory and commercial milestones are met. See Note 9, Financial Instruments , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for more information; 
 the impact of global economic conditions including the impact of inflation on our product, material and labor costs, supply chain, longer lead-times, an inability to secure a sufficient supply of materials, our operating expenses and our business strategy; 
 the timing of and extent to which the holders of our 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes elect to convert their 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes, the timing of principal and interest payments on our TLA Term Loan and the timing and impact of increases to the variable interest rate on our TLA Term Loan borrowings in accordance with the terms of the TLA Credit Agreement; 
 the costs and our ability to successfully continue to expand the commercialization of EXPAREL, ZILRETTA and iovera 
 the cost and timing of expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities; 
 the cost and timing of additional strategic investments, including additional investments under existing agreements; 
 the costs related to legal and regulatory matters, including those to develop and defend our intellectual property; 
 Pacira BioSciences, Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | Page 48 

Table of Contents 

 the costs of performing additional clinical trials for our products, including the additional pediatric trials required by the FDA and EMA as a condition of the approval of EXPAREL; 
 the costs for the development and commercialization of other product candidates; 
 the costs and timing of future payments under our employee benefit plans, including but not limited to our cash long-term incentive plan and non-qualified deferred compensation plan; 
 the timing and the number of shares of our common stock repurchased through our share repurchase program; and 
 the extent to which we acquire or invest in products, businesses and technologies. 
 We may require additional debt or equity financing to meet our future operating and capital requirements. We have no committed external sources of funds, and additional equity or debt financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In particular, capital market disruptions or negative economic conditions may hinder our access to capital. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination and is subject to impairment testing at least annually or upon the occurrence of a triggering event that could indicate a potential impairment. We have historically tested goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment in order to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that reporting unit fair values are greater than their carrying values. This has historically been performed using readily available market data and company-specific factors. 
 If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is required. This is performed by comparing the fair value of the Company with its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge up to the carrying value of goodwill. The fair value of the Company was calculated through an income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to assume fair value. Our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and future margins. Additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated discount rates and the probability of success for our product pipeline candidate products. We believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. 
 For more information, see Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein. 
 For a description of critical accounting policies that affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, refer to our 2023 Annual Report . Outside of the aforementioned, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies nor any recently issued accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on our financial results since December 31, 2023.

 Contractual Obligations 
 In May 2024, we completed a private placement of 287.5 million of our 2029 Notes, and entered into an indenture with respect to the 2029 Notes. The 2029 Notes accrue interest at a fixed rate of 2.125 per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 th and November 15 th of each year. The 2029 Notes mature on May 15, 2029. At September 30, 2024, all 287.5 million of principal was outstanding on the 2029 Notes. 
 In May 2024, we used part of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes to repurchase 200.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes in privately negotiated transactions at a discount for 191.4 million in cash (including accrued interest). At September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal on the 2025 Notes was 202.5 million. 
 In May 2024, the remaining principal of the 3.375 convertible senior notes due 2024 (the Flexion 2024 Notes in the amount of 8.6 million was repaid at maturity. 
 See Note 8, Debt , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion. 
 Outside of the issuance of the 2029 Notes, the partial repurchase of the 2025 Notes and the repayment of the Flexion 2024 Notes, there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations relating to our indebtedness, lease obligations and purchase obligations from those reported in our 2023 Annual Report. For more information on our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, see Part II, Item 7 in our 2023 Annual Report . 
 
 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The primary objective of our cash equivalents and investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income that we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. We invest in corporate bonds, commercial paper, asset-backed securities and U.S. Treasury and other government agency notes for purposes other than trading which are reported at fair value. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the interest rate later rises, we expect that the fair value of our investment will decline. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have reduced the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2024 by approximately 0.9 million. 
 The fair value of our 2025 Notes is impacted by both the fair value of our common stock and interest rate fluctuations. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of the 2025 Notes was 956 per 1,000 principal amount. See Note 8, Debt , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of our 2025 Notes, which bear interest at a fixed rate. At September 30, 2024, 202.5 million of principal remains outstanding on the 2025 Notes. 
 The fair value of our 2029 Notes is impacted by both the fair value of our common stock and interest rate fluctuations. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of the 2029 Notes was 757 per 1,000 principal amount. See Note 8, Debt , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of our 2029 Notes, which bear interest at a fixed rate. At September 30, 2024, 287.5 million of principal remains outstanding on the 2029 Notes. 
 The TLA Term Loan provides for a single-advance term loan in the principal amount of 150.0 million and is scheduled to mature on March 31, 2028. Each term loan borrowing that is a term benchmark borrowing or daily simple SOFR borrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (as each is defined in the TLA Credit Agreement), plus (ii) a spread based on our Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio ranging from 3.00 to 3.75 . At September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal on the TLA Term Loan was 108.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, borrowings under the TLA Term Loan consisted entirely of term benchmark borrowings at a rate of 7.95 . A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase interest expense over the next 12 months by approximately 1.1 million, based on the balance outstanding for these borrowings as of September 30, 2024. 
 We have agreements with certain vendors and partners that operate in foreign jurisdictions. The more significant transactions are primarily denominated in the U.S. Dollar, subject to an annual adjustment based on changes in currency exchange rates. 
 Additionally, our accounts receivable are primarily concentrated with four large wholesalers of pharmaceutical products. In the event of non-performance or non-payment, there may be a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or net cash flow.

 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. As defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

 3. Amendment to Section 9(d) of the Original Agreement . Section 9(d) of the Original Agreement is hereby amended and restated to read in its entirety as follows 
 (d) Withholding Section 280G .

 (ii) Section 280G . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement to the contrary, if any payments or benefits provided for under the Agreement, together with any payments or benefits otherwise payable or provided to the Employee by the Company or Parent (or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) or otherwise 
 (A) constitute parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and 
 (B) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then the Employee s payments and benefits will be either (1) delivered in full or (2) delivered to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such payments and benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by the Employee on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of payments and benefits, even if the payments and benefits may still be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. If clause (2) applies, the payments and benefits will be reduced by the Company in its reasonable discretion in the following order (x) reduction of cash payments, which will occur in reverse chronological order with the cash payment owed on the latest date following the event triggering the Excise Tax being the first cash payment to be reduced (y) cancellation of accelerated vesting of equity awards, which will occur in the reverse order of the date of grant for the equity awards i.e. , the vesting of the most recently granted equity awards will be reduced first) and (z) reduction of other employee benefits, 

which will occur in reverse chronological order with the benefit owed on the latest date following the event triggering the excise tax being the first benefit to be reduced. With respect to each of clauses (x)-(z) of this Section 9(d)(ii) , if any payments or benefits constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the reduction will occur first as to amounts that are not nonqualified deferred compensation.

The Company and the Employee will furnish to the Tax Counsel information as the Tax Counsel may reasonably request to make a determination under this Section 9(d)(ii) . 
 4. Amendment to Section 9(j) of the Original Agreement . Section 9(j) of the Original Agreement is hereby amended and restated to read in its entirety as follows 
 (j) Governing Law Jury Waiver Choice of Venue. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws. For claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement that are not subject to the Parties agreement to arbitrate, such actions shall be commenced only in a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in Morris County, New Jersey and the Company and the Employee each consents to the jurisdiction of such a court. Both the Company and the Employee expressly and irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right that any party either has or may have to a jury trial of any dispute, legal action, proceeding, or cause of action arising out of or in any way related to the Employee s employment with or termination from the Company. This jury waiver includes both claims that are subject to the Parties agreement to arbitrate and claims that are not subject to the Parties agreement to arbitrate. Each party certifies and acknowledges that (a) no representative of the other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that the other party would not seek to enforce the foregoing jury waiver in the event of a legal action, (b) it has considered the implications of this jury waiver, (c) it makes this jury waiver knowingly and voluntarily, and (d) it has decided to enter into this agreement in consideration of, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this section. 

5. Amendment to Add a New Section 9(k) to the Original Agreement . A new subsection (k) is hereby added at the end of Section 9 of the Original Agreement to read as follows 
 (k) Arbitration . The Parties agree that, subject to the exclusions set forth in this Section 9(a), any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to (i) this Agreement, (ii) any alleged breach of this Agreement, (iii) Employee s employment with the Company, (iv) any claim as to arbitrability, enforceability, validity or the scope of this agreement to arbitrate, (v) any claims for alleged discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, (vi) any claims related to wages or compensation or (vii) any claims related to any alleged violation of any federal, state or local law, must be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the terms of this agreement to arbitrate. The Parties agree that this agreement to arbitrate does not include (i) claims for emergency or temporary injunctive relief, (ii) claims for sexual harassment and sexual assault, and (iii) claims that, as a matter of federal, state or local law, the Parties cannot agree to arbitrate, on a pre-dispute basis or otherwise (unless such claims are preempted by federal law). In the event of a dispute regarding sexual assault or sexual harassment claims, the Parties can, at that time, agree to arbitrate such sexual harassment and sexual assault claims. The arbitration will take place in Parsippany, New Jersey, or such other location as the Parties may agree, or where otherwise required by applicable law. The arbitration will take place in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then applicable to employment-related disputes (available at https www.adr.org sites default files Employment_Rules_Web.pdf ), and any judgment upon any award may be entered in the state or federal court having jurisdiction over such award. Unless applicable law requires otherwise, the arbitrator will apply the substantive law of New Jersey, except for any claim to which federal substantive law would apply. The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that this Agreement involves interstate commerce and the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration provision will be governed by the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.

Upon the occurrence of a Reorganization Event other than a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the repurchase and other rights of the Company with respect to outstanding Restricted Stock shall inure to the benefit of the Company s successor and shall, unless the Committee determines otherwise, apply to the cash, securities or other property which the Common Stock was converted into or exchanged for pursuant to such Reorganization Event in the same manner and to the same extent as they applied to such Restricted Stock provided , however , that the Committee may provide for termination or deemed satisfaction of such repurchase or other rights under the instrument evidencing any Restricted Stock or any other agreement between a Participant and the Company, either initially or by amendment. Upon the occurrence of a Reorganization Event involving the liquidation or dissolution of the Company, except to the extent specifically provided to the contrary in the instrument evidencing any Restricted Stock or any other agreement between a Participant and the Company, all restrictions and conditions on all Restricted Stock then outstanding shall automatically be deemed terminated or satisfied. 
 10. General Provisions Applicable to Awards 
 
 (a) Transferability of Awards . Awards shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the person to whom they are granted, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, other than in the case of Awards that are subject to Section 409A of the Code, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, and, during the life of the Participant, shall be exercisable only by the Participant provided, however , except with respect to Awards that are subject to Section 409A of the Code, that the Committee may permit or provide in an Award for the gratuitous transfer of the Award by the Participant to or for the benefit of any immediate family member, family trust or other entity established for the benefit of the Participant and or an immediate family member thereof if the Company would be eligible to use a Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for the registration of the sale of the Common Stock subject to such Award to such proposed transferee provided further , that the Company shall not be required to recognize any such permitted transfer until such time as such permitted transferee shall, as a condition to such transfer, deliver to the Company a written instrument in form and substance satisfactory to the Company confirming that such transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Award. References to a Participant, to the extent relevant in the context, shall include references to authorized transferees. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Section 10(a) shall be deemed to restrict a transfer to the Company. 
 
 (b) Documentation . Each Award shall be evidenced in such form (written, electronic or otherwise) as the Committee shall determine. Each Award may contain terms and conditions in addition to those set forth in the Plan.

 (e) Withholding . The Participant must satisfy all applicable federal, state, and local or other income and employment tax withholding obligations before the Company will deliver stock certificates or otherwise recognize ownership of Common Stock under an Award.

If the Company elects not to or cannot withhold from other compensation, the Participant must pay the Company the full amount, if any, required for withholding or have a broker tender to the Company cash equal to the withholding obligations. Payment of withholding obligations is due before the Company will issue any shares on exercise, vesting or release from forfeiture of an Award or at the same time as payment of the exercise or purchase price, unless the Company determines otherwise. If provided for in an Award or approved by the Committee in its sole discretion, a Participant may satisfy such tax obligations in whole or in part by delivery (either by actual delivery or attestation) of shares of Common Stock, including shares retained from the Award creating the tax obligation, valued at their Fair Market Value provided, however , except as otherwise provided by the Committee, that the total tax withholding where stock is being used to satisfy such tax obligations cannot exceed the Company s minimum statutory withholding obligations (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income). Shares used to satisfy tax withholding requirements cannot be subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting or other similar requirements.

Dividend Equivalents may be settled in cash, shares of Common Stock or other property, as determined in the discretion of the Committee. Dividend Equivalents may have such other terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine provided, however, that no such Dividend Equivalents may be granted in tandem with, linked to, contingent upon or otherwise payable on the exercise of, any Option or SAR and, provided further, that, if dividends are declared during the period that an Award is outstanding, such Dividend Equivalents shall be accumulated but remain subject to performance and or vesting requirement(s) to the same extent as the applicable Award and shall be paid only at the time or times such performance and or vesting requirement(s) are satisfied.
