and an estimated fair value of approximately and , respectively, purchased through and held in custody by a broker-dealer affiliate of Bank of America, N.A., that has experienced failed auctions (the Failed Auction Security since February 2008. The Failed Auction Security held by the Company is Aaa/AA+ rated by major credit rating agencies, is collateralized by student loans, and is guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Management is not aware of any reason to believe the issuer of the Failed Auction Security is presently at risk of default. Through September 30, 2024 , the Company has continued to receive interest payments on the Failed Auction Security in accordance with the terms of its indenture. Management believes the Company ultimately should be able to liquidate the Failed Auction Security without significant loss primarily due to the overall quality of the issue held and the collateral securing the substantial majority of the underlying obligation. However, current conditions in the auction rate securities market have led management to conclude the recovery period for the Failed Auction Security . As a result, the Company continued to classify the Failed Auction Security as long-term as of September 30, 2024.

Effective income tax rate 

() 

() 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company calculated the U.S. income tax provision using the discrete method as this was more appropriate given the facts and circumstances. The Company determined that the application of the estimated annual effective tax rate method generally required by Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, Income Taxes, results in a disproportionate tax provision (benefit) for income taxes for the quarter relative to the expected provision for the full year. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily due to the Company s full valuation allowance position against domestic deferred tax assets. The (benefit) provision for 

 - 12 - 

Table of Contents 

 VICOR CORPORATION Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2024 (unaudited) 

 against all net domestic deferred tax assets for which realization cannot be considered more likely than not at this time. Management assesses the need for the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers all positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and past financial performance. The Company faces uncertainties in forecasting its operating results due to supply and factory capacity constraints, certain process issues with the production of Advanced Products and the unpredictability in certain markets. This operating uncertainty also makes it difficult to predict the availability and utilization of tax benefits over the next several years. As a result, management has concluded, as of September 30, 2024, it is more likely than not the Company s net domestic deferred tax assets will not be realized, and a full valuation allowance against all net domestic deferred tax assets is still warranted as of September 30, 2024. The valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets may require adjustment in the future based on changes in the mix of temporary differences, changes in tax laws, and operating performance. If the positive operating results continue, and the Company s concerns about industry uncertainty and world events, supply and factory capacity constraints, and process issues with the production of Advanced Products are resolved, and the amount of tax benefits the Company is able to utilize to the point that the Company believes future taxable income can be more reliably forecasted, the Company may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance in the near-term. If and when the Company determines the valuation allowance should be released (i.e., reduced), the adjustment would result in a tax benefit reported in that period s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, the effect of which would be an increase in reported net income. The Company was informed in September 2021 by the Internal Revenue Service of their intention to examine the Company s 2019 Federal income tax return. The IRS has closed examination of the 2019 tax year with no material adjustments. There are no other audits or examinations in process in any other jurisdiction.

of cancelable and non-cancelable capital expenditure commitments, principally for manufacturing equipment. As previously reported in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K, the Company is the defendant in a patent infringement lawsuit originally filed on January 28, 2011 by SynQor, Inc. SynQor in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the District Court ). SynQor alleged that certain Vicor products infringed certain United States Patents owned by SynQor. On October 26, 2022, after a trial in the District Court, the jury returned a verdict finding that the Company willfully infringed one SynQor patent, and awarding SynQor damages in the amount of . On May 20, 2024, the District Court issued an Amended Corrected Final Judgment, awarding SynQor actual damages of , enhanced damages of , costs in the amount of approximately , attorney fees in the amount of , and pre-judgment interest of approximately , for a total judgment of approximately .

On May 22, 2024, the Company filed an appeal of the District Court s judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. That appeal remains pending. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company recorded a litigation related accrual of in the third quarter of 2022 and incremental litigation related accruals of in the first quarter of 2024 and in the second quarter of 2024 when the Amended Corrected Final Judgment was issued, for a total of , as its estimate based on the

 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, within the Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Statement of Operations and the associated Accrued litigation account. On July 11, 2024, purported stockholders of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and the Company s Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman. The plaintiffs allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), due to allegedly false and misleading statements during earnings calls in 2023 about the Company s commercial relationship with an existing customer. The complaint seeks damages, interest and attorneys fees and costs. The plaintiffs were appointed lead plaintiffs on October 24, 2024. The Company believes the plaintiffs claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against the lawsuit. On July 25, 2024, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Company; the Company s Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman; the Company s Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and Director; and the Company s Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing and Director. The plaintiffs alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, due to allegedly false and misleading statements during earnings calls in 2023 about the Company s commercial relationship with an existing customer. The complaint sought damages, interest and attorneys' fees and costs. On September 24, 2024, the class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts was voluntarily dismissed, without prejudice. In addition, the Company is involved in certain other litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of its business, both as a defendant and a plaintiff. While the outcome of such other lawsuits and claims against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not expect such litigation or claims will have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.

 VICOR CORPORATION Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations September 30, 2024 

 Overview 
 We design, develop, manufacture, and market modular power components and power systems for converting electrical power for use in electrically-powered devices. Our competitive position is supported by innovations in product design and achievements in product performance, largely enabled by our focus on the research and development of advanced technologies and processes, often implemented in proprietary semiconductor circuitry, materials, and packaging. Many of our products incorporate patented or proprietary implementations of high-frequency switching topologies enabling power system solutions that are more efficient and much smaller than conventional alternatives. Our strategy emphasizes demonstrable product differentiation and a value proposition based on competitively superior solution performance, advantageous design flexibility, and a compelling total cost of ownership. While we offer a wide range of alternating current AC and direct current DC power conversion products, we consider our core competencies to be associated with 48V DC distribution, which offers numerous inherent cost and performance advantages over lower distribution voltages. However, we also offer products addressing other DC voltage standards (e.g., 380V for power distribution in data centers, 110V for rail applications, 28V for military and avionics applications, and 24V for industrial automation). 
 Based on design, performance, and form factor considerations, as well as the range of evolving applications for which our products are appropriate, we categorize our product portfolios as either Advanced Products or Brick Products. The Advanced Products category consists of our more recently introduced products, which are largely used to implement our proprietary Factorized Power Architecture FPA ), an innovative power distribution architecture enabling flexible, rapid power system design using individual components optimized to perform a specific conversion function. 
 The Brick Products category largely consists of our broad and well-established families of integrated power converters, incorporating multiple conversion stages, used in conventional power systems architectures. Given the growth profiles of the markets we serve with our Advanced Products line and our Brick Products line, our strategy involves a transition in organizational focus, emphasizing investment in our Advanced Products line and targeting high growth market segments with a low-mix, high-volume operational model, while maintaining a profitable business in the mature market segments we serve with our Brick Products line with a high-mix, low-volume operational model. 
 The applications in which our Advanced Products and Brick Products are used are typically in the higher-performance, higher-power segments of the market segments we serve. With our Advanced Products, we generally serve large Original Equipment Manufacturers OEMs ), Original Design Manufacturers ODMs ), and their contract manufacturers, with sales currently concentrated in the data center and hyperscaler segments of enterprise computing, in which our products are used for power delivery on server motherboards, in server racks, and across datacenter infrastructure. We have established a leadership position in the emerging market segment for powering high-performance processors used for acceleration of applications associated with artificial intelligence AI ). Our customers in the AI market segment include the leading innovators in processor and accelerator design, as well as early adopters in cloud computing and high performance computing. We also serve applications in aerospace and aviation, defense electronics, satellites, factory automation, instrumentation, test equipment, transportation, telecommunications and networking infrastructure, and vehicles (notably in the autonomous driving, electric vehicle, and hybrid vehicle niches of the vehicle segment). With our Brick Products, we generally serve a fragmented base of large and small customers, concentrated in aerospace and defense electronics, industrial equipment, instrumentation and test equipment, and transportation (notably in rail and heavy equipment applications). With our strategic emphasis on larger, high-volume customers, we expect to experience over time a greater concentration of sales among relatively fewer customers. 
 Our quarterly consolidated operating results can be difficult to forecast and have been subject to significant fluctuations. We plan our production and inventory levels based on management s estimates of customer demand, customer forecasts, and other information sources. Customer forecasts, particularly those of OEM, ODM, and contract manufacturing customers to which we supply Advanced Products in high volumes, are subject to scheduling changes on short notice, contributing to operating inefficiencies and excess costs. In addition, external factors such as supply chain uncertainties, which are often associated with the cyclicality of the electronics industry, regional macroeconomic and trade-related circumstances, and force majeure events (most recently evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic), have caused our operating results to vary meaningfully. Supply chain disruptions, including those associated with our reliance on outsourced package process steps that are essential in the production of some of our Advanced Products, and those relating, for example, to the procurement of raw material, have in the past negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact our operating results. We have taken steps to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions by, among other things and in varying degrees, moving outsourced manufacturing steps in-house to the Company, ordering supplies with extended lead times, paying higher prices for certain supplies or outsourced production, and expediting deliveries at a cost premium. The resulting

 impact of the steps taken to mitigate supply chain disruptions have, to varying degrees and at different times, reduced our revenue, gross margin, operating profit and cash flow and may continue to do so in the future. Our quarterly gross margin as a percentage of net revenues may vary, depending on production volumes, average selling prices, average unit costs, the mix of products sold during that quarter, and the level of importation of raw materials subject to tariffs. Our quarterly operating margin as a percentage of net revenues also may vary with changes in revenue and product level profitability, but our operating costs are largely associated with compensation and related employee costs, which are not subject to sudden or significant changes. 
 Summary of Third Quarter 2024 Financial Performance Compared to Second Quarter 2024 Financial Performance 
 The following summarizes our financial performance for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the second quarter of 2024: 
 Net revenues increased 8.5 to 93,166,000 for the third quarter of 2024, from 85,854,000 for the second quarter of 2024. Net revenues for Brick Products increased 10.8 compared to the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to market demand. Advanced Products net revenues increased 6.5 compared to the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to increased royalty revenue in the third quarter of 2024. 

Export sales represented approximately 49.0 of total net revenues in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 43.3 in the second quarter of 2024. 

Gross margin increased to 45,744,000 for the third quarter of 2024 from 42,771,000 for the second quarter of 2024, with gross margin, as a percentage of net revenues, decreasing to 49.1 for the third quarter of 2024 from 49.8 for the second quarter of 2024. The increase in gross margin dollars was primarily the result of higher sales volume in the third quarter of 2024, including royalty revenue, with the decrease in gross margin percentage primarily attributable to unfavorable product mix and higher supply chain costs, including increased freight-in and tariff spending of 1,153,000 (net of approximately 56,000 in duty drawback recovery in the third quarter of 2024 and 662,000 in duty drawback recovery in the second quarter of 2024 of previously paid tariffs) offset by production efficiencies. 

Backlog, which represents the total value of orders for products for which shipment is scheduled within the next 12 months, was approximately 150,590,000 at the end of the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 153,794,000 at the end of the second quarter of 2024. 

Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 2,199,000, or 5.2 , to 40,358,000 from 42,557,000 for the second quarter of 2024. Litigation-contingency expense related to the litigation with SynQor, Inc. ("SynQor") was 0 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2,300,000 for the second quarter of 2024. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the litigation with SynQor. 

We reported net income for the third quarter of 2024 of 11,552,000, or 0.26 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of (1,196,000), or (0.03) per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2024. 

For the third quarter of 2024, depreciation and amortization totaled 4,741,000 and capital additions totaled 8,455,000 as compared to depreciation and amortization of 4,661,000 and capital additions of 6,141,000 for the second quarter of 2024. 

Inventories decreased by approximately 3,323,000, or 3.0 , to 105,761,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to 109,084,000 at June 30, 2024. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were 93,166,000, a decrease of 14,678,000, or 13.6 , as compared to 107,844,000 for the third quarter of 2023. Net revenues, by product line, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

The decrease in net revenues for Advanced Products was primarily due to continued softness in underpenetrated markets, partially offset by increased royalty revenue in the quarter. The decrease in net revenues for Brick Products was primarily due to reduced market demand. 
 Gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 10,134,000, or 18.1 , to 45,744,000, from 55,878,000 for the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenues, decreased to 49.1 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 51.8 for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in gross margin dollars and gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to lower sales volume and unfavorable sales mix on that volume, offset by higher royalty revenue and improved production efficiencies and supply chain costs, including lower freight-in and tariff spending of 430,000 (net of approximately 56,000 in duty drawback recovery in the third quarter of 2024 and 0 in duty drawback recovery in the third quarter of 2023 of previously paid tariffs). 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 23,398,000 for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 976,000, or 4.4 , from 22,422,000 for the third quarter of 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 25.1 for the third quarter of 2024 from 20.8 for the third quarter of 2023.

Our exposure to market risk fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to the operations of Vicor Japan Company, Ltd. VJCL ), for which the functional currency is the Japanese Yen, and all other subsidiaries in Europe and Asia, for which the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. These subsidiaries in Europe and Asia experienced favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company. 
 Income before income taxes was 9,099,000 for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 17,621,000 for the third quarter of 2023.

 VICOR CORPORATION Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations September 30, 2024 

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company calculated the income tax provision using the discrete method as this was more appropriate given the facts and circumstances. The Company determined that the application of the estimated annual effective tax rate method generally required by FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, results in a disproportionate tax provision (benefit) for income taxes for the quarter relative to the expected provision for the full year. 
 The effective tax rates differ from the statutory tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily due to the Company s full valuation allowance position against domestic deferred tax assets. The (benefit) provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included estimated federal, state and foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which the Company does not have sufficient tax attributes. 
 
 The Company s tax expense and rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 continues to be negatively impacted by the capitalization of research and development expenses under Section 174 in the U.S., which given the Company s close to breakeven performance, is having an outsized impact on the rate by effectively moving from a book loss to a taxable income position, which causes a significant tax expense. This is further compounded by the Company not recording a deferred tax benefit from temporary differences due to the full valuation allowance on domestic deferred tax assets. 
 See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure regarding our current assessment of the valuation allowance against all domestic deferred tax assets, and the possible release (i.e., reduction) of the allowance in the future. 
 We reported net income for the third quarter of 2024 of 11,552,000, or 0.26 per diluted share, compared to net income of 16,582,000, or 0.37 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 262,892,000, a decrease of 49,515,000, or 15.8 , from 312,407,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The decrease in net revenues for Advanced Products was primarily due to continued softness in underpenetrated markets, partially offset by increased royalty revenue. The decrease in net revenues for Brick Products was primarily due to reduced market demand. 
 Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 23,947,000, or 15.2 , to 133,638,000 from 157,585,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenues, increased to 50.8 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 50.4 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross margin dollars was primarily the result of lower sales volume in the first nine months of 2024, with the increase in gross margin percentage primarily attributable to higher royalty revenue and improved production efficiencies compared to the first nine months of 2023 along with certain reductions in supply chain costs, including a reduction of 2,108,000 in outsourced manufacturing costs partially offset by incremental costs of bringing production in-house for certain Advanced Products, offset by slightly unfavorable sales mix and an increase in freight-in and tariff spending of 1,502,000 (net of approximately 717,000 in duty drawback recovery in the first nine months of 2024 and 5,715,000 in duty drawback recovery in the first nine months of 2023 of previously paid tariffs). 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 72,715,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 9,695,000, or 15.4 , compared to 63,020,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Our exposure to market risk fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to the operations of VJCL, for which the functional currency is the Japanese Yen, and all other subsidiaries in Europe and Asia, for which the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. These subsidiaries in Europe and Asia experienced less unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company. 
 (Loss) income before income taxes was (1,271,000) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 49,652,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 

2024 

2023 

Provision for income taxes 

2,832 

4,716 

Effective income tax rate 

(222.8) 

9.5 

The effective tax rates differ from the statutory tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily due to the Company s full valuation allowance position against domestic deferred tax assets. The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included estimated federal, state and foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which the Company does not have sufficient tax attributes. 
 
 The Company's tax expense and the rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 continues to be negatively impacted by the capitalization of research and development expenses under Section 174 in the U.S., which given the Company's nine month performance, is having an outsized impact on the rate by effectively moving from a book loss to a taxable income position, which causes a significant tax expense. This is further compounded by the Company not getting a deferred tax benefit from temporary differences due to the full valuation allowance on domestic deferred tax assets. 
 See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure regarding our current assessment of the valuation allowance against all domestic deferred tax assets, and the possible release (i.e., reduction) of the allowance in the future. 
 We reported a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of (4,117,000), or (0.09) per diluted share, as compared to net income of 44,927,000, or 1.00 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 267,605,000 in cash and cash equivalents. The ratio of total current assets to total current liabilities was 6.4:1 as of September 30, 2024 and 9.5:1 as of December 31, 2023. Working capital, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, increased 4,256,000 to 380,453,000 as of September 30, 2024 from 376,197,000 as of December 31, 2023.

The primary sources of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 40,725,000 generated from operations and 7,047,000 received in connection with the exercise of options to purchase our Common Stock awarded under our stock option plans and the issuance of Common Stock under our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The primary uses of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were for the purchase of property and equipment of 21,866,000. 
 In November 2000, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 30,000,000 of our Common Stock (the November 2000 Plan ). In July 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100,000,000 of our Common Stock (the New Repurchase Authorization ). The New Repurchase Authorization replaces the November 2000 Plan in its entirety and no further repurchases will be made pursuant to the November 2000 Plan. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 99,503,000 remaining available for repurchases of our Common Stock under the New Repurchase Authorization. 
 The timing and amounts of Common Stock repurchases under the New Repurchase Authorization are at the discretion of the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer based upon economic and financial market conditions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of approximately 14,073,000 of cancelable and non-cancelable capital expenditure commitments, principally for manufacturing and production equipment, which we intend to fund with existing cash, and approximately 2,976,000 of capital expenditure items and internal-use software which had been received and included in Property, plant and equipment, net in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, but not yet paid for. Our primary needs for liquidity are for making continuing investments in manufacturing and production equipment. We believe cash generated from operations together with our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund planned operational needs and capital equipment purchases, for both the short and long term. 
 We do not consider the impact of inflation or fluctuations in the exchange rates for foreign currency transactions to have been significant during the last three fiscal years.

 Item 3 Quantitative and Qu alitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents, our short-term investments and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments consist principally of cash accounts, money market securities, and U.S. Treasury securities, which are short-term in nature, we believe our exposure to market risk on interest rate fluctuations for these investments is not significant. As of September 30, 2024, our long-term investment portfolio, recorded on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as Long-term investment, net , consisted of a single auction rate security with a par value of 3,000,000, purchased through and held in custody by a broker-dealer affiliate of Bank of America, N.A., that has experienced failed auctions (the Failed Auction Security since February 2008. While the Failed Auction Security is Aaa/AA+ rated by major credit rating agencies, collateralized by student loans and guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education under the Federal Family Education Loan Program, continued failure to sell at its periodic auction dates (i.e., reset dates) could negatively impact the carrying value of the investment, in turn leading to impairment charges in future periods. Periodic changes in the fair value of the Failed Auction Security attributable to credit loss (i.e., risk of the issuer s default) are recorded through earnings as a component of Other income (expense), net , with the remainder of any periodic change in fair value not related to credit loss (i.e., temporary mark-to-market carrying value adjustments) recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss , a component of Stockholders Equity. Should we conclude a decline in the fair value of the Failed Auction Security is other than temporary, such losses would be recorded through earnings as a component of Other income (expense), net . We do not believe there was an other-than-temporary decline in value in this security as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our exposure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to the operations of VJCL, for which the functional currency is the Japanese Yen, and changes in the relative value of the Yen to the U.S. Dollar. The functional currency of all other subsidiaries in Europe and other subsidiaries in Asia is the U.S. Dollar. While we believe the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for these subsidiaries is generally not significant, they can be subject to substantial currency changes, and therefore foreign exchange exposures.

 Item 4 Contr ols and Procedures 
 (a) Disclosure regarding controls and procedures. 

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO (who is our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer CFO (who is our principal financial officer), conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the last fiscal quarter (i.e., September 30, 2024). The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our CEO and CFO concluded, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Accordingly, management, including the CEO and CFO, recognizes our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. The design of a control system must reflect the fact there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any control s effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 
 (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
