 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other sections of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 1. Overview In the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, demand was relatively healthy in the majority of our end markets with increases in our same-store tons sold compared to prior year periods. However, our operating results declined from the comparable 2023 periods, despite earnings contributions from four acquisitions completed in the first three quarters of 2024, mainly due to lower metals prices. Our same-store and total tons sold increases of 3.7 and 7.1 , respectively, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 benefited from one additional shipping day and outperformed the 1.2 decline in industry shipments reported by the Metals Service Center Institute. We believe our outperformance of industry peers is supported by our organic growth activities along with our service levels. Our third quarter of 2024 same-store net sales decreased 8.0 compared to the third quarter of 2023 as a result of a 11.4 decline in average selling price per ton sold, which was partially offset by a 3.7 increase in tons sold discussed above. Same-store net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were down 8.5 from the same period in 2023, reflecting a 9.2 decrease in average selling price per ton sold, which was partially offset by a 0.4 increase in tons sold. Declines in carbon steel product prices had the most significant impact on our selling price per ton as carbon steel product sales represent over 50 of our sales. Gross profit margins for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 29.4 and 30.1 , respectively, compared to 29.7 and 30.7 for the respective 2023 periods. Our gross profit margins remained strong, but were impacted from declines in metals pricing. We believe the declines in metals pricing was mitigated by effective inventory management, our focus on orders with quick turnaround and value-added processing. Earnings per diluted share were 3.61 and 13.55 for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 4.99 and 17.92 for the respective 2023 periods. Our lower earnings per share year-over-year are mainly due to lower metals prices despite increases in same-store and total tons sold, and share repurchases. Cash flow from operations of 956.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from 1.15 billion for the same period in 2023 mainly due to lower net income partially offset by a decrease in working capital investment. Returns to stockholders in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 1.14 billion were comprised of 951.3 million of share repurchases and 188.5 million of cash dividends. Organic growth activities were substantially comprised of capital expenditures of 319.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 358.6 million for the same period in 2023. We completed four acquisitions in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for 366.7 million. Acquisitions 2024 Acquisitions To further our growth strategy, in addition to our organic growth activities, we have completed four acquisitions so far in 2024. Our acquisition strategy enhances our product breadth and value-added processing capabilities, with a continued focus on the diversification of our products, end markets and geographies. Our 2024 acquisitions fit our strategy by extending the geographic reach of certain of our existing operations and expanding our product breadth and processing capacity.

 (1) Gross profit, calculated as net sales less cost of sales, and gross profit margin, calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, are non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude depreciation and amortization expense associated with the corresponding sales. About half of our orders are basic distribution with no processing services performed. For the remainder of our sales orders, we perform first-stage processing, which is generally not labor intensive as we are simply cutting the metal to size. Because of this, the amount of related labor and overhead, including depreciation and amortization, is not significant and is excluded from cost of sales. Therefore, our cost of sales is substantially comprised of the cost of the material we sell. We use gross profit and gross profit margin as shown above as measures of operating performance. Gross profit and gross profit margin are important operating and financial measures as their fluctuations can have a significant impact on our earnings. Gross profit and gross profit margin, as presented, are not necessarily comparable with similarly titled measures for other companies.

Our average selling price per ton sold includes intercompany transactions that are eliminated from our consolidated net sales. Same-store amounts exclude the results of our 2024 and 2023 acquisitions. Our same-store net sales declined from the comparable 2023 periods mainly due to declines in carbon steel pricing that lowered our average selling price per ton sold despite increases in same-store and total tons sold. Demand remained relatively healthy in the majority of end markets we serve supported by same-store growth in tons sold from the prior year periods. Since we primarily purchase and sell our inventories in the spot market, our average selling prices generally fluctuate with the changes in the costs of the various metals we purchase. The mix of products sold can also have an impact on our overall average selling price per ton sold. As c arbon steel sales represented 53 of our gross sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, changes in carbon steel prices have the most significant impact on changes in our overall average selling price per ton sold. The mix of our total sales by major commodity products and year-over-year changes in selling prices are presented below:

See Net Sales above for trends in both demand and costs of our products. Gross profit in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from the same periods in 2023 mainly due to lower net sales as a result of decreases in average selling price per ton sold partially offset by gross profit contributions from our acquisitions. Our gross profit margins remained strong, but were pressured from declines in metals pricing which we believe were mitigated by effective inventory management, our focus on orders with quick turnaround and value-added processing. In addition, we record in cost of sales non-cash adjustments to our LIFO method inventory valuation reserve that, in effect, reflects cost of sales at current replacement costs. The inventory caption of our consolidated balance sheet includes a LIFO method inventory valuation reserve of 429.3 million at September 30, 2024. See Net Sales above for further discussion on product pricing trends. Expenses

 by lower incentive-based compensation resulting from lower profitability. SG A expense as a percentage of sales mainly increased due to lower net sales levels. Our same-store SG A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes 5.1 million of non-recurring settlement expenses, mainly related to our anticipated withdrawal from certain multiemployer pension plans. Operating Income 

September 30, 2024 2023 of of Dollar Percentage Net Sales Net Sales Change Change (dollars in millions) Operating income (three months ended) 273.4 8.0 389.5 10.8 (116.1) (29.8) Operating income (nine months ended) 1,018.2 9.5 1,414.4 12.3 (396.2) (28.0) Operating income declined for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 as a result of lower same-store gross profit, driven by lower net sales and gross profit margin, partially offset by contributions to operating income from our acquisitions. Our operating income margins in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were lower than in the comparable 2023 periods mainly due to lower gross profit margins and decreased operating leverage of our SG A expense due to lower sales levels. See Net Sales above for discussion of trends in demand and product costs and Expenses for trends in our operating expenses. Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate for each of the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.3 , compared to 23.7 and 24.2 for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The differences between our effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 were mainly due to state income taxes. Financial Condition Operating Activities Net cash provided by operations of 956.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 189.2 million from 1.15 billion in the same period in 2023. The year-over-year decrease was mainly due to a decline of 294.7 million in net income offset by lower working capital investment. To manage our working capital, we focus on our days sales outstanding and inventory turnover rate as receivables and inventory are the two most significant elements of our working capital. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our days sales outstanding rates were 41.4 days and 40.3 days, respectively. Our inventory turnover rate (based on tons) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.6 times (or 2.6 months on hand), compared to 4.7 times (or 2.6 months on hand) for the same period in 2023. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of 673.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 305.6 million from 367.8 million in the same period in 2023. The significant increase was mainly due to 366.7 million spent on acquisitions in the 2024 nine-month period compared to 24.1 million in the same period in 2023, partially offset by 38.9 million less of capital expenditures. The majority of our capital expenditures in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were related to growth activities.

 Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities of 1.05 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 78.0 million from 970.7 million in the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly the result of increased share repurchases partially offset by increased net debt borrowings. Net debt borrowings were 125.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net debt repayments of 507.9 million in the same period in 2023, which included the redemption of 500.0 million of senior notes. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 951.3 million of our common stock compared to 239.2 million in the same period in 2023. Our returns to stockholders also included an increase in our quarterly dividend rate of 10 in February 2024 with total dividend payments of 188.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 179.3 million in the same period in 2023. On October 22, 2024, our Board of Directors declared the 2024 fourth quarter cash dividend of 1.10 per share. We have increased our quarterly dividend 31 times since our IPO in 1994, with the most recent increase of 10.0 from 1.00 to 1.10 per share effective in the first quarter of 2024. We have paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock for 65 consecutive years and have never reduced or suspended our regular quarterly dividend. Share Repurchase Plan See Note 9 Equity to our consolidated financial statements for information on our 2024 and 2023 share repurchases. On October 22, 2024, our Board of Directors amended our share repurchase program to replenish the repurchase authorization to 1.5 billion. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares, does not have a specific expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Debt On September 10, 2024, we entered into a 1.5 billion unsecured five-year Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement Credit Agreement that amended and restated our then-existing 1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with 125.0 million of outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024. We also had an aggregate of 1.15 billion principal amount of senior unsecured note obligations with various maturities through 2036 issued under indentures as of September 30, 2024 . See Note 6 Debt to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our amended credit agreement and indentures governing our debt securities. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe our primary sources of liquidity, including funds generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents and our 1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements and stockholder return activities over the next 12 months and beyond. As of September 30, 2024, we had 314.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and our net debt-to-total capital ratio was 11.5 , up from 0.8 as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had 401.4 million of debt obligations coming due before our 1.5 billion revolving credit facility matures on September 10, 2029. We believe that we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to fund our future operating needs and to repay our debt obligations as they become due . In addition to funds generated from operations and approximately 1.37 billion available under our revolving credit facility, we expect to continue to be able to access the capital markets to raise funds, if desired. We believe our investment grade credit ratings enhance our ability to effectively raise capital. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, make necessary capital expenditures, finance strategic growth through acquisitions and internal initiatives, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock.

 Covenants The Credit Agreement and indentures governing our debt securities include customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default provisions. The covenants under the Credit Agreement include, among other things, a financial maintenance covenant that requires us to comply with a maximum total net leverage ratio. We were in compliance with the financial maintenance covenant in our Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024. Seasonality Some of our customers are in seasonal businesses, especially customers in the construction industry and related businesses. However, our overall operations have not shown any material seasonal trends as a result of our geographic, product and customer diversity. Typically, revenues in the months of July, November and December have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products, resulting from holidays observed by the Company as well as vacation and extended holiday closures at some of our customers. The number of shipping days in each quarter also has an impact on our quarterly sales and profitability. We cannot predict whether period-to-period fluctuations will be consistent with historical patterns. Results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill, which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired, amounted to 2.17 billion at September 30, 2024, or approximately 21 of total assets and 29 of total equity. Additionally, other intangible assets, net amounted to 1.03 billion at September 30, 2024, or approximately 10 of total assets and 14 of total equity. Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests and further evaluation when certain events occur. Other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Critical Accounting Estimates Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. When we prepare these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Some of our accounting policies are critical due to the fact that they involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our most critical accounting estimates include those related to the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
