 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that are in some cases beyond our control and may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as anticipate, believe, contemplate, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, should, target, will or would or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following: 
 changes in our strategy, expansion plans, customer opportunities, future operations, future financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects and plans; 
 the implementation, market acceptance and success of our business model and growth strategy; 
 our ability to develop and maintain our brand and reputation; 
 developments and projections relating to our business, our competitors, and industry; 
 the impact of health epidemics on our business and the actions we may take in response thereto; 
 our expectations regarding our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection and not infringe on the rights of others; 
 expectations regarding the time during which we will be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act; 
 our future capital requirements and sources and uses of cash; 
 the international nature of our operations and the impact of war or other hostilities on our business and global markets; 
 our ability to obtain funding for our operations and future growth; and 
 our business, expansion plans and opportunities. 
 You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and operating results. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Additionally, our discussions of environmental, social, and governance ESG assessments, goals and relevant issues herein or in other locations, including our corporate website, are informed by various ESG standards and frameworks (including standards for the measurement of underlying data), and the interests of various stakeholders. References to materiality in the context of such discussions and any related assessment of ESG materiality may differ from the definition of materiality under the federal securities laws for SEC reporting purposes. Furthermore, much of this information is subject to assumptions, estimates or third-party information that is still evolving and subject to change. For example, we note that standards and expectations regarding greenhouse gas GHG accounting and the process for measuring and counting GHG emissions and GHG emissions reductions are evolving, and it is possible that our approaches both to measuring our emissions and any reductions may be at some point, either currently or in the future, considered not in keeping with best practices. In addition, our disclosures based on any standards may change due to revisions in framework requirements, availability or quality of information, changes in our business or applicable government policies, or other factors, some of which may be beyond our control. 
 In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we believe that information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant

 information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. Any forward-looking statements only speak as of the date of this document, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking information or statements, whether written or oral, to reflect any change, except as required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements.

NOTE 1. 
 
 NOTE 2. 
 Principles of Consolidation 
 
 Emerging Growth Company 
 Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. 
 This may make comparison of the Company s consolidated financial statement with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

Asset impairment relates to the write-off of leasehold improvements in the Company s Westlake Village office due to the Company relocating its corporate office. The loss on sale of assets relates to the sale of a cement plant at the Company s R D site in Switzerland. The Company did recognize any impairments or loss on sale of assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The increases in machinery and equipment and construction in progress primarily relate to a commercial demonstration unit being constructed in Snyder, Texas Snyder CDU ), a battery energy storage system BESS being constructed in Snyder Texas Cross Trails BESS ), and a hybrid energy storage system being constructed in Calistoga, California. 
 In December 2023, the Company paid million to acquire the land that the Snyder CDU will be located on and other related assets. At the time of the purchase, the Company intended to resell the land that would not be used for the Snyder CDU and all of the other related assets. As such, the Company recorded million of the purchase price as assets held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company decided it would keep the assets that were initially classified as held for sale and instead develop the Cross Trails BESS, a 56.9 MW/113.8 MWh BESS. As such, the Company reclassified the property and equipment from assets held for sale to construction in progress in June 2024.

 The Company issues market-based RSUs that vest upon the Company s stock reaching certain price targets. For these RSUs, the Company determines fair value by using a Monte Carlo simulation, which involves random iterations that take different future price paths over the RSU s contractual life based on appropriate probability distributions (which are based on commonly applied Black-Scholes inputs). The fair value of each market-based RSU is determined by taking the average grant date fair value under each Monte Carlo simulation trial. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the derived service period and there is no ongoing adjustment or reversal based on actual achievement during the vesting period.

The discussion should be read together with our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the respective notes thereto, and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. The discussion and analysis should also be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements, the respective notes thereto, and other financial information included elsewhere in the Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed by us with the SEC on March 13, 2024. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon Energy Vault s current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Energy Vault s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. You should review the section titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of forward-looking statements and the section titled Risk Factors, for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Energy Vault s historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Quarterly Report to we, our, us, the Company, or Energy Vault refer to Energy Vault Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries both prior to the consummation of and following the Merger (as defined below). 
 
 Our Business 
 Energy Vault develops and deploys utility-scale energy storage solutions designed to aid in the global transition to a clean energy future. 
 Our Company s comprehensive offerings include proprietary gravity, battery, and green hydrogen energy storage solutions, supported by our technology-agnostic energy management software solutions. We incorporate a customer-centric, solutions-based approach toward helping utilities, independent power producers, and large industrial energy users reduce their energy costs while maintaining power reliability. As the world transitions to an economy powered by increasingly intermittent renewable energy such as solar and wind, the ability to provide clean and affordable electricity to a growing global population will depend heavily on the ability to store and distribute energy at appropriate times. We are striving to create a world powered by renewable resources so that everyone will have access to clean, sustainable, and affordable energy. 
 Our solutions are designed to address the intermittency issues inherent in the predominant sources of renewable energy production by storing energy produced when renewable energy production is active. Once energy is stored in our solutions, it can be discharged to the grid in a controlled and reliable manner at any time, regardless of the then current ability of the renewable sources to generate power. Our energy storage solutions are designed to accommodate a wide variety of renewable power sources and to achieve an attractive levelized cost of energy relative to fossil fuels. Collectively, these abilities greatly broaden the use cases and time duration scenarios that can be addressed by certain sources of renewable power. 
 
 Key Factors and Trends Affecting our Business 
 We believe that our performance and future success depend upon several factors that present significant opportunities for us, but also pose risks and challenges including those discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 13, 2024. 
 Product Development and Deployment Plan 
 We leverage our sustainable and differentiated technologies to provide our customers with economical solutions to meet their short, long, and extended-duration renewable energy storage needs. Our energy storage solutions are designed to accommodate a wide variety of renewable power sources and to achieve an attractive levelized cost of energy relative to fossil fuels. 
 We anticipate that our market will be characterized by high growth and rapidly evolving use cases and requirements. We believe that the majority of our competitors are primarily focused on the development and marketing of vertically siloed solutions based on a singular energy storage technology. Alternatively, we have strategically chosen to design an agile and agnostic software platform that can orchestrate the management of not just one energy storage technology, but rather one or more of our diverse storage mediums and the underlying power generation assets to harmonize asset operation and drive competitive operational performance. We expect that this will broaden the use cases and time duration scenarios that can be

 addressed by certain sources of renewable power, and thereby drive a faster transition to more widespread utilization of renewable power. 
 Our range of energy storage solutions assures our customers have what they need today, as well as what they will need in the future, thereby protecting their investments in our products within this high-growth market and its rapidly evolving use cases and requirements. For these reasons, we believe we are well positioned to compete successfully in the evolving market for energy storage solutions. 
 We primarily rely on two models for project delivery, which are (i) engineering, procurement, and construction EPC delivery and (ii) engineered equipment EEQ delivery. Under the EPC model, we generally rely on third-party EPC firms to construct our storage systems, under our supervision with dedicated teams tasked with project management. Under the EEQ model, we are responsible for the delivery and installation of the equipment we provide, as well as resolving issues within our scope of supply. 
 Our cost projections are heavily dependent upon raw materials (such as steel), equipment (such as motors, batteries, inverters, and power electronic devices) and technical and construction service providers (such as engineering, procurement, construction firms). The global supply chain, on which Energy Vault relies, has been significantly impacted by (i) economic uncertainties, including the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, and (ii) high inflation pressure on project budgeting resulting in potential significant delays and cost fluctuations, particularly with respect to lithium, transformers, inverters, motors, microchips and many other raw materials that are within the motor and power electronic supply chains. These future timing and financial developments may impact Energy Vault s performance from both a deployment and cost perspective. 
 Energy Storage Industry 
 We believe climate change poses a monumental risk to humanity and decreasing human generated GHG emissions is currently among the world s most pressing challenges. Carbon dioxide is the primary GHG emitted through human activities and, according to the International Energy Agency, the energy sector is estimated to account for more than 75 of global human generated GHG emissions. Burning fossil fuels contributes to climate change by releasing carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. 
 Renewable energy sources present environmental advantages over fossil fuels in terms of finite natural resource usage and GHG emission profile. A major obstacle to transitioning to renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar is the intermittent availability of these types of energy sources. Energy storage solutions are needed to balance the production intermittency of variable renewable energy to support a clean-energy future and a balanced electrical grid infrastructure. 
 The growth of the energy storage market that we address is primarily driven by the decreasing cost of energy storage technologies and renewable power generation sources, government mandates, financial incentives to reduce GHG emissions, and increasing geopolitical pressures driving energy independence goals. These dynamics are driving demand for additional renewable power generation and increased capacity and storage duration in energy storage solutions. 
 According to the 2H 2023 Energy Storage Market Outlook published by BloombergNEF in October 2023, the energy storage market is expected to grow at a 27 compound annual growth rate through 2030, with annual additions reaching 110 GW/372 GWh, or 2.6 times expected 2023 gigawatt installations. Both government mandates and companies focused on reducing energy use, cost, and emissions are expected to propel the shift to renewable sources of power. 
 Our business depends on the acceptance of our energy storage products in the marketplace. Even if renewable energy and energy storage become more widely adopted than they have been to date, potential customers may choose energy storage products from our competitors. 
 Increasing Deployment of Renewable Energy 
 Deployment of renewable energy resources has accelerated over the last decade, and solar and wind have become low cost energy sources. Energy storage is critical to reducing the intermittency and volatility of renewable energy generation. However, there is no guarantee that the deployment of renewable energy will occur at the rate that is expected. Inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical stresses, and other factors could result in fluctuations in demand for and deployment of renewable energy resources, adversely affecting our revenue and ability to generate profits in the future. 
 Competition 
 The market for our products is competitive, and we may face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce energy storage solutions and components. Furthermore, as we expand our services and digital applications in the future, we may face other competitors including software providers and hardware manufacturers that offer software solutions. If our market share declines due to increased competition or if we are not able to compete as we expect, our revenue and ability to generate profits in the future may be adversely affected.

 Inflation 
 In the markets in which we operate, there have been higher rates of inflation in recent years. If inflation continues to increase in our markets, it may increase our expenses that we may not be able to pass through to customers. It may also increase the costs of our products that could negatively impact their competitiveness. 
 Government Regulation and Compliance 
 Governments in countries throughout the world have announced and implemented various policies, regulations, and legislation to support the transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon form of energy, including through the use of energy storage solutions. For example, in August 2022, the United States Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act IRA ). The IRA provides incentives for the domestic manufacturing of key components of energy storage solutions as well as the construction of standalone energy storage projects. The resulting improved economics are expected to reduce the cost to implement storage within the domestic market and may amplify and accelerate the adoption of energy storage systems for short, long, and extended duration use cases, like those offered by Energy Vault. Such government policies and programs are becoming increasingly instrumental in stimulating adoption of energy storage solutions across different markets through a variety of methods, including by providing financial support, facilitating grid integration, and supporting research and development. 
 Although we are not regulated as a utility, federal, state, and local government statutes and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence the market for our products and services. These statutes and regulations often relate to electricity pricing, net metering, incentives, taxation, competition with utilities and the interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. In the United States, governments continuously modify these statutes and regulations. Governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt different rates for commercial customers on a regular basis. These changes could affect our ability to deliver cost savings to our current and future customers for the purchase of electricity. We believe we are well positioned to capture incentives contained in the IRA and that its enactment is favorable to our business and future operations. However, as this legislation was recently adopted and applicable U.S. Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service guidelines were published in the third quarter of 2023, we have not yet seen the impact these IRA incentives may have on our business, operations, and financial performance in the future and cannot guarantee that we will realize the anticipated benefits from the incentives in the IRA. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 In June 2024, the Company executed an engineer, procure, and construct contract with a customer to build a 200 MW/400 MWh BESS in Australia. Additionally, the Company signed a maintenance agreement with this customer to provide maintenance services on the BESS after construction is completed. 
 In June 2024, the Company implemented a series of cost savings measures, expected to result in realized cost savings of 6.0 million to 8.0 million annually. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized reorganization costs of 1.7 million, consisting of personnel reduction costs, related to these cost saving measures. 
 On September 13, 2024, the Company was notified by the NYSE that it was not in compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of the Company s Common Stock was less than 1.00 over a consecutive 30 t rading-day period. The notice did not result in the immediate delisting of the Company s Common Stock from the NYSE. On November 1, 2024, the Company received written notice from the NYSE informing the Company that it had regained compliance with the bid price rule as of October 31, 2024. 
 In October 2024 the Company executed an equipment supply contract with a customer and in November 2024 the Company executed an offtake agreement for the Cross Trails BESS with another customer. The equipment supply contract is for a fixed price and the offtake agreement includes both fixed and variable price components. The aggregate expected future revenue from these contracts, including variable fees that the Company believes is probable, is 90.7 million. The variable revenues are forecasted by an independent third-party firm using simulation software that factors in current and projected energy market dynamics, historical and forecasted volatility, and location specific data. The Company considers the low-end simulation results to be probable. 
 On November 12, 2024, the Company entered into an open market sales agreement (the Sales Agreement with Jefferies LLC, as sales agent (the sales agent ), pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, sell shares of its common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 50.0 million through the sales agent. The Company is not obligated to, and cannot provide any assurances that it will, make any sales of its shares under the Sales Agreement. 
 Upon delivery of a placement notice and subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, the sales agent may sell the shares by methods deemed to be an at-the-market offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, the sales agent will use commercially

 (1) In October 2024 the Company executed an equipment supply contract and in November 2024 the Company executed an offtake contract with two different customers with aggregate expected future revenue of 90.7 million/314 MWh. Prior to executing the equipment supply agreement, the Company and the customer were operating under a limited notice to proceed with a price of 3.0 million, which has already been included in bookings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and in backlog as of September 30, 2024. 
 (2) Developed pipeline is a new key operating metric that the Company began tracking during the second quarter of 2024, therefore prior period comparable figures have not been included. 
 (3) The Company changed its definition of backlog during the second quarter of 2024, therefore the Company has presented the comparable amounts as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 per the new definition. 
 Bookings 
 Bookings represent the total aggregate contract value and total MWhs to be delivered from customer contracts signed during the period, net of the total aggregate value and total MWhs of contracts that were cancelled during the period. The aggregate contract value includes any potential future variable payments from tolling and offtake arrangements that the Company believes is probable of being realized. Probable future variable payments are forecasted by an independent third-party firm using simulation software that factors in current and projected energy market dynamics, historical and forecasted volatility, and location specific data. The Company considers the low-end simulation results to be probable. Potential future intellectual property IP royalties are not included in bookings. Due to the long-term nature of our contracts, bookings are a key metric that allows us to understand and evaluate the growth of our Company and our estimated future revenue related to our customer contracts. 
 Developed Pipeline 
 Developed pipeline represents uncontracted, potential revenue, from projects in which potential prospective customers have either awarded a project to the Company, or have put the Company on a shortlist to be awarded a project. Developed pipeline is an internal management metric that we construct using information from our global sales team and is monitored by management to understand the potential anticipated growth of our Company and to estimate potential future revenue. Developed pipeline is influenced by the prevailing foreign exchange rates and equipment prices and may vary from period to period if these inputs change. 
 Developed pipeline may not generate margins equal to our historical operating results. We have only recently begun to track our developed pipeline on a consistent basis as a performance measure, and as a result, we do not have significant

 experience in determining the level of realization that we may achieve on these potential contracts. Our customers may experience project delays or cancel orders as a result of external market factors and economic or other factors beyond our control. 
 Backlog 
 Backlog represents contracted but unrecognized revenue from projects and services yet to be completed, unrecognized revenue or other income from IP licensing agreements, and unrecognized revenue from tolling arrangements. Backlog includes any potential future variable payments from tolling and offtake arrangements that the Company believes is probable of being realized. Probable future variable payments are forecasted by an independent third-party firm using simulation software that factors in current and projected energy market dynamics, historical and forecasted volatility, and location specific data. The Company considers the low-end simulation results to be probable. Potential future intellectual property IP royalties are not included in backlog. Backlog is a common measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not, however, be comparable to the methodologies used by others. Effective in the second quarter of 2024, we updated our methodology for computing backlog. Under our previous methodology, our backlog was equivalent to our remaining performance obligations under GAAP. We believe our new methodology for computing backlog allows us to better evaluate the growth of our Company and estimate future revenue. 
 We cannot guarantee that our backlog will result in actual revenue in the originally anticipated period, or at all. Our customers may experience project delays or cancel orders as a result of external market factors and economic or other factors beyond our control. If our backlog fails to result in revenue as anticipated or in a timely manner, we could experience a reduction in revenue, profitability, and liquidity. 
 
 Key Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 The Company generates revenue from the sale of our energy storage solutions, the licensing of the Company s software solutions and intellectual property, and from long-term service agreements to maintain customer owned energy systems. To date, the Company has primarily generated revenue from the sale of our BESSs and from licensing our EVx technology. In addition to these sources of revenue, in the future we expect to generate revenue from the sale of our GESSs and through tolling arrangements in connection with energy storage systems that we intend to own and operate. 
 When the Company sells a BESS, the Company recognizes revenue over time as we transfer control of our product to the customer. When the Company licenses its intellectual property, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the customer obtains control of the licensed technology. When the Company licenses its software solutions or provides maintenance services, the transaction price for each contract is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. 
 Our revenue is affected by changes in the price, volume, and mix of products and services purchased by our customers, which is driven by the demand of our products, geographic mix of our customers, strength of competitor s product offerings, and the availability of government incentives to the end-users of our products. 
 Our revenue growth is dependent on continued growth in the number of energy storage systems constructed each year and our ability to increase our share of demand in the geographic regions where we currently compete and plan to compete in the future. Additionally, our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to continue to develop and commercialize new and innovative products to meet our customers energy storage needs. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue primarily consists of product costs, including purchased materials and supplies, as well as costs related to subcontractors, direct labor, and product warranties. 
 Our cost of revenue is affected by underlying costs of materials such as batteries, inverters, enclosures, transformers, and cables, as well as the cost of subcontractors to provide construction services. We do not currently hedge against changes in the price of raw materials as we do not purchase raw materials. We purchase energy storage system components from our suppliers. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin 
 Gross profit and gross profit margin may vary from period to period due to the timing of transferring control of significant uninstalled materials to customers under contracts to sell energy storage systems. When control of significant uninstalled materials is transferred to customers, the Company recognizes revenue in an amount equal to the cost of those materials. The profit margin inherent in these materials is deferred until the Company fulfills its obligation to install the materials 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 during construction of the energy storage systems. As a result, gross profit and gross profit margin will vary from period to period depending on the timing of revenue recognition related to uninstalled materials. 
 Additionally, gross profit and gross profit margin may vary from period to period due to our sales volume, product prices, product costs, product mix, geographical mix, along with the timing of when we perform installation and construction services. 
 Sales and Marketing S M Expenses 
 S M expenses consist primarily of internal personnel-related costs for marketing, sales, and related support teams, as well as external costs such as professional service fees, trade shows, marketing and sales-related promotional materials, public relations expenses, website operating and maintenance costs. Personnel-related expenses include salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expenses. 
 Research and Development R D Expenses 
 R D expenses consist primarily of internal and external expenses incurred in connection with our research activities and development programs that include materials costs directly related to product development, testing and evaluation costs, construction costs including labor and transportation of material, overhead related costs and other direct expenses consisting of personnel-related expenses and consulting expenses relating to study of product safety, reliability and development. Personnel-related expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense. 
 General and Administrative G A Expenses 
 G A expenses consist of information technology expenses, legal and professional fees, travel costs, and personnel-related expenses for our corporate, executive, finance, and other administrative functions, including expenses for professional and contract services. Personnel-related expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense. To a lesser extent, general and administrative expenses include investor relations costs, insurance costs, rent, office expenses, maintenance costs, and the provision for credit losses. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense consists of costs associated with property and equipment, and amortization of intangibles. We expect to invest in additional property, equipment, and other assets as we construct and own energy storage systems, which will result in additional depreciation expense in the future. 
 Asset Impairment and Loss on Sale of Assets 
 Asset impairment and loss on sale of assets consists of losses associated with the write-down or sale of property and equipment. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists of interest income from our money market funds, interest-bearing savings accounts, customer financing receivable, and convertible note receivable.

 Revenue 
 The Company recognized revenue for the product and service categories as follows for the t hree and nine mon ths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Sale of energy storage products (1) 
 811 172,139 11,494 222,943 Operation and maintenance services 273 818 Software licensing 115 301 Intellectual property licensing 115 Other 66 364 Total revenue 1,199 172,205 12,728 223,307 __________________ 
 (1) Includes revenue from the build and transfer of energy storage systems and from the sale of spare parts for energy storage systems. Revenue from the sale of spare parts was included within Other in prior periods. 0.3 million in revenue from the sale of spare parts reported within the Other line for the three months ended March 31, 2024 has been included within Sale of energy storage products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 171.0 million to 1.2 million compared to 172.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 210.6 million to 12.7 million compared to 223.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from the sale of energy storage products due to a reduction in revenue from the build and transfer of BESS projects. Partially offsetting the decrease in revenue from the sale of energy storage products was revenue from operation and maintenance services, software licensing, and intellectual property licensing. The revenue from providing operation and maintenance services and software licensing are new revenue streams for the Company in 2024, and are from customers that previously purchased BESSs. The Company began providing these services to the customers upon substantial completion of their BESSs. 
 Revenue from two customers accounted for 51 and 35 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and revenue from two customers accounted for 67 and 18 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 2024. Re venue from two customers accounted for 59 and 38 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and revenue from three customers accounted for 47 , 33 , and 20 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 164.3 million to 0.7 million compared to 165.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 200.7 million to 9.1 million compared to 209.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of revenue decreased due to the Company s BESS projects in progress during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 being in their later stages, compared to the projects being in earlier stages during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit was 0.5 million and 3.6 million, respectively and gross profit margin was 40.3 and 28.3 , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, gross profit was 7.1 million and 13.5 million, respectively, and gross profit margin was 4.2 and 6.1 , respectively. 
 The decrease in gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from the sale of energy storage projects due to the Company s BESS projects being in their later stages in 2024. Additionally, gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was negatively impacted by a 1.4 million increase in warranty expenses compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The increase in gross profit margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to higher margins from the sale of energy storage products, and the introduction of higher margin operation and maintenance services and software licensing in 2024. The higher margins from the sale of energy storage products in 2024 was due to the Company s BESS projects being in their later stages when higher margin construction activities occur, compared to 2023 when the BESS projects were in their earlier stages when lower margin equipment deliveries occur. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 0.2 million to 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a 0.1 million increase in personnel-related expenses and a 0.2 million increase in consulting costs. These increases were partially offset by a 0.1 million decrease in marketing and public relations costs. 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 0.2 million to 13.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 0.3 million decrease in personnel-related expenses and a 0.2 million decrease in marketing and public relations costs. These decreases were partially offset by a 0.2 million increase in consulting costs. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 2.5 million to 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 1.4 million decrease in personnel-related expenses, a 0.8 million decrease in software expenses, and a 0.5 million decrease in engineering costs. These cost decreases were primarily attributable to a focus on cost controls and a reduction in headcount. These cost decreases were partially offset by a 0.1 million increase in consulting costs. 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 9.9 million to 19.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 29.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 5.1 million decrease in personnel-related expenses, a 3.1 million decrease in engineering costs, and a 1.8 million decrease in software expenses. The cost decreases were primarily attributable to a focus on cost controls and a reduction in headcount. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 1.5 million to 17.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a 1.9 million increase in the provision for credit losses and a 0.4 million increase in legal and professional fees. These 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 increases were partially offset by a 0.3 million decrease in personnel-related expenses, a 0.3 million decrease in consulting costs, and a 0.3 million decrease in software expenses. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 3.4 million to 48.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 52.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 4.5 million decrease in personnel-related expenses, a 0.9 million decrease in software expenses, and a 0.4 million decrease in consulting costs. The cost decreases were primarily attributable to a focus on cost controls and a reduction in headcount. These cost decreases were partially offset by a 2.0 million increase in the provision for credit losses and a 0.3 million increase in legal and professional fees. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 16 thousand to 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to 0.1 million in amortization costs related to the Company s capitalized software. Certain capitalized software products were placed into service effective January 1, 2024, resulting in 0.1 million in amortization expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024. There was no comparable expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 0.2 million to 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to 0.3 million in amortization costs related to the Company s capitalized software. Certain capitalized software products were placed into service effective January 1, 2024, resulting in 0.3 million in amortization expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There was no comparable expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Asset Impairment and Loss on Sale of Assets 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, asset impairments and loss on sale of assets was nominal . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, asset impairment and loss on sale of assets totaled 0.6 million, comprised of 0.5 million in asset impairments and 0.1 million in loss on sale of assets. Asset impairment relates to the write-off of leasehold improvements in the Company s Westlake Village office due to the Company relocating its corporate office. The loss on sale of assets relates to the sale of a cement plant at the Company s R D site in Switzerland. The Company did not recognize any impairments or loss on sale of assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income decreased by 0.5 million to 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and interest income decreased by 1.1 million to 5.0 million compared to 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to a decrease in interest income from our money market funds. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other expense, net increased by 0.9 million to 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other expense, net is primarily due to a 0.8 million loss due to the change in the fair value of the Company s derivative asset - conversion option due to a decrease in the probability of the Company exercising its conversion option in DG Fuels, LLC DG Fuels ). 
 Other income (expense), net improved by 1.0 million to other income, net of 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other expense, net of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement in other income (expense), net is primarily due to a 1.5 million gain resulting from the derecognition of a contract liability with a related party during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In 2019, the Company received a 1.5 million deposit for a gravity-based system from a customer that was owned by one of its primary shareholders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company concluded it was no longer obligated to provide a gravity-based system to the customer and that the deposit was nonrefundable. As a result, the Company derecognized the 1.5 million liability and recognized it as a gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There was no such comparable gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Partially offsetting this gain was a 0.8 million loss due to the change in the fair value of the Company s derivative asset - conversion option due to a decrease in the probability of the Company exercising its conversion option in DG Fuels.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Since inception , we have financed our net cash used in operating and investing activities primarily through the issuance and sale of equity, and with the proceeds from the reverse recapitalization and private investment in public equity that occurred in 2022. 
 Energy Vault has incurred negative operating cash flows and operating losses in the past and we may incur operating losses in the future. We may seek additional capital through equity and/or debt financings depending on market conditions. If we are required to raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders would result. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of common stock. The terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The credit market and financial services industry have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of uncertainty that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing. 
 M anagement believes that its cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on hand as of the filing date of this Quarterly Report will be sufficient to fund our operating activities for at least the next twelve months without regard to any cash proceeds we may receive in the future upon the exercise of our private warrants. 
 The exercise price for our private warrants is 11.50 per warrant, subject to certain specified adjustments. To the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds 11.50 per share, it is more likely that our private warrant holders will exercise their warrants. To the extent that the price of our common stock declines, including a decline below 11.50 per share, it is less likely that our private warrant holders will exercise their warrants. 
 On November 12, we entered into a open market sales agreement with Jefferies LLC, as sales agent (the sales agent ), pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 50.0 million through the sales agent under an at-the-market equity offering program. Any offer and sale of shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement will be made pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-273089), which was declared effective by the SEC on July 20, 2023, and the related prospectus supplement dated November 12, 2024 and accompanying prospectus that form a part of the registration statement. 
 The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (amounts in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 51,124 109,923 Restricted cash 26,560 35,632 Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 77,684 145,555 
 Our cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturities of three months or less. Substantially all of our restricted cash balance is held by banks as collateral for the Company s letters of credit. 
 Licensing Agreements with Extended Payment Terms 
 The Company has licensed its gravity storage technology and certain of these agreements contain extended payment terms. There is uncertainty as to the collectability of the license payments in certain licensing agreements, and the Company has not yet recognized any revenue related to those license agreements where collectability is uncertain.

Our non-cancellable purchase obligations as of September 30, 2024 totaled approxim ate ly 2.0 million. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (21,040) (116,050) Net cash used in investing activities (48,085) (33,182) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 565 (4,655) Effects of exchange rate changes on cash 689 (73) Net decrease in cash (67,871) (153,960) 
 Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash used in operating activities totaled 21.0 million and 116.1 million, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating cash flows were negatively impacted by a net loss of 74.0 million and a decrease in operating liabilities of 53.1 million. The decrease in operating liabilities was primarily attributable to a 55.5 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a 1.0 million decrease in other long-term liabilities, partially offset by a 3.5 million increase in deferred revenue. Operating cash flows were positively impacted by a 73.0 million decrease in operating assets and non-cash charges of 33.0 million. The decrease in operating assets was primarily attributable to a 56.9 million decrease in contract assets, a 24.6 million decrease in accounts receivable, and a 1.5 million decrease in customer financing receivable. The decrease in contract assets and accounts receivable was due to the Company s BESS projects being in their final stages and the Company having collected most of the remaining balances due. The non-cash charges were primarily composed of 29.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, a 2.2 million provision for credit losses, 0.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense, 0.8 million in change in fair value of derivative asset - conversion option, 0.6 million in asset impairments and loss on sale of assets, and 0.3 million in foreign exchange losses, partially offset by 1.2 million in non-cash interest income. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities of 116.1 million was negatively impacted by a net loss of 76.3 million, an increase in operating assets of 2.9 million, and a decrease in operating liabilities of 71.5 million. The increase in operating assets was primarily due to a 36.8 million increase in contract assets, partially offset by a 21.7 million decrease in advances to suppliers and a 10.6 million decrease in accounts receivable. The increase in contract assets was primarily due to an increase in unbilled receivables on the Company s BESS projects. Advances to suppliers decreased during the period as the Company received the BESS equipment that related to the deposits, and accounts receivable decreased due to the timing of billings and cash collections. The decrease in operating liabilities was primarily due to a 44.8 million decrease in deferred revenue and a 25.8 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The decrease in deferred revenue primarily resulted from the recognition of revenue associated with the beginning deferred revenue balance on the Company s BESS projects. Operating cash flows were 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 positively impacted by non-cash charges of 34.7 million, which was primarily due to 34.5 million in stock-based compensation expense. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash used in investing activities totaled 48.1 million and 33.2 million, respectively. 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 48.3 million for the purchase of property and equipment, primarily related to the construction of the Snyder CDU, Cross Trails BESS, and the hybrid energy storage system being constructed in Calistoga, California, partially offset by 0.2 million in proceeds from the sale of a cement plant at the Company s R D site in Switzerland. 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 27.2 million for the purchase of property and equipment, primarily related to the construction of the Snyder CDU and the hybrid energy storage system being constructed in Calistoga, California. Additionally, the Company purchased 6.0 million of equity securities in KORE. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities totaled 0.6 million, compared to cash used in financing activities of 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was attributable to 2.7 million in proceeds from insurance premium financings, partially offset by 1.6 million in insurance premium financing repayments, 0.4 million in tax payments related to the net settlement of equity awards, and 0.2 million in payments for finance lease obligations. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to 5.7 million in tax payments related to the net settlement of equity awards and 0.4 million in insurance premium financing repayments. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was 1.3 million in proceeds from insurance premium financings and 0.2 million in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To complement our condensed consolidated statements of operations, we use non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted S M expenses, adjusted R D expenses, adjusted G A expenses, adjusted operating expenses, and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures complement our GAAP amounts and such measures are useful to securities analysts and investors to evaluate our ongoing results of operations when considered alongside our GAAP measures. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures and their reconciliation to GAAP financial measures are shown below. 
 Effective September 30, 2024, the Company has included provision (benefit) for credit losses as a non-GAAP adjustment because management does not consider this item in assessing our ongoing performance. Prior periods have been adjusted to include provision (benefit) for credit losses as a non-GAAP adjustment.

 The following table provides a reconciliation from net loss to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, with net loss being the most directly comparable GAAP measure (amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net loss attributable to Energy Vault Holdings, Inc. (GAAP) (26,593) (18,942) (73,920) (76,271) Non-GAAP adjustments: Interest income, net (1,395) (1,902) (4,921) (6,131) Provision for income taxes (401) (397) Depreciation and amortization 251 235 825 670 Stock-based compensation expense 10,248 10,714 29,436 34,523 Reorganization expenses (23) 1,686 Gain on derecognition of contract liability (1,500) Asset impairment and loss on sale of assets (14) 551 Change in fair value of derivative asset conversion option 820 820 Provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,861 (5) 2,214 236 Foreign exchange losses 194 50 301 308 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) (14,651) (10,251) (44,508) (47,062) 
 We present adjusted EBITDA, which is net loss attributable to Energy Vault Holdings, Inc. excluding adjustments that are outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided above, as a supplemental measure of our performance and because we believe this measure is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. The adjusted EBITDA measure excludes the financial impact of items management does not consider in assessing our ongoing operating performance, and thereby facilitates review of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. 
 In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, one should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments noted above. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these types of adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss, operating loss, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. 
 Our adjusted EBITDA measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 it does not reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; 
 it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 it does not reflect stock-based compensation, which is an ongoing expense; 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and our adjusted EBITDA measure does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 
 it is not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows; 
 it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; 
 it does not reflect limitations on or costs related to transferring earnings from our subsidiaries to us; and 
 other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 Because of these limitations, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to use to meet our obligations. You

 should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 There have not been any changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those disclosed under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 13, 2024. 
 Emerging Growth Company Accounting Election 
 We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and have irrevocably elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period for new or revised financial accounting standards. We are expected to remain an emerging growth company through the end of 2026 and expect to continue to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period. This may make it difficult or impossible to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period exemptions for emerging growth companies because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
 
 Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 Recently issued and adopted/unadopted accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position because of adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 The majority of our contracts with customers are denominated in U.S. dollars, and certain of our definitive agreements could be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, the Swiss franc, the Australian dollar, the South African rand, the Brazilian real, and the Saudi riyal. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the cost of our solutions to our international customers, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 In addition, a portion of our revenue is earned and a portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies, such as the Euro, the Swiss franc, and the Australian dollar, and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we increase our exposure to foreign currencies and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Our operations could be adversely impacted by inflation, primarily from higher material, labor, and construction costs. While it is difficult to measure the impact of inflation for such estimates accurately, we believe, if our costs are affected due to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset higher costs through price increases or other corrective measures, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty may default on its contractual obligations resulting in a loss to us. Our customers include the counterparties for the sale of our energy storage products and solutions and the licensees of our intellectual property. The loss of one or more of our significant customers, their inability to perform under their contracts, or their default in payment could harm our business and negatively impact revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. Credit policies have been approved and implemented to assess our existing and potential customers with the objective of mitigating credit losses. These policies establish guidelines, controls, and credit limits to manage credit risk within approved tolerances by mandating an appropriate evaluation of the financial condition of existing and potential customers, monitoring agency credit ratings, and by implementing credit practices that limit exposure according to the risk profiles of 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 the counterparties. In addition, customers are required to make milestone payments based on their project s progress. We may also, at times, require letters of credit, parent guarantees, or cash collateral when deemed necessary. 
 Our overall exposure may be affected positively or negatively by macroeconomic or regulatory changes that may impact our counterparties. Currently, management does not anticipate a material adverse effect in our financial position or results of operations from the non-performance of a customer. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of all our customers. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials, including cement, steel, aluminum, and lithium, which are used in the components that we purchase from our suppliers and then as inputs to our products. Prices of these raw materials may be affected by supply restrictions or other logistic costs market factors from time to time. As we are not the direct buyer of these raw materials, we do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity risk. Significant price changes for these raw materials could reduce our operating margins if suppliers increase component prices and we are unable to recover such increases from our customers and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of such date are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II-Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Energy Vault has been and continues to be involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcome of which, if determined adversely to Energy Vault, would not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on Energy Vault s business, financial condition, and results of operations. From time to time, Energy Vault may become involved in additional legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Except as set forth below, as of the date of this report, there are no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 13, 2024. You should carefully consider the risks set forth in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of the Company s 2023 Annual Report, and all other information included in this Quarterly Report before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties. 
 Government control of currency conversion and expatriation of funds may affect our liquidity. 
 We have customers and subsidiaries located in jurisdictions that impose or may impose controls on the convertibility of the local currency into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of the jurisdiction. Therefore, we may experience delays, restrictions or limitations in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency to the Company, which could have a material effect on our liquidity and our business. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency in countries in which we transact, or the impossibility or difficulties in complying with the requirements and approvals of local authorities may delays, restrict or limit the ability of our customer to covert the amount owed to us to U.S. dollars and remit such amount to us, thus materially affecting our liquidity and business. 
 Our total backlog, bookings and developed pipeline may not be indicative of our future revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our backlog represents contracted but unrecognized revenue from projects and services yet to be completed, unrecognized revenue or other income from IP licensing agreements, and unrecognized revenue from tolling arrangements. Backlog excludes any potential future variable payments or IP royalties. As of September 30, 2024, backlog totaled 264.4 million. Our bookings represent the total aggregate contract value (excluding any potential future variable payments or intellectual property royalties) and total MWhs to be delivered from customer contracts signed during the period, net of the total aggregate value and total MWhs of contracts that were cancelled during the period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 bookings totaled million. Our developed pipeline represents uncontracted, potential revenue, from projects in which potential prospective customers have either awarded a project to the Company, or have put the Company on a shortlist to be awarded a project. As of September 30, 2024, developed pipeline totaled 2.7 billion. 
 There can be no assurance that our backlog, bookings and developed pipeline will result in actual revenue in the future in any particular period, or at all. This is because the actual receipt, timing, and amount of revenue under contracts included under backlog, bookings and developed contracts are subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. Our failure to realize revenue from contracts included in the total amounts estimated under backlog, bookings and developed pipeline could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, our contracts with customers are subject to delays and cancellations. Generally, a customer can cancel an order prior to installation, and, notwithstanding the fact that a customer s termination for convenience may obligate the customer to pay us certain fees, we may be unable to recover some of our costs in connection with design, permitting, installation, and site preparations incurred prior to cancellation. Cancellation rates in our industry could increase in any given period, due to factors outside of our control including an inability to install an energy storage system at the customer s chosen location because of permitting or other regulatory issues, unanticipated changes in the cost or availability of alternative sources of electricity available to the customer, or other reasons unique to each customer. Our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels, and certain of our expenses are fixed. If we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant resources or if we experience delays or cancellations, our business could be materially and adversely affected.

If the Commission shall enter any such stop order at any time, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the lifting of such order as soon as practicable. Additionally, the Company agrees that it shall comply with the provisions of Rule 424(b) and Rule 433, as applicable, under the Securities Act and will use its reasonable efforts to confirm that any filings made by the Company under such Rule 424(b) or Rule 433 were received in a timely manner by the Commission.

(f) Free Writing Prospectuses. During any period in which an Issuance Notice is pending and in which the Company is eligible to use a free writing prospectus, the Company shall furnish to the Agent for review, a reasonable amount of time prior to the proposed time of filing or use thereof, a copy of each proposed Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto to be prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by the Company insofar as such proposed amendment or supplement relates to the Shares or the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company shall not file, use or refer to any proposed Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto without the Agent s consent. The Company shall furnish to the Agent, without charge, as many copies of any Free Writing Prospectus prepared by or on behalf of, or used by the Company insofar as such proposed amendment or supplement related to the Shares or the transactions contemplated hereby, as the Agent may reasonably request.

(i) Blue Sky Compliance. The Company shall cooperate with the Agent and counsel for the Agent to qualify or register the Shares for sale under (or obtain exemptions from the application of) the state securities or blue sky laws or Canadian provincial securities laws (or other foreign laws) of those jurisdictions designated by the Agent, shall comply with such laws and shall continue such qualifications, registrations and exemptions in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Shares. The Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to take any action that would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not presently qualified or where it would be subject to taxation as a foreign corporation. The Company will advise the Agent promptly of the suspension of the qualification or registration of (or any such exemption relating to) the Shares for offering, sale or trading in any jurisdiction or any initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, and in the event of the issuance of any order suspending such qualification, registration or exemption, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal thereof as soon as practicable. 

23 (j) Earnings Statement. As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Agent an earnings statement (which need not be audited) covering a period of at least twelve months beginning with the first fiscal quarter of the Company occurring after the date of this Agreement which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 under the Securities Act; provided that the Company shall be deemed to have furnished such statements to its security holders and the Agent to the extent they are filed on the Commission s EDGAR system.

(n) Representations and Warranties. The Company acknowledges that each delivery of an Issuance Notice and each delivery of Shares on a Settlement Date shall be deemed to be (i) an affirmation to the Agent that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement are true and correct as of the date of such Issuance Notice or of such Settlement Date, as the case may be, as though made at and as of each such date, except as may be disclosed in the Prospectus (including any documents incorporated by reference therein and any supplements thereto); and (ii) an undertaking that the Company will advise the Agent if any of such representations and warranties will not be true and correct as of the Settlement Date for the Shares relating to such Issuance Notice, as though made at and as of each such date (except that such representations and warranties shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented relating to such Shares). (o) Deliverables at Triggering Event Dates; Certificates. The Company agrees that on or prior to the date of the first Issuance Notice and, during the term of this Agreement after the date of the first Issuance Notice, upon: (i) the filing of the Prospectus or the amendment or supplement of any Registration Statement or Prospectus (other than a prospectus supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Shares or a prospectus filed pursuant to Section 4(a)(ii)(B)), by means of a post-effective amendment, sticker or supplement, but not by means of incorporation of documents by reference into the Registration Statement or Prospectus; 

24 (ii) the filing with the Commission of an annual report on Form 10-K or a quarterly report on Form 10-Q (including any Form 10-K/A or Form 10-Q/A containing amended financial information or a material amendment to the previously filed annual report on Form 10-K or quarterly report on Form 10-Q), in each case, of the Company; or (iii) the filing with the Commission of a current report on Form 8-K of the Company containing amended financial information (other than information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 or 7.01 of Form 8-K or to provide disclosure pursuant to Item 8.01 of Form 8-K relating to reclassification of certain properties as discontinued operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144) that the Agent reasonably determines is material to the offering of securities of the Company; (any such event, a Triggering Event Date ), the Company shall furnish the Agent (but in the case of clause (iii) above only if the Agent reasonably determines that the information contained in such current report on Form 8-K of the Company is material) with a certificate as of the Triggering Event Date, in the form and substance satisfactory to the Agent and its counsel, substantially similar to the form previously provided to the Agent and its counsel, modified, as necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, (A) confirming that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct and (B) confirming that the Company has performed all of its obligations hereunder to be performed on or prior to the date of such certificate and as to the matters set forth in Section 5(a)(iii) hereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company subsequently decides to sell Shares following a Triggering Event Date when a suspension was in effect and did not provide the Agent with a certificate under this Section 4(o), then before the Company delivers the instructions for the sale of Shares or the Agent sells any Shares pursuant to such instructions, the Company shall provide the Agent with a certificate in conformity with this Section 4(o) dated as of the date that the instructions for the sale of Shares are issued.

In lieu of such opinions for subsequent periodic filings, in the discretion of the Agent, the Company may furnish a reliance letter from such counsel to the Agent, permitting the Agent to rely on a previously delivered opinion letter, modified as appropriate for any passage of time or Triggering Event Date (except that statements in such prior opinion shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented as of such Triggering Event Date).

The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 6(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have. (b) Indemnification of the Company, its Directors and Officers. The Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or the laws or regulations of foreign jurisdictions where Shares have been offered or sold or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, including any information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Free Writing Prospectus that the Company has used, referred to or filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and to reimburse the Company and each such director, officer and controlling person for any and all reasonable and documented expenses (including the reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Company) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by the Company or such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall only apply to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Agent Information expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any such Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 6(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Agent may otherwise have. (c) Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such 

30 indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6 or to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party s election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 6 for any reasonable and documented legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action), which counsel (together with any local counsel) for the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Agent (in the case of counsel for the indemnified parties referred to in Section 6(a) above) or the Company (in the case of counsel for the indemnified parties referred to in Section 6(b) above), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party and shall be paid as they are incurred. (d) Settlements. The indemnifying party under this Section 6 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. . No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such 

31 indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding. (e) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Agent, on the other hand, from the offering of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement; or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total gross proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total Selling Commissions received by the Agent. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Agent, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Agent, on the other hand, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6(c), any reasonable and documented legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 6(c) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 6(e); provided, however, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 6(c) for purposes of indemnification. The Company and the Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6(e) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(e). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(e), the Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the Selling Commissions received by the Agent in connection with the offering contemplated hereby. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 6(e), each officer and employee of the Agent and each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the 

32 Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. Section 7. TERMINATION SURVIVAL (a) Term. Subject to the provisions of this Section 7, the term of this Agreement shall continue from the date of this Agreement until the end of the Agency Period, unless earlier terminated by the parties to this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7. (b) Termination; Survival Following Termination. (i) Either party may terminate this Agreement prior to the end of the Agency Period, by giving written notice as required by this Agreement, upon ten (10) Trading Days notice to the other party; provided that, (A) if the Company terminates this Agreement after the Agent confirms to the Company any sale of Shares, the Company shall remain obligated to comply with Section 3(b)(v) with respect to such Shares and (B) Section 2, Section 6, Section 7 and Section 8 shall survive termination of this Agreement. If termination shall occur prior to the Settlement Date for any sale of Shares, such sale shall nevertheless settle in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (ii) In addition to the survival provision of Section 7(b)(i), the respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, of its officers and of the Agent set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent or the Company or any of its or their partners, officers or directors or any controlling person, as the case may be, and, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, will survive delivery of and payment for the Shares sold hereunder and any termination of this Agreement. Section 8. MISCELLANEOUS (a) Press Releases and Disclosure. The Company may issue a press release describing the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, and may file with the Commission a Current Report on Form 8-K, with this Agreement attached as an exhibit thereto, describing the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company shall consult with the Agent prior to making such disclosures, and the parties hereto shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, acting in good faith, to agree upon a text for such disclosures that is reasonably satisfactory to all parties hereto.
