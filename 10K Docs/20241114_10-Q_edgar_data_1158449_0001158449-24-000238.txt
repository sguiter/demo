 stores primarily within the United States, with additional locations in Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition, as of October 5, 2024, the Company served independently owned Carquest branded stores across the same geographic locations served by the Company s stores in addition to Mexico and various Caribbean islands. The Company s stores operate primarily under the trade names Advance Auto Parts and Carquest . 
 
 The Company has reportable segment and operating segments. The operating segments are aggregated primarily due to the economic and operational similarities of each operating segment as the stores and branches have similar characteristics, including the nature of the products and services offered, customer base and the methods used to distribute products and provide services to its customers. Worldpac was one of the Company s operating segments. As noted in Note 15 . Subsequent Events , the sale of Worldpac was completed November 1, 2024, resulting in the Company having operating segments, Advance Auto Parts/Carquest U.S. and Carquest Canada. 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 
 The accounting policies followed in the presentation of interim financial results are consistent with those followed on an annual basis. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), have been condensed or omitted based upon the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC interim reporting principles. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2023 as filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024, and the amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on May 30, 2024 (collectively the 2023 Form 10-K ). 
 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim

 million, million and million incurred in prior years but not previously recognized. These charges primarily related to product costs and vendor credits. Management assessed the materiality of the errors, including the presentation on prior period consolidated financial statements, on a qualitative and quantitative basis in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Materiality, codified in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. The Company concluded that these errors and the related impacts did not result in a material misstatement of its previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 and its previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the sixteen weeks ended April 22, 2023; the twelve and twenty-eight weeks ended July 15, 2023; and the twelve and forty weeks ended October 7, 2023. Correcting the cumulative effect of these errors in the fifty-two weeks ended December 30, 2023 would have had a significant effect on the results of operations for such period. 
 
 The Company has corrected the relevant prior periods of its consolidated financial statements and related footnotes for these and other immaterial corrections for comparative purposes, as previously disclosed in Note 18. Immaterial Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. The Company will also adjust previously reported financial information for such immaterial errors in future filings, as applicable. A summary of the corrections to the impacted financial statement line items from our previously issued financial statements are presented in Note 13. Immaterial Misstatement of Prior Period Financial Statements .

 reportable segment, and is intended to improve the disclosures about a public entity s reportable segments. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-07 and believes that the adoption will result in additional disclosures, but will not have any other impact on its consolidated financial statements and segment reporting. 
 
 Income Tax Disclosure Improvements 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes ASU 2023-09 , which requires a company to enhance its income tax disclosures. In each annual reporting period, the company should disclose the specific categories used in the rate reconciliation and additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, including disaggregation of taxes paid by jurisdiction. The related disclosures are effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and believes that the adoption will result in additional disclosures, but will not have any other impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Climate Disclosure Requirements 
 
 In March 2024, the SEC issued its final climate disclosure rules, which require the disclosure of climate-related information in annual reports and registration statements. The rules require disclosure in the audited financial statements of certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions and greenhouse gas emissions above certain financial thresholds, as well as amounts related to carbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates, if material. Additionally, the rule established disclosure requirements regarding material climate-related risks, descriptions of board oversight and risk management activities, the material impacts of these risks on a registrants' strategy, business model and outlook and any material climate-related targets or goals. On April 4, 2024, the SEC determined to voluntarily stay the final rules pending certain legal challenges. Prior to the stay in the new rules, disclosures would have been effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, except for the greenhouse gas emissions disclosure which would have been effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2026. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new rules on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

 billion, with customary purchase price adjustments for working capital and other items. The Company s sale of Worldpac was progress towards the changing landscape of the business with increased focus on the Advance blended-box model. The transaction closed on November 1, 2024. As a result, the Company has classified the results of operations and cash flows of Worldpac as discontinued operations in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for all periods presented. The related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations are classified as held for sale in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, beginning August 22, 2024, in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, the Company ceased recording depreciation and amortization for Worldpac s finite-lived intangible assets and operating lease right-of-use assets. 
 
 In connection with the Worldpac divestiture, the Company agreed to provide letters of credit in the aggregate amount of up to million, issued under its unsecured revolving credit facility, for up to months after closing of the transaction as credit support for Worldpac s new supply chain financing program, which letter of credit exposure will reduce to zero no later than 24 months after closing. Worldpac will remain a parts supplier for the Company following the close of the sale. Worldpac has entered into an agreement to supply, sell and deliver to the Company. Under this agreement, the Company intends to purchase at least 145 million of Worldpac s products during the period beginning on January 1, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2024. If the purchase minimum is met, the agreement automatically renews for one-year terms up to three years. Historically, the Company has made sales to Worldpac but there is no obligation to continue to do so as part of the purchase agreement. 
 
 Additionally, the Company and Worldpac entered into a Transition Services Agreement and Reverse Transition Services Agreement, pursuant to which the two entities will provide certain services to each other during the post-closing period. The minimum terms of the agreements are for twelve months, which may be extended by the Company and Worldpac for up to two three-month extension periods.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023 (filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024, and the amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on May 30, 2024 (collectively the 2023 Form 10-K )), and the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year.

Management Overview 
 
 A high-level summary of the Company s financial results for continuing operations for the third quarter of 2024 includes: 
 
 Net sales during the third quarter of 2024 were 2.15 billion, a decrease of 3.2 compared with the third quarter of 2023. Comparable store sales declined 2.3 . 
 Gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 42.3 of net sales, an increase of 541 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2023.

This was offset by strategic pricing investments . 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were 42.2 of net sales, an increase of 185 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2023. T his increase was primarily due to wage investments in frontline team members, implementation of the Company s strategic plan and the expenses related to the remediation of the previously disclosed material weaknesses. This was partially offset by a reduction in marketing expenses. 
 The Company generated diluted loss per share of 0.42 during the third quarter of 2024, compared with diluted loss per share of 1.24 for the comparable period of 2023. 

Business and Risks Update

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes certain financial measures not derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Net income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted SG A Margin, and Adjusted Operating Income, should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. 
 
 The company has presented these non-GAAP financial measures as the company believes that the presentation of the financial results that exclude (1) transformation expenses under the company s turnaround plan, (2) other significant costs and (3) nonrecurring tax expense are useful and indicative of the company's base operations because the expenses vary from period to period in terms of size, nature and significance. These measures assist in comparing the company s current operating results with past periods and with the operational performance of other companies in the industry. The disclosure of these measures allows investors to evaluate the company s performance using the same measures management uses in developing internal budgets and forecasts and in evaluating management s compensation. Included below is a description of the expenses the company has determined are not normal, recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate the company s business and the rationale for why providing these measures is useful to investors as a supplement to the GAAP measures. 
 
 Transformation Expenses Costs incurred in connection with the company's turnaround plan and specific transformative activities related to asset optimization that the company does not view to be normal cash operating expenses. These expenses primarily include: 
 
 Distribution network optimization Costs primarily relating to the conversion of the stores and DCs to market hubs, including temporary labor, team member severance, long-lived asset write off charges and incremental depreciation, as a result of accelerating depreciation of long-lived assets over a shorter useful life as a result of the optimization plans.

 Third-party professional services Costs relating to non-recurring services rendered by third-party vendors assisting with the turnaround initiatives. 
 
 Other Expenses Costs incurred by the company that are not viewed as normal cash operating expenses and vary from period to period in terms of size, nature, and significance, including but not limited to executive turnover and incremental costs associated with remediating the company's previously-disclosed material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Nonrecurring Tax Expense Income tax incurred by the company from the book to tax basis difference in the Worldpac Canada stock directly resulting from the sale of Worldpac.

 Typically, the Company has funded its cash requirements primarily through cash generated from operations, supplemented by borrowings under the Company s credit facilities and note offerings as needed. On August 22, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement to sell its Worldpac business for 1.5 billion, with customary adjustments for working capital and other items, as well as provision of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to 200 million for up to 12 months following the closing of the transaction, which letter of credit exposure will reduce to zero no later than 24 months after the closing, to support supply chain financing for the buyer. The transaction closed on November 1, 2024. Net proceeds from the transaction after paying expenses and taxes was approximately 1.2 billion. The Company intends to use net proceeds from the transaction for general corporate purposes, which may include the provision of additional working capital, funding internal operational improvement initiatives and repayment or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness. The Company believes funds generated from its expected results of operations, available cash and cash equivalents, net proceeds from the Worldpac sale and available borrowings under credit facilities and note offerings as needed will be sufficient to fund its obligations for the next year and beyond. 
 
 The Company s supplier finance programs did not have a material impact on its liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented nor does the Company expect such arrangements to have a material impact on its liquidity for the foreseeable future. However, as further described below, a future decline in our credit ratings would be expected to result in a significant impact to bank participation in the Company s supplier finance programs. While the Company does not expect such an impact to have a material impact on our overall liquidity, the Company does expect that it would have a material impact on its capital resources and capital allocation. See Note 12. Supplier Finance Programs of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
 
 On November 13, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 5 to the 2021 Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 5 (i) permits up to 575 million of certain restructuring charges to be added back to Consolidated EBITDAR (as defined therein), (ii) permits up to 800 million of unrestricted cash to be netted out of debt in the calculation of the Leverage Ratio (as defined therein), and (iii) reduces the minimum Consolidated Coverage Ratio (as defined therein) to 1.50 to 1.00 through July 12, 2025 and 1.75 to 1.00 thereafter. Amendment No. 5 also reduced the unsecured revolving credit facility under the 2021 Credit Agreement from 1.2 billion to 1.0 billion, amended the pricing on the loans thereunder in connection with changes in the Company s credit ratings and imposed certain other restrictions as described more fulsomely in Note 15. Subsequent Events . 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 The Company s share repurchase program permits the repurchase of the Company s common stock on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions from time to time. The Company s most recent amendment to the 2021 Credit Agreement generally prohibits open market share repurchases. 
 
 During the third quarter and forty weeks ended October 5, 2024 and October 7, 2023 , the Compan y did not purchase any shares of its common stock under the share repurchase program. The Company had 947.3 million remaining under the share repurchase program as of October 5, 2024.

 Analysis of Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes the Company s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: 
 Forty Weeks Ended (in thousands) October 5, 2024 October 7, 2023 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities 81,019 (28,314) Cash flows used in investing activities (116,482) (172,185) Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities (57,732) 204,047 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 11,766 (1,932) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (81,429) 1,616 
 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents is presented on a continuing basis which varies from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows which is presented on a consolidated basis . 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 For the forty weeks ended October 5, 2024 , cash flows provided by operating activities increased by 109.3 million to 81.0 million compared with the same period of prior year. The net increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in net working capital compared with prior year. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 For the forty weeks ended October 5, 2024 , cash flows used in investing activities decreased by 55.7 million to 116.5 million compared with the same period of prio r year. The decrease in cash used in investing activi ties was attributable t o lower capital spend due to fewer store openings and fewer IT projects partially offset by an increase in spend on distribution network optimizations. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 For the forty weeks ended October 5, 2024, cash flows used in f inancing activities was 57.7 million, an increase of 261.8 million co mpared with the same period of prior year. T he increase in cash used in financing activities was due to the issuances of senior unsecured notes in the prior year. This was partially offset by a decrease in dividends paid in the current year compared with the prior year. 
 
 The Company s Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend every quarter since 2006. Any payments of dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors and will depend upon the Company s results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. In addition, Amendment No. 5 to the 2021 Credit Agreement prevents the Company from increasing the amount of our cash dividends. 

Long-Term Debt 
 
 With respect to all senior unsecured notes for which Advance Auto Parts, Inc. Issuer is an issuer or provides full and unconditional guarantee, Advance Stores, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer, serves as the guarantor Guarantor Subsidiary ). The subsidiary guarantees related to the Issuer s senior unsecured notes are full and unconditional and joint and several, and there are no restrictions on the ability of the Issuer to obtain funds from its Guarantor Subsidiary. The Company s captive insurance subsidiary, an insignificant wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer, does not serve as guarantor of its senior unsecured notes. 
 
 For additional information, refer to Note 7. Long-term Debt and Fair Value of Financial Instruments of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

Table of Contents 

As of October 5, 2024, the Company had a credit rating from S P of BB+ and from Moody s Investor Service of Baa3. As of October 5, 2024, the outlooks by Standard Poor s and Moody s on the Company s credit rating were stable and negative, respectively. The current pricing grid used to determine the Company s borrowing rate under the Credit Agreement is based on the Company s credit ratings. The Company anticipates that it may receive a future downgrade in its credit ratings dependent on the strength of its balance sheet and the success and timing of its efforts to improve business operations. If the Company s credit ratings decline, the interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and the Company s access to additional financing on favorable terms may be limited. The most recent amendment to the Company s 2021 Credit Agreement provides for securitization of amounts outstanding under the facility in the event that the Company s ratings decline to a certain level. In addition, declines could reduce the attractiveness of certain supplier finance programs whereby third-party institutions finance arrangements to the Company s vendors based on the Company s credit rating, which could result in increased working capital requirements. The Company expects that a future decline in its credit ratings would have a significant impact on bank participation in its supplier finance programs, resulting in increased working capital requirements. The Company believes that its sources of cash, together with its ability to generate cash through existing or new credit facilities and notes offerings as needed, will be sufficient to fund any increases in working capital requirements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 There have been no significant changes in the Company s exposure to market risk since December 30, 2023. Refer to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the override of controls. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial reporting and financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of our internal controls may vary over time. 
 
 Management evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 5, 2024 . Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level solely due to the material weakness related to account reconciliations described below. 
 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

 Details on Accounting Resources Material Weakness 
 
 In our Form 10-Q for the period ended April 22, 2023, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that existed due to turnover of key accounting positions during the first quarter of 2023. The Company was unable to attract, develop and retain sufficient resources to fulfill internal control responsibilities during the first quarter 2023. 
 
 The Company has devoted significant time and resources to complete its remediation of the material weakness described above and has made significant progress towards the remediation during the third quarter of 2024. The following components of the remediation plan, among others, have been executed: 
 
 Backfilled open roles and hired approximately 40 experienced personnel, an increase of 37 from the first quarter of 2024, (both permanent employees and contract labor) with the requisite accounting and internal controls knowledge and experience to sufficiently complement the existing global controllership organization; 
 Completed the review of the organizational structure of the global controllership function by a third-party consultant and implemented recommended changes; 
 Assessed our methodologies, policies, and procedures to ensure adequate design and effectiveness of processes supporting internal control over financial reporting; 
 Assessed the specific training needs for newly hired and existing personnel and developed and delivered training programs designed to uphold our internal controls standards. Monthly trainings have been held with account reconciliation preparers and reviewers along with target trainings for individual control owners; and 
 Following the departure of the Company s Chief Financial Officer during the third fiscal quarter of 2023, hired a new Chief Financial Officer who began employment with the Company on November 27, 2023. 
 
 The Company considers that the actions described above are comprehensive and have sufficiently strengthened the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The significant progress observed to date provides evidence that the remediation efforts are effective in improving the control environment. Based on management s evaluation of the Company s accounting resources and personnel used to fulfill internal control responsibilities over a sustained period of financial reporting, the Company has concluded that the material weakness over accounting resources has been fully remediated as of October 5, 2024. 
 
 Details on Account Reconciliation Material Weakness 
 
 In addition, as disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the period ended April 20, 2024, in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the first quarter of 2024, management identified certain cash account reconciliations whereby a former employee in the Company s India-based shared services center circumvented a cash reconciliation controls policy and concealed unreconciled items. This individual did not follow the Company s policy to display all reconciling items in the reconciliation process. The company has taken appropriate remediation measures as previously disclosed including adding redundant or compensating controls, and has implemented a quality control function. Consistent with prior quarter, the Company is targeting completion of the account reconciliation material weaknesses in the second half of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Management believes that the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related financial information included in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our balance sheets, statements of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as of and for the periods presented. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Except for the changes described above, there has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter ended October 5, 2024, that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect its internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 On October 9, 2023, and October 27, 2023, two putative class actions on behalf of purchasers of the Company s securities who purchased or otherwise acquired their securities between November 16, 2022 and May 30, 2023, inclusive (the Class Period ), were commenced against the Company and certain of the Company s former officers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants made certain false and materially misleading statements during the alleged Class Period in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. These cases were consolidated on February 9, 2024, and the court-appointed lead plaintiff filed a consolidated and amended complaint on April 22, 2024. The consolidated and amended complaint proposes a Class Period of November 16, 2022 to November 15, 2023 and alleges that defendants made false and misleading statements in connection with (a) the Company s 2023 guidance and (b) certain accounting issues previously disclosed by the Company. On June 21, 2024, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated and amended complaint. The Company strongly disputes the allegations and intends to defend the case vigorously. 
 
 On January 17, 2024, February 20, 2024, and February 26, 2024, derivative shareholder complaints were commenced against the Company s directors and certain former officers alleging derivative liability for the allegations made in the securities class action complaints noted above. On April 9, 2024, the court consolidated these actions and appointed co-lead counsel. On June 10, 2024, the court issued a stay order on the consolidated derivative complaint pending resolution of the motion to dismiss for the underlying securities class action complaint. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Restructuring our operations is a significant undertaking and introduces risk to the continuity and results of our operations. 
 
 In November 2024, we announced a plan to restructure our operations to improve profitability and growth potential and streamline our operations. This plan is supplemental to other ongoing initiatives to simplify our business and improve profitable growth and entails, among other items, certain store and independent location closures as well as headcount reductions and organizational design changes to align our workforce to the expected needs of our business. We are also pursuing efficiencies in procurement, pricing and professional and outside services, in addition to operational efficiencies. These measures are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including whether we have targeted the appropriate areas for our cost-saving efforts and at the appropriate scale, our ability to successfully execute the restructuring plan and achieve the cost-savings anticipated while minimally disrupting our operations and whether, if required in the future, we will be able to appropriately target any additional areas for our cost-saving efforts. 
 
 We expect to incur restructuring charges and undertake other exit-related activities as a result of such initiatives. For example, execution of our plan is expected to result in the termination of certain leases, leading to exits of certain properties over time and the incurrence of expenses, including but not limited to impairment charges and contingent obligations, which could be material. The terms, scope and timing of any additional changes to our lease obligations, as well as any other effects on our landlord relationships or reputation with other real estate owners, are uncertain. As a result of the restructuring plan, we expect to incur approximately 300 - 500 million of cash charges, primarily as a result of closure sites and the reduction in force. Our expectations for charges to be incurred and cash to be expended in connection with the restructuring activities are based on a number of assumptions, and we may experience unanticipated consequences, such as higher than anticipated lease termination and facility closure costs, asset impairment or other unforeseen expenses related to the restructuring. 
 
 Implementing any restructuring plan, including the one we have outlined, presents potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve or sustain anticipated cost reductions or operational improvements. These risks include the 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 potential for management distraction from ongoing business activities, requirement of capital investment that could otherwise be used for the operation and growth of our existing business, inadequate support of important business functions due to staffing changes and other cost reduction efforts, delays or inability to achieve targeted efficiencies as a result of economic, competitive or other factors, failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing our restructuring plans, disruptions to important business relationships, and damage to our reputation and brand. Additionally, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity and accumulated knowledge or increased employee attrition and difficulty attracting and retaining highly skilled employees, which may, among other things, slow the progress of our turnaround initiatives or impair our ability to maintain and enhance our internal controls and procedures. 
 
 The implementation of our restructuring efforts, including the potential reduction of our facilities and workforce, may not improve our operational and cost structure or result in greater efficiency of our organization; and we may not be able to support sustainable profitable growth following our restructuring actions. Failure to achieve or sustain the expected cost reductions and other benefits related to these restructuring initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors found in the 2023 Form 10-K filed for the year ended December 30, 2023 for risks that, if they were to occur, could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects, which could in turn materially affect the price of the Company s common stock.

 Section 3.12 Non-Elective LTIP Shares Grant Deferrals. 
 
 (a) Each Shares Grant awarded to a Director under the 2004 LTIP, the 2014 LTIP or the 2023 LTIP will be automatically deferred under the Plan on a non-elective basis, and will be credited to the Director s Deferral Account.

If a Participant who is receiving installment payments dies before all payments have been made, all remaining amounts will be paid to the Participant's Beneficiary or Beneficiaries in a lump sum payment. Such payment will be made within the period prescribed in Section 5.5(c)(ii) below. 
 
 (iv) The designated payment date with respect to a withdrawal due to an Unforeseeable Emergency pursuant to Section 5.9 below will be by the fifth day of the month following the month in which occurs the date as of which the withdrawal request is approved by the Administrative Committee. 
 
 (b) For purposes of the administrative provisions of this Plan, a payment will be treated as having been made upon the date specified under subsection (a) above if the payment is made 
 
 (i) On such date or a later date within the same calendar year or 
 
 (ii) If later, by the 15th day of the third calendar month following the date so specified. 
 
 For clarity, the timing of distributions is intended to depend on the timing of the notification of separatione, as well as the type of distribution elected 
 
 o If notification to separate occurs prior to the 15th of the month, distribution will occur by the fifth business day of the month following the month in which occurs the event giving rise to the payment 
 
 o If notification to separate occurs after the 15th of the month, distribution will occur by the fifth business day of the month that commences following a 30-day administrative window after the event giving rise to the payment 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rules below will apply. 
 
 (i) If the calculation of the amount of the payment is not administratively practicable due to events beyond the control of the Participant (or the Participant s estate), the payment will be treated as made upon the specified date if the payment is made during the first calendar year in which the payment is administratively practicable. 
 14 

(ii) A payment to be made to a Beneficiary upon the date of the death of a Participant, or upon the death of a Beneficiary who has become entitled to payment due to the Participant s death, will be made during the period ending on December 31 of the first calendar year following the calendar year during which the death occurs. The Beneficiary may designate the year of payment. 
 
 (iii) For purposes of administrative convenience, payment may be made to a Participant no earlier than 30 days before the designated payment date prescribed in subsection (a) above. 
 
 (d) In no event will a Participant be permitted, directly or indirectly, to designate the taxable year of the distribution. 
 
 (e) The amount to be distributed to a Participant or a Beneficiary will be determined on the basis of the value of the applicable Deferral Account as of the first business day of the month immediately preceding the designated payment date with respect to the distribution at issue. 
 
 Section 5.6 Restriction on Distributions to Specified Employees. 
 
 (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.5 above, if a Participant becomes entitled to a distribution from the Plan by reason of Retirement or other Separation from Service, and if the Participant is a Specified Employee as of the date of such Retirement or other Separation from Service, then the amounts held in the Participant s Deferral Accounts will become payable as of the first day of the seventh month following the date of the Participant s Retirement or other Separation from Service (or, if earlier, as of the date of the Participant s death). 
 
 (b) If the distributions to the Specified Employee are to be made in annual installments, the delay in payment prescribed in subsection (a)(ii) above will apply solely to the first installment payment. Each subsequent installment payment will be made as of the date such payment otherwise would have been made pursuant to Section 5.5. 
 
 (c) The distribution restrictions prescribed in subsection (a)(ii) above will not apply to a payment to be made pursuant to Section 5.7(b)(i) or (ii) (regarding the payment of employment taxes and compensation deferred under the Plan or a certificate of divesture compliance distributions), or Section 10.2(b) (regarding domestic relations orders). 
 
 Section 5.7 No Acceleration of Scheduled Distributions. 
 
 (a) Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the time or schedule of any distribution of any portion of a Participant s Deferral Accounts will not be permitted to be accelerated, either at the election of the Participant or at the discretion of the Compensation Committee or the Administrative Committee. 
 
 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, distributions may be made to or on behalf of a Participant prior to the otherwise applicable designated payment date in the following situations 
 
 (i) As may be necessary to comply with a certificate of divestiture (as defined in Code Section 1043(b)(2)) 
 
 15 

(ii) To pay FICA taxes on amounts deferred under the Plan, or income taxes on additional charges arising from the Employer s payment of FICA taxes or for amounts attributable to the pyramiding of wages and taxes or 
 
 (iii) If the Plan at any time fails to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A and the underlying regulations. In that event, however, the accelerated payment may not exceed the amount required to be included in the Participant s income as a result of the Plan s failure to comply with the Code Section 409A requirements. 
 
 Section 5.8 Extension of Specified Time Deferral Period. Section 3.5(b) of the Plan permits a Participant to select a Deferral Period of a stated period of calendar years (i.e., a Specified Time Deferral Period ). In this connection, a Participant will be permitted to extend a Specified Time Deferral Period with respect to a Deferral Account, subject to the conditions set forth below. 
 
 (a) An election to extend the Specified Time Deferral Period with respect to any Deferral Account must be submitted under the Plan in accordance with the Administrative Committee s established procedures. 
 
 (b) Any such election will not take effect under the Plan until 12 months after the date on which the election is properly submitted. 
 
 (c) An election to extend a Specified Time Deferral Period must provide for the lengthening of the Specified Time Deferral Period for a period of not less than an additional five years. 
 
 (d) Any election to extend a Specified Time Deferral Period must be made at least 12 months prior to the designated payment date (as prescribed in Section 5.5(a)) for the first scheduled payment from the applicable Deferral Account. A deferral extension election may be modified or revoked prior to such deadline date. If not modified or revoked, the election will generally become irrevocable as of such deadline date. 
 
 (e) For purposes of this Section 5.8 
 
 (i) The entitlement to installment payments will be treated as the entitlement to a single payment and 
 
 (ii) The applicable designated payment date otherwise applicable to a Specified Time Deferral Period will be determined without regard to the restrictions on distributions to Specified Employees prescribed in Section 5.6. 
 
 Section 5.9 Delay of Payments Under Certain Circumstances. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, payment to a Participant will be delayed to a date after the designated payment date otherwise prescribed under Section 5.5 under any of the circumstances prescribed below. 
 
 (a) A payment to a Participant will be delayed where the Compensation Committee reasonably anticipates that the Company s or other Affiliated Company s income tax deduction with respect to such payment otherwise would be limited or eliminated by application of Code Section 162(m) provided, however, that in such event, the payment will be made either at the earliest date at which the Compensation Committee reasonably anticipates that the deduction of the payment of the 
 16 

amount will not be limited or eliminated by application of Code Section 162(m), or the calendar year in which the Participant Separates from Service. 
 
 (b) A payment to a Participant will be delayed where the Compensation Committee reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will violate federal securities laws or other applicable law provided, however, that in such event, the payment to be made at the earliest date at which the Company or other Affiliated Company reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will not cause such violation. For purposes of this subsection (c), the making of a payment that would cause inclusion in gross income or other application of any penalty provision or other provision of the Code is not treated as a violation of applicable law. 
 
 (c) A payment to a Participant will be delayed upon such other events and conditions as may be prescribed in generally applicable guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service. 
 
 Section 5.10 Payment Medium. 
 
 (a) All payments to a Participant (or to a Participant s Beneficiary) with respect to the Participant s DSU Accounts will be paid in Shares, unless the Compensation Committee in its discretion directs that such amounts be paid in cash. If Shares are not traded on The New York Stock Exchange on any day on which a payment of Shares is to be made under the Plan, then that payment will be made on the next day on which Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares paid from this Plan will be drawn from shareholder-approved stock incentive plans. 
 
 (b) The value of any fractional Shares otherwise payable with respect to a Participant will be paid in cash. Such value will be determined as of the last business day of the month immediately preceding the date of the payment or final payment, as the case may be. 
 
 Section 5.11 Unforeseeable Emergency Withdrawal. A Participant who incurs an Unforeseeable Emergency (as defined below) may submit a request to the Administrative Committee for a withdrawal equal to that portion (or all) of the Participant s Deferral Accounts as is then needed to alleviate the financial hardship resulting therefrom. Such withdrawals will be subject to the following provisions of this Section 5.11. 
 
 (a) For purposes of this Section 5.11 
 
 (i) An Unforeseeable Emergency means a severe financial hardship to a Participant resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant, or of the spouse, a dependent (as defined in Code Section 152(a)) or a primary beneficiary (as defined below) of the Participant the loss of the Participant s property due to casualty or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant and 
 
 (ii) A primary beneficiary of a Participant is an individual who is named as a Beneficiary of the Participant under the Plan, and who has an unconditional right to all, or a portion of, the balance of the Participant s Deferral Account upon the death of the Participant. 
 
 (b) The circumstances that will constitute an Unforeseeable Emergency will depend upon the facts of each case. Examples of circumstances that may qualify as an Unforeseeable Emergency (provided that the other conditions of this Section 5.11 are satisfied) are 
 
 17 

(i) The imminent foreclosure of, or eviction from, the Participant s primary residence 
 
 (ii) The need to pay for medical expenses, including non-refundable deductibles or the cost of prescription drugs and 
 
 (iii) The need to pay for the funeral expenses of the spouse, or dependent or primary beneficiary of the Participant. 
 
 (c) The purchase of a home and the payment of college tuition are not Unforeseeable Emergencies for purposes of this Plan. 
 
 (d) A withdrawal will not be permitted under this Section 5.11 to the extent that the hardship resulting from the Unforeseeable Emergency is, or may be, relieved 
 
 (i) Through the reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise 
 
 (ii) By the liquidation of the Participant s assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship or 
 
 (iii) By the cessation of deferrals under the Plan. 
 
 (e) The amount of any Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawal will be limited to that which the Administrative Committee determines is reasonably necessary to alleviate the hardship resulting from the occurrence of the Unforeseeable Emergency (which may include any amount necessary to pay any federal or state income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution). The determination of the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need must take into account any additional compensation that is available to the Participant upon cancellation of the Participant s deferral election due to the Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawal that is effected pursuant to Section 3.10(b). However, such determination is not required to take into account any additional Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawal that is available under another nonqualified deferred compensation plan, but which has not actually been paid from that other plan. 
 
 (f) After reviewing each Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawal request, the Administrative Committee will make a determination as to whether the circumstances satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency standards prescribed above, and will thereupon notify the requesting Participant of the determination. If the request is approved, the Administrative Committee will process payment of the withdrawal 
 
 (g) The Administrative Committee may establish a policy and procedures regarding the order in which Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawals are to be charged against the particular Deferral Accounts of a Participant. 
 
 Section 5.12 Withholding of Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, an Employer has the right to cause the withholding from payments made hereunder, or to require a Participant to remit to the Employer, any amount required for the Employer to satisfy all federal, state or local tax withholding obligations pertaining to the Participant. 
 
 18 

Section 5.13 USERRA Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article 5 to the contrary, the Plan will permit a Participant to elect a change in the time or the form of payment as may be required to comply with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act USERRA ). 

19 

Article 6 
 
 PLAN TERMINATION PAYMENTS UPON QUALIFIED CHANGE IN CONTROL EVENT 

Section 6.1 Termination of Plan Upon Change in Control. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, upon the occurrence of a Qualified Change in Control Event involving the Company or other Relevant Employer (as defined in Section 6.6(a) below), the Board as constituted immediately prior to the event may in its discretion terminate the Plan, or the portion of the Plan pertaining to the Relevant Employer, and cause to be distributed to each affected Participant the entire balance of all of the Participant s Deferral Accounts. The termination by such Board must occur within the 30 days preceding, or within the 12-month period following, the Qualified Change in Control Event. Such Plan termination distributions will be permitted only if 
 
 (a) All substantially similar non-qualified deferred compensation programs maintained by the Company and all other Affiliated Companies are terminated upon such Qualified Change in Control Event and 
 
 (b) All compensation deferred and held under each such deferred compensation program is distributed to Participants within 12 months of the date of termination of the applicable program. 
 
 Section 6.2 Qualified Change in Control Event. For purposes of this Article 6, a Qualified Change in Control Event with respect to any Participant means any of the following events 
 
 (a) A Qualified change in the ownership of a corporation that is a Relevant Employer (as prescribed in Section 6.3) 
 
 (b) A Qualified change in effective control of a corporation that is a Relevant Employer (as prescribed in Section 6.4) and 
 
 (c) A Qualified Change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation that is a Relevant Employer (as prescribed in Section 6.5). 
 
 Section 6.3 Change in the Ownership of a Corporation. 
 
 (a) For purposes of this Article 6, a change in the ownership of a corporation occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires ownership of stock of the corporation that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of such corporation. If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of a corporation, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in the ownership of the corporation (or to cause a change in the effective control of the corporation within the meaning of Section 6.4 below). 
 
 (b) For purposes of this Section 6.3, an increase in the percentage of stock owned by any one person, or by persons acting as a group, as a result of a transaction in which the corporation acquires its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of stock. 
 
 20 

(c) In all regards, for purposes of this Section 6.3, a change in the ownership of a corporation will be deemed to have occurred only when there is a transfer of stock of a corporation (or issuance of stock of a corporation), and stock in such corporation remains outstanding after the transaction. 
 
 Section 6.4 Change in the Effective Control of a Corporation. 
 
 (a) For purposes of this Article 6, a change in the effective control of a corporation occurs on the date that either 
 
 (i) A majority of members of the Company s Board is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Company s Board prior to the date of the appointment or election or 
 
 (ii) Any one person, or more than one person acting as a group acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the applicable corporation possessing 30 percent or more of the total voting power of the stock of such corporation. 
 
 (b) A change in effective control of a corporation may also occur in any transaction in which either of the two corporations involved in the transaction incurs a change in control event described under Section 6.3 or 6.5. 
 
 Section 6.5 Change in the Ownership of Substantial Portion of Assets. 
 
 (a) For purposes of this Article 6, a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of a corporation's assets occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a group acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the corporation that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 40 percent of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the corporation immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions. For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the corporation, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets. 
 
 (b) A transfer of assets by a corporation will not be treated as a change in the ownership of such assets, and such transfer will thus not constitute a Qualified Change in Control Event, if the assets are transferred to 
 
 (i) A shareholder of the corporation (immediately before the asset transfer) in exchange for or with respect to its stock 
 
 (ii) An entity, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation 
 
 (iii) A person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the corporation or 
 
 (iv) An entity, at least 50 percent of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in paragraph (iii). 
 21 

(c) For purposes of subsection (b) above, a person's status is determined immediately after the transfer of the assets. Thus, for example, a transfer to a corporation in which the transferor corporation has no ownership interest before the transaction, but which is a majority-owned subsidiary of the transferor corporation after the transaction is not treated as a change in the ownership of the assets of the transferor corporation. 
 
 Section 6.6 Definitions and Operating Rules. The following definitions and operating rules will apply for purposes of this Article 6. 
 
 (a) Relevant Employer. To constitute a Qualified Change in Control Event as to the particular Participant, the event must relate to one of the following corporate employers 
 
 (i) The Company 
 
 (ii) A subsidiary corporate Employer for whom the Participant is performing services at the time of the Qualified Change in Control Event or 
 
 (iii) A subsidiary corporate Employer that is a majority shareholder of an Employer identified in paragraph (ii) above, or any corporate Employer in a chain of corporations in which each corporation is a majority shareholder of another corporation in the chain, ending in a corporation identified in paragraph (ii) above. For purposes of this paragraph (iii), a majority shareholder of a corporate Employer is a shareholder owning more than 50 of the total fair market value and total voting power of such Employer. 
 
 (b) Persons Acting as a Group. Persons will not be considered to be acting as a group solely because they purchase or own stock of the same corporation at the same time, or as a result of the same public offering. However, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction with the corporation. If a person, including an entity, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in a corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation. 
 
 (c) Ownership Attribution. The ownership attribution rules of Code Section 318(a) will apply to determine stock ownership. Stock underlying a vested option is considered owned by the individual who holds the vested option (and the stock underlying an unvested option is not considered owned by the individual who holds the unvested option). For purposes of the preceding sentence, however, if a vested option is exercisable for stock that is not substantially vested (as defined in IRS Regulation 1.83-3(b) and (j)), the stock underlying the option is not treated as owned by the individual who holds the option. 
 
 Section 6.7 Special Rule for Certain Delayed Payments. Payment from a Participant s DSU Accounts that are calculated by reference to the value of Company stock will be treated as paid at a specified time or pursuant to a fixed schedule in conformity with the requirements of the Plan if such amounts are paid on the same schedule and under the same terms and conditions as payments to shareholders generally pursuant to a Qualified Change in Control Event described in Section 6.3 above (i.e., a change in the ownership of a corporation) or as payments to the Participant pursuant to a Qualified Change in Control Event described in Section 6.5 above (i.e., a change in the 
 22 

ownership of a substantial portion of a corporation s assets). Any amounts paid pursuant to such a schedule and such terms and conditions will not be treated as violating the initial or subsequent deferral election rules, to the extent that such amounts are paid not later than five years after the Qualified Change in Control Event. 

23 

Article 7 
 
 BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION 

Section 7.1 Beneficiary Designation. Each Participant will have the right, at any time, to designate any person, persons or entity as his Beneficiary or Beneficiaries. A Beneficiary designation will be made, and may be amended, by the Participant by filing a written designation with the Administrative Committee, on such form and in accordance with such procedures as the Administrative Committee will establish from time to time. 
 
 Section 7.2 No Beneficiary Designation. If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, then the Participant s Beneficiary will be the Participant s estate. 

24

The Administrative Committee may from time to time establish rules for the administration of this Plan, and it will have the exclusive right to interpret this Plan and to decide any matters arising in connection with the administration and operation of this Plan. All rules, interpretations and decisions of the Administrative Committee will be conclusive and binding on the Company, the Employers, Participants and Beneficiaries. 
 
 (e) The Administrative Committee is expressly reposed with the discretionary authority and powers in regard to all facets of any claims for benefits made under the Plan. In turn, the Compensation Committee is expressly reposed with the discretionary authority and powers in regard to all facets of the review of a denied claim for benefits. Such authority and powers include, but are not limited to, the following

 (g) The Company will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify each director, officer or Employee of the Company or any Affiliated Company (including the heirs, executors, administrators and other personal representatives of such person), each member of the Compensation Committee and Administrative Committee against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any threatened, pending or actual suit, action or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature or otherwise) in which such person may be involved by reason of the fact that he or she is or was serving this Plan in any capacity at the request of the Company or any other Affiliated Company, the Compensation Committee or the Administrative Committee. 
 
 (h) Any expense incurred by the Company, an Employer, the Compensation Committee or the Administrative Committee relative to the administration of this Plan will be paid by the Company or other Affiliated Company and or may be deducted from the DSU Accounts of the Participants as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
 
 26 

(i) Any member of the Compensation Committee or the Administrative Committee may also be a Participant, but no committee member will have power to take part in any discretionary decision or action affecting his own interest as a Participant under this Plan unless such decision or action is upon a matter which affects all other Participants similarly situated and confers no special right, benefit or privilege not simultaneously conferred upon all other such Participants. 
 
 Section 8.2 Claim Procedure. 
 
 (a) If a Participant or Beneficiary makes a written request alleging a right to receive payments under this Plan or alleging a right to receive an adjustment in benefits being paid under this Plan, such actions will be treated as a claim for benefits. All claims for benefits under this Plan will be sent to the Administrative Committee. 
 
 (b) If the Administrative Committee determines that any individual who has claimed a right to receive benefits, or different benefits, under this Plan is not entitled to receive all or any part of the benefits claimed, the Administrative Committee will inform the claimant in writing of such determination and the reasons thereof in terms calculated to be understood by the claimant. The notice will be sent within 90 days of the claim unless the Administrative Committee determines that additional time, not exceeding 90 days, is needed and so notifies the Participant. The notice will make specific reference to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based, and will describe any additional material or information that is necessary. Such notice will, in addition, inform the claimant of the procedure that the claimant should follow to take advantage of the review procedures set forth below in the event the claimant desires to contest the denial of the claim, and the right of the claimant to bring a civil action under ERISA if the claim is denied upon further review. Upon request, and free of charge, the claimant will be provided with reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim for benefits. 
 
 (c) The claimant may within 90 days thereafter submit in writing to the Administrative Committee a notice that the claimant contests the denial of his or her claim and desires a further review of the denied claim. The request for review will be directed to the Compensation Committee, which will review the claim and authorize the claimant to review pertinent documents and submit issues and comments relating to the claim. The Compensation Committee will render a final decision with specific reasons thereof in writing and will transmit it to the claimant within 60 days of the written request for review, unless the Compensation Committee determines that additional time, not exceeding 60 days, is needed, and so notifies the Participant. If the claim is to be denied in whole or in part upon review, the written notice to the claimant will include the following 
 
 (i) The specific reason or reasons for the denial

In such case, a claim review determination may be made by no later than the date of the second meeting following the Plan s receipt of the request for review. If special circumstances (such as the need to hold hearing) require a further extension of time for processing, a determination will be rendered not later than the third meeting of the committee following the Plan s receipt of the request for review. If such an extension of time for review is required because of special circumstances, the claimant will be provided with written notice of the extension, describing the special circumstances and the date as of which the claim review determination will be made, prior to the commencement of the extension. The claimant will be notified of the claim review determination as soon as possible, but not later than five days after the determination is made.

Article 9 
 
 AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF PLAN 
 
 Section 9.1 Amendment. The Board or the Compensation Committee may at any time amend this Plan in whole or in part, provided, however, that no amendment will be effective to decrease the balance in, or otherwise alter the election made with respect to, any Deferral Account as accrued at the time of such amendment, nor will any amendment otherwise have a retroactive effect. In addition, any amendment that has the effect of changing the time or form of payment under the Plan with respect to any Participant will be subject to the provisions of Sections 5.7 and 5.8 (regarding the prohibition against the acceleration of payments and the restrictions on changes in the time or form of payments).

 (a) In the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 5 that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 3 , (iii) except when the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 5(b) , no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 5(b) within sixty (60) calendar days after receipt by the Company of the Indemnitee s written request for indemnification, (iv) under circumstances in which the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 5(b) , no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 5(b) within eighty (80) calendar days after receipt by the Company of the Indemnitee s written request for indemnification (unless an objection to the selection of such Independent Counsel has been made and substantiated and not withdrawn, in which case the applicable time period shall be seventy (70) calendar days after the Delaware Chancery Court or another court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware (or such person as is appointed by such court to make such determination) has determined or appointed the person to act as Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 5(b) ), (v) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 2(d) or Section 2(e) within twenty (20) calendar days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor or (vi) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 2(b) or Section 2(c) is not made within twenty (20) calendar days after a determination has been made pursuant to Section 5(b) that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, then the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek an adjudication by the Delaware Chancery 
 6 

Court of the Indemnitee s entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, if the foregoing conditions have been satisfied, the Indemnitee, at the Indemnitee s option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days following the date on which the Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 7(a) provided , however , that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a proceeding brought by the Indemnitee to enforce the Indemnitee s rights to indemnification under Section 2(d) . 
 
 (b) In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 5(b) that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 7 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on the merits and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. 
 
 (c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 5(b) that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 7 , absent (i) a misstatement or misrepresentation by the Indemnitee (or anyone acting on the Indemnitee s behalf) of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make the Indemnitee s statement (or statements of persons acting on behalf of the Indemnitee) not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification or in connection with the provision of information or documentation pursuant to the last sentence of Section 5(b) or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law. 
 
 (d) In the event that the Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 7 , seeks a judicial adjudication or an award in arbitration to enforce the Indemnitee s rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, then the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company against, any and all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in such judicial adjudication or arbitration, but only if (and only to the extent) the Indemnitee prevails therein. If it shall be determined in said judicial adjudication or arbitration that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of Expenses sought, the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication or arbitration shall be appropriately prorated. 
 
 8. Non-Exclusivity . Except to the extent expressly provided herein, the rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Company s Certificate of Incorporation, the Company s Bylaws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders, or a resolution of directors, or otherwise, both as to action in or by reason of the Indemnitee s Corporate Status and as to action in or by reason of any other capacity of the Indemnitee while serving as a director or officer of the Company. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. In the event of any change after the date of this Agreement in any applicable law, statute or rule that expands the power of a Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its board of directors or an officer, employee, agent or fiduciary, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greatest benefits afforded by such change. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8 , to the extent the time periods specified in Section 3 and Section 7(a) with respect to the time at which the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek an adjudication or an award in arbitration as to the Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification or advancement differ from similar time periods specified in the Company s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, the time periods set forth in Section 3 and Section 7(a) shall control and be binding on the Indemnitee and the Company and shall be deemed a waiver of any contrary right specified in the Company s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws. 
 7 

The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy. 
 
 9. Insurance, Subrogation and Other Sources of Payment . 
 
 (a) To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company or Another Enterprise, the Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such director, officer, employee or agent under such policy or policies. If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a Proceeding pursuant to Section 15 , the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such Proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies. To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company or Another Enterprise, the provision of directors and officers liability insurance as provided in this Section 9(a) shall be in addition to the Company s obligations under Section 2 and Section 3 and shall not be deemed to be in satisfaction of those obligations. 
 
 (b) In the event of any payment to or on behalf of the Indemnitee under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights. 
 
 (c) Except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment to the Indemnitee with respect to amounts otherwise indemnifiable (or for which advancement is otherwise required) if and to the extent that the Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to affect any right of contribution of or against the Company in the event the Company and any other person or persons have co-equal obligations to indemnify or advance expenses to the Indemnitee. 
 
 (d) The Company s obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses under this Agreement to the Indemnitee, in connection with or by reason of the Indemnitee s service at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of Another Enterprise, shall be reduced by any amount that the Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement of Expenses from such Other Enterprise with respect to the Proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of Expenses is sought. 
 
 10. Contribution . To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if, in connection with any Proceeding (or part thereof) in respect of which the Indemnitee would otherwise be entitled to indemnification hereunder, the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to the Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, then the Company, in lieu of indemnifying the Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount that is incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding (or such part thereof) and that would otherwise have been subject to indemnification hereunder, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding to reflect (a) the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Indemnitee, on the other hand, as a result of the event(s) and or transaction(s) giving cause to such Proceeding (or such part thereof) and or (b) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors, officers, employees and agents), on the one hand, and the Indemnitee, on the other hand, in connection with such event(s) and or transaction(s). 
 8 

11. Settlements . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Company s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, the Company shall have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee for any amounts paid by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in settlement of any Proceeding, unless the Company has consented in writing to such settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall not settle any claim in any manner that would impose any fine or obligation on the Indemnitee without the Indemnitee s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
 
 12. Survival of Rights, Binding Effect and Successors and Assigns . 
 
 (a) The indemnification and advancement of Expenses and other rights provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Agreement shall continue during the period that the Indemnitee is a director or officer of the Company and shall continue through and after the Termination Date so long as the Indemnitee shall, by reason of the Indemnitee s Corporate Status, be subject to any possible Proceeding (including any appeal thereto) with respect to any action taken or omitted (or that is alleged to have been taken or omitted) by the Indemnitee, or any facts or events that occurred (or that are alleged to have occurred), on or before the Termination Date, and shall further continue for such period of time following the conclusion of any such Proceeding as may be reasonably necessary for the Indemnitee to enforce rights and remedies pursuant to this Agreement as provided in Section 7 . 
 
 (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon the Indemnitee and upon the Company and its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee and the Indemnitee s heirs, personal representatives, executors, administrators and assigns and to the benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns. 
 
 (c) The Company further agrees that in the event the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any corporation or entity, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company as a result of such transaction assume the obligations of the Company set forth in this Agreement, including any requirements with respect to directors and officers liability insurance set forth in Section 9 . 
 
 13. Severability . If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law (b) such provision or provisions shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto and (c) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby. 
 
 14. Acknowledgement . The Company expressly acknowledges, confirms and agrees that it has entered into this Agreement and has assumed the obligations imposed on the Company hereby to induce the Indemnitee to serve or continue to serve as a director or officer of the Company, and the 
 9

In addition, both the Company and the Indemnitee acknowledge that in certain instances, federal law or applicable public policy may prohibit the Company from indemnifying its directors, officers, employees, agents or fiduciaries under this Agreement or otherwise. The Indemnitee understands and acknowledges that the Company may be required in the future to undertake with the Securities and Exchange Commission to submit the question of indemnification to a court in certain circumstances for a determination of the Company s rights under public policy to indemnify the Indemnitee. 
 
 15. Notice by Indemnitee . The Indemnitee agrees to notify the Company promptly and in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, petition, indictment, information or other document relating to the actual or threatened commencement of any Proceeding or matter that may be subject to indemnification or advancement of Expenses covered by this Agreement.
