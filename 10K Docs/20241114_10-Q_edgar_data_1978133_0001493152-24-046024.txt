interests in. Yerba is a beverage manufacturer focusing on the development and distribution of plant-based energy drinks
and seltzers. 

On
May 19, 2022, Yerba (formerly Kona Bay Technologies Inc. Kona Bay )) entered into a definitive arrangement agreement
and plan of merger, as amended on August 31, 2022 and February 8, 2023, with Yerba USA, Kona Bay Technologies (Delaware) Inc. Merger Sub ), a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of the Company, 1362283 B.C. Ltd. FinCo ), a wholly-owned
British Columbia subsidiary of Kona Bay, Todd Gibson and Karrie Gibson, pursuant to which Kona Bay proposed to complete a business combination
with Yerba USA via the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding securities of Yerba USA from the securityholders
(collectively, the Original Yerba Securityholders of Yerba USA (the Transaction ). The Transaction
was subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange TSXV and constituted a reverse takeover of Kona Bay by Yerba 
USA as defined in TSXV Policy 5.2 Change of Business and Reverse Takeovers . 

On
February 8, 2023, Yerba completed the Transaction with Yerba USA by way of a reverse merger conducted pursuant to: (i)
the provisions of the Delaware General Corporations Law DGCL in which Merger Sub merged with and into Yerba USA,
and (ii) a plan of arrangement conducted pursuant to the provisions of the BCBCA, which resulted in the amalgamation of Kona Bay with
FinCo. In connection with the closing of the Transaction, Yerba (formerly, Kona Bay Technologies Inc.) consolidated its issued
and outstanding common shares (each, a Common Share on the basis of 5.8 pre-consolidation Common Shares for every
one post-consolidation Common Share and changed its name from Kona Bay Technologies Inc. to Yerba Brands
Corp. 

Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP and include Yerba and its subsidiaries and
include the accounts of all majority owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control and, when applicable, entities in
which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. The Company had the following wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024: 

Direct 
 
 Yerba 
 LLC (1) 

Indirect 

(1) 

These unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the company s latest consolidated annual financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2023
that was filed in our Form 10 filed with the SEC on July 19, 2024. In general, disclosure provided in these unaudited condensed interim
consolidated financial statements do not repeat the disclosure provided in the Company s most recent audited consolidated annual
financial statements. However, these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are,
in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim period presented. 

Going
Concern 

Yerba s
evaluation of its ability to continue as a going concern requires it to evaluate its future sources and uses of cash sufficient to
fund its currently expected operations in conducting business activities one year from the date its unaudited condensed interim
consolidated financial statements are issued. Yerba evaluates the probability associated with each source and use of cash
resources in making its going concern determination. 

Due to our recurring losses, the ongoing challenging market conditions
for beverage companies and our limited cash balance as of September 30, 2024, management believes that it is probable that the Company
will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due within one year after the date that the unaudited condensed interim consolidated
financial statements are issued. While the Company is attempting to plan additional financings, including equity and debt, which are intended
to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, those financings may
not occur. If the financings do not occur, management will try and implement alternative arrangements, and such arrangements could have
a potentially significant negative impact on the current net asset value of the Company. These alternatives include: (1) raising additional
capital by means other than those planned through equity and/or debt financing; and/or (2) entering into new commercial relationships
to help fund future expenses. 

As
a result of the Company s recurring losses from operations, and the need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital
requirements within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, there is uncertainty regarding the Company s
ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management
Estimates 

The
preparation of the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the use of
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. These estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances, including the potential future effects of macroeconomic trends and events, such as inflation and
interest rate levels; supply chain disruptions; uncertainty from potential recessionary effects; climate-related matters; market,
industry and regulatory factors, including permitting issues; global events, such as the ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine and
the middle east; and public health matters. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the Company s operating
results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. While management
believes that such estimates are reasonable when considered in conjunction with the Company s unaudited condensed interim
consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole, actual results could differ from these
estimates. 

The
Company s contracts with customers include variable consideration including customer rebates and quick pay discounts. The Company
estimates variable consideration, which it does not consider to be constrained, using either the most likely amount or expected value
methods depending on the type of variable consideration. 

The
Company only provides refunds for products that are damaged during delivery to the customer. However, instances of refunds are rare and
have not historically had a material impact on the Company s results of operations. Finally, Yerba has made an accounting
policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both
imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by the entity from a customer. 

In
addition to variable consideration, the Company also provides payments to certain customers for slotting fees. In accordance with the
guidance in ASC 606-10-32, the Company determined that the payment is not in exchange for a distinct good or service and it is therefore
recognized as a reduction to the transaction price. As the slotting fee payment covers the life of the contract with a customer, the
initial payment is recognized as an asset and is amortized as a reduction to revenue on a rational and reasonable basis over the estimated
life of the contract. 

Costs
to Obtain a Contract with a Customer 

The
Company does not recognize any assets related to either costs to obtain or fulfil a contract with a customer. We incur certain delivery
costs prior to transferring control of Yerba product to our customers (i.e. outbound freight). In accordance with the guidance
in ASC 606-10-25, those costs are recognized as a fulfilment cost as they are provided prior to transferring control of the Yerba 
product to our customer (i.e. akin to shipping and handling). Further, the costs are classified in general and administrative within
the unaudited condensed interim consolidated statement of operations. 

ownership interest in the combined company, and therefore, based on million shares outstanding
immediately prior to the merger, would have had to issue approximately million shares to the owners of the legal parent (to retain
an ownership). In addition, based on an equity financing by the Company which occurred immediately before the transaction, the Company
determined that the common shares had a fair value of per share. This resulted in the determination of the fair value of the consideration
transferred in the transaction was approximately million million shares x per Common Share) and that of the million
transferred approximately million should be allocated to the cash acquired from Kona Bay (i.e., the net assets acquired)
and the remaining million should be recognized as a charge to equity as follows: 

Net assets acquired (cash) 

Charge to additional paid in capital 

In
addition, the Company presented the acquisition of Kona Bay as a recapitalization line item in our statement of changes
in shareholders equity reflecting: (1) the number of Kona Bay s outstanding common shares immediately prior to the transaction;
and (2) the approximately million in fair value of consideration transferred (calculated pursuant to the paragraph above). Further,
while the guidance in ASC 805-40 also requires a revision to historical equity (of the combined company) to reflect the legal capital
of the legal acquirer, the Company concluded that this was not required in our scenario as the conversion ratio, which reflects the number
of common shares issued by the legal acquirer to effectuate the transaction compared to the number of common shares in the capital of
Yerba outstanding immediately prior to the transaction, was 1:1.

Convertible
Notes 

On
April 13, 2023, Yerba closed the first tranche (the First Tranche of its brokered debenture unit (each, a Debenture
Unit offering which consisted of Debenture Units for gross proceeds of . On May 5, 2023, Yerba closed
the second tranche (the Second Tranche pursuant to which it issued an additional Debenture Units for gross proceeds
of , and for aggregate gross proceeds, together with the closing of the First Tranche, of . 

Each
Debenture Unit consisted of: (i) one (1) convertible debenture (each, a Debenture in the principal amount of ; and
(ii) share purchase warrants. The Debentures mature on (the Maturity Date ), and bear interest at a rate
of per annum, payable on the earlier of the Maturity Date or the date of conversion of the Debentures. The interest will be payable
in Common Shares to be determined at the Market Price (as that term is defined in the Policies of the TSXV). 

In
accounting for the Debentures, the Company concluded the conversion option should not be bi-furcated from the debt host as it was considered
indexed to the company s stock in accordance with ASC 815-40. Further, the Company also concluded that the detachable warrants
should be classified in equity as they: (1) were not within the scope of ASC 480-10; and (2) should be considered indexed to the Company s
Common Shares. In accordance with ASC 470-20, the Company recognized both the Debentures and detachable warrants at their relative fair
values. This resulted in the recognition of a debt discount that is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the Debenture
Units. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded accretion expense of and , respectively.
The remaining unamortized debt discount balance as of September 30, 2024 was . Further, the remaining balance of the convertible
debentures as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was and , respectively.

Overview 

Yerba 
was founded by Todd Gibson and Karrie Gibson in 2016 to create plant-based energy drinks containing yerba mate, a South American herb
and a natural source of caffeine. Yerba s first beverage was launched in the first quarter of 2017. 

Yerba 
is engaged in the development, marketing, sale, and distribution of plant-based energy beverages that do not contain calories, carbohydrates,
or sugar. Yerba s line of beverages are blended with non-GMO plant-based ingredients and offer the benefits of yerba mate
and white tea; sustainably sourced from Brazil and other growing regions in South America. 

Yerba 
beverages are created to provide products targeted at consumers focused on health, wellness, and fitness and seeking healthier beverages
as an alternative to existing energy drinks. The products are formulated to provide a more refreshing taste than coffee, with additional
benefits to existing sodas and sparkling waters, along with healthier ingredients than traditional energy drinks. Yerba s
products complement a variety of healthy lifestyles, such as non-GMO, Keto, Vegan, Kosher, Paleo and gluten-free diets. 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes that the
Company will continue as a going concern and that contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and
commitments in the normal course of business. The Company had an accumulated deficit of 41.5 million and 34.5 million as of
September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Further, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 0.3
million and 1.0 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s primary focus in recent
months has been and will continue to be supporting the manufacturing of its products which requires capital and resources. The
Company expects that its operating losses and negative cash flows will continue for the foreseeable future. Based on the
Company s currently available cash resources, current and forecasted level of operations, and forecasted cash flows for the
12-month period subsequent to the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements, the
Company will require additional funding to continue to progress its operational obligations as they come due. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its
obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, and to generate profitable
operations in the future. Management plans to provide for the Company s capital requirements through financing, operations, or
other transactions, including third party loans.

20 

Commitments 

As
discussed in our consolidated financial statements for the annual period ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into an office
lease agreement during December of 2022. The ongoing monthly payments are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s
financial condition. 

In
addition to the lease agreement, the Company also enters into unconditional purchase obligations for inventory items such as cans and
product ingredients. However, these obligations are not entered into for a period greater than one year. The Company has not entered
into any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Going
Concern 

Yerba s evaluation of its ability to
continue as a going concern requires it to evaluate its future sources and uses of cash sufficient to fund its currently expected operations
in conducting business activities one year from the date the financial statements are issued. Yerba evaluates the probability
associated with each source and use of cash resources in making its going concern determination. 

Due to our recurring losses, the ongoing challenging
market conditions for beverage companies and our limited cash balance as of September 30, 2024, management believes that it is probable
that the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due within one year after the date that the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements are issued. While the Company is attempting to plan additional financings, which are intended to mitigate the conditions
or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, those financings may not occur. If the financings
do not occur, management will try and implement alternative arrangements, and such arrangements could have a potentially significant negative
impact on the current net asset value of the Company. These alternatives include: (1) raising additional capital by means other than those
planned through equity and/or debt financings; and/or (2) entering into new commercial relationships to help fund future expenses. 

As
a result of the Company s recurring losses from operations, and the need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital
requirements within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, there is uncertainty regarding the Company s
ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern.

Yerba s
revenues declined by 1.4 million, or 45 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior
year. This decline was primarily attributed to the non-renewal of its agreement with Sam s Club, the nation s
second-largest club retailer, as well as the challenging consumer packaged goods (CPG) U.S. market today, which has been impacted by
inflation and may be contributing to a reduction in consumer basket size. Despite this decrease, Yerba continued to advance
its distribution footprint, executing with major retailers such as Kroger, Amazon, and Costco, along with multiple other retail
chains. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company prioritized efforts to stabilize its business foundation, focusing on core
strengths. Key growth was seen in the Natural Foods, Direct-to-Consumer, and Direct Store Delivery DSD channels, bolstered by the
successful rollout of the new 12oz can platform launched in Q1 2024. Club store placements continued to perform well in select
regions; however, a reduction in the number of stocked club stores as noted above led to a decline in quarterly sales.

Yerba s
revenues declined by 5.4 million, or 54 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year.
Throughout this period, the Company prioritized optimizing its customer base by phasing out less profitable accounts, including previously
announced exits from Sam s Club and other high-slotting, low-volume retailers, which resulted in lower revenues for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period. Yerba has instead focused on growth-oriented retail partnerships
that enhance gross margins and deliver greater shareholder value. Significant progress was made in core focus channels, establishing
a strong foundation for future growth. The Company also expanded its Direct-to-Consumer segment, introducing new variety packs and increasing
brand awareness through a broader network of social media influencers and digital advertising. Additionally, Yerba strengthened
its distributor relationships, onboarding 14 new distributors in the third quarter of 2024 to support its growth initiates for 2025 and
beyond. Nine-month 2024 revenues were also impacted by the challenging CPG U.S. market, which has been impacted by higher inflation earlier
in the period and as the Company transitioned from 16oz to 12 oz packaging, aligning with consumer demand for a more efficient product
size, however this also resulted in decreased sales as the Company transitioned to the new can format. This transition was completed
in Q2 2024.

to a decrease in expense related to performance shares granted upon consummation of the reverse takeover during the nine months

million, a decrease of employee benefits of 0.5 million and a decrease of other expenses 0.2 million.

levels. By concentrating on select channels, the Company has demonstrated its ability to operate more efficiently. This has involved
reducing the number of promotions during the period and eliminating programs that did not meet expectations, such as paid pallet positions,
slotting fees, and other sales initiatives. Additionally, the Company has prioritized more efficient and effective digital targeting
in its eCommerce channels, which continues to deliver positive results.

We
maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information

specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required
to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

The
Company s management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of
the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

Based
upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
