We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, prospects, strategy, and financial needs. The outcomes of the events described in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 13, 2024 (our "Annual Report"), and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

 million since inception and recorded a net loss of million for the nine months then ended and expects to incur additional losses in the future. If the Company s revenue levels from its products are not sufficient or if the Company is unable to secure additional funding when desired, the Company may need to delay the development of its products, scale back its business and operations, or change its business strategy. The Company believes that its existing sources of liquidity will satisfy its working capital and capital requirements for at least 12 months from the issuance of its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Any failure to generate increased revenue, achieve improved gross margins, or control operating costs could require the Company to raise additional capital through equity or debt financing. Such additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and could require the Company to modify, delay, or abandon some of its planned future expansion or expenditures or reduce some of its ongoing operating costs, which could harm its business, operating results, financial condition, and ability to achieve its intended business objectives.

Common Stock Warrants In conjunction with the funding of the Initial Loan under the Hercules Loan Agreement, the Company issued common stock warrants to the Lenders to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share. Each warrant is exercisable for up to seven years from the date of issuance. The warrants are classified as equity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of the issued warrants recorded was million, which was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. These warrants were recorded at fair value upon their issuance in additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The issued warrants are not remeasured after the issuance date. If the additional Term Loans are funded, the Company will be obligated to issue to the Lenders additional warrants to purchase common stock in an amount equal to of the funded balance of each tranche, divided by the exercise price on the date the Company draws funds from such tranche, or the issuance date. The exercise price will be calculated using the five-day volume-weighted average stock price as of such date. The unissued warrants do not meet the requirements for classification in equity, and are recorded as liabilities in other noncurrent liabilities in the financial statements. The fair value of the unissued common stock warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing method and they were recorded at fair value upon the funding of the Hercules Loan Agreement. The unissued warrants are remeasured at each reporting date after the issuance date. According to the fair value measurement criteria, the unissued warrants are considered Level 3 liabilities, with an overall value of less than million as of September 30, 2024.

Ite m 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included in Park I, Item 1, Financial Statements, within this Quarterly Report and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in our Annual Report. Certain statements included in this discussion and analysis constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to considerable risks and uncertainties. Please see the information under the heading Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report. 
 Overview 
 Sight Sciences mission is to develop transformative, interventional technologies that allow eyecare providers to procedurally elevate the standards of care empowering people to keep seeing. We are passionate about improving patients lives by helping them preserve their sight. Our objective is to develop and market products for use in new treatment paradigms and to create an interventional mindset in eyecare whereby our products may be used in procedures which supplant conventional outdated approaches. Our business philosophy is grounded in the following principles: 
 comprehensively understanding disease physiology; 

developing products that are intended to preserve, protect and restore natural physiological functionality to diseased eyes; 

developing and marketing products with proven clinical evidence that achieve superior effectiveness versus current treatment paradigms while minimizing complications or side effects; 

providing intuitive, patient-friendly, interventional solutions to ophthalmologists and optometrists (together, "ECPs"); and 

delivering compelling economic value to all stakeholders, including patients, providers and third-party payors such as Medicare and commercial insurers. 

O ur initial product development has focused on the treatment of two of the world s most prevalent and underserved eye diseases, glaucoma and dry eye disease DED ). We have commercialized products in each of our two reportable operating segments, Surgical Glaucoma and Dry Eye. Our Surgical Glaucoma revenues consist of sales of the OMNI Surgical System ("OMNI") and the SION Surgical Instrument ("SION"), while our Dry Eye revenues are comprised of sales of the TearCare System ("TearCare"), and related components and accessories. Each product is primarily sold through a highly involved direct sales model that offers intensive education, training and customer service. We believe this philosophy and model not only enable us to differentiate our products and company from competitors, but also expand our addressable market by educating ECPs, patients and other stakeholders on our products and evolving treatment paradigms. Outside of the U.S., we have established direct commercial operations in the United Kingdom and Germany. We sell OMNI in several other countries through distributors. 
 We sell OMNI and SION to facilities where ophthalmic surgeons perform outpatient procedures, such as ambulatory surgery centers ("ASCs") and hospital outpatient departments (" HOPDs"), which are typically reimbursed by Medicare or private payors for procedures using our products. We sell TearCare to ECPs. Currently, there is no meaningful reimbursement coverage by Medicare or private payors for DED procedures, including TearCare, and patients typically pay out-of-pocket for TearCare, although some payors may agree to provide case-based coverage outside of a formal policy. We are continuing our controlled commercial launch and are focused on our comprehensive, clinical data-driven long-term market development plan that aims to improve awareness and patient access to TearCare. We have dedicated meaningful resources to execute our commercial strategy as we reduce operating expenses and improve cost efficiencies to better align our operating structure for long-term, profitable growth. The overall success of our approach to eyecare to date is evidenced by over 275,000 estimated uses of Surgical Glaucoma products and their predicates in over 2,000 hospitals and ASCs in the U.S. and Europe, and over 65,000 estimated uses of TearCare in over 1,500 eyecare facilities in the U.S. through September 30, 2024. 
 We do not currently operate any manufacturing facilities and instead contract with third parties for our production requirements. We believe our suppliers will be able to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing 
 23 

needs across all of our product lines. We plan to continue to utilize third party contract manufacturers for our products and any related components. 
 Revenue in our Surgical Glaucoma segment for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 57.1 million and 57.2 million, respectively, with gross margins for the same periods of 87.6 and 88.1 , respectively. Revenue in our Dry Eye segment for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3.7 million and 5.1 million, respectively, with gross margins for the same periods of 45.8 and 55.4 , respectively. Given the earlier stage of TearCare s commercial development, we expect our Dry Eye segment s gross margins to be lower than our Surgical Glaucoma segment s gross margins for the near and medium-term due to the allocation of fixed labor and overhead costs to the segment's cost of goods sold. In addition, we expect lower demand and related gross margin in the Dry Eye segment in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to our increase in dry eye pricing which took effect on October 1, 2024, which we believe will have a significant impact on cash-pay volumes. We expect TearCare procedure revenues will return to a growth trajectory upon receipt of positive payor coverage determinations that provide for sufficient and equitable reimbursement. We currently anticipate that we and our customers will begin receiving coverage and payment determinations with respect to the TearCare procedure in 2025, though there is no guarantee that such determinations will be made in accordance with this time frame. In the first three quarters of 2024, approximately 95 of our revenue was generated from customers in the U.S. 
 We believe in the importance of continued strategic investment in initiatives that: 
 further demonstrate our products clinical effectiveness and safety to potential customers, patients, payors and regulators including establishing OMNI and SION as standards of care of interventional glaucoma treatment among MIGS-trained surgeons, developing the standalone MIGS market, and pursuing coverage and equitable reimbursement for TearCare; 

enhance our commercial capabilities and expertise, including resources dedicated to sales, marketing and education; 

ensure the broadest possible patient access to the treatment alternatives that our products are cleared to offer; 

enhance and improve upon our existing product technologies; 

develop our existing international markets and expand into new international markets; and 

allow us to create transformational and interventional technology innovation with new products, devices or drugs, in glaucoma and ocular surface disease or in new eye disease areas. 

As a result, we intend to continue to invest in clinical studies, sales and marketing, education initiatives, market access, and product development. However, we are also focused on disciplined expenditures, and seek to grow our operating expenses at a lower rate than revenue. Because of these and other factors, we expect to continue to incur net losses for at least the next several years, and we may seek additional debt and equity financing to fund our operations and planned growth. 
 To date, our primary sources of capital have been private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock, debt financing agreements, the sale of common stock in our IPO, and revenue from the sale of our products. As of September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding term loan balance of 35.0 million (excluding unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs), cash and cash equivalents of 118.6 million and an accumulated deficit of 334.5 million. 
 Factors Affecting Our Business and Results of Operations 
 We believe there are several important factors that have impacted and that will continue to impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Except as described in Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," of this Quarterly Report, and except as described below, there have been no material changes to such factors from those described in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report under the heading "Factors Affecting Our Business and Results of Operations." 
 The availability of sufficient coverage and reimbursement for procedures involving our OMNI technology is fundamental to our business and prospects, with Medicare providing reimbursement for procedures that account for a majority of our revenue. As such, our business and results of operation are in material part dependent upon 
 24 

Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies applicable to OMNI procedures. Recent occurrences that could reasonably be expected to materially impact Medicare coverage and reimbursement for OMNI procedures include the publication in September and October 2024, by five of the seven Medicare Administrative Contractors MACs ), of final local coverage determinations and related final local coverage articles (collectively, the Final LCDs that, once effective, will establish new Medicare coverage policies for phacoemulsification / intraocular lens placement procedures (each, a cataract surgery performed with a single minimally invasive glaucoma surgical ("MIGS") procedure in these MACs' jurisdictions, including both canaloplasty and goniotomy procedures. Unlike the local coverage determinations previously published and later withdrawn by these MACs in 2023, the Final LCDs do not characterize the OMNI procedure as investigational. Accordingly, Medicare coverage for canaloplasty and goniotomy procedures for single MIGS procedures will continue in the states administered by these MACs. The anticipated effective date of the Final LCDs is November 17, 2024. 
 Each of the Final LCDs would adopt a non-coverage policy when an aqueous shunt or stent procedure is performed with another surgical MIGS procedure, such as canaloplasty or goniotomy, at the same time in the same patient eye. We expect that this non-coverage policy for multiple MIGS procedures will reduce overall MIGS procedure volumes in the near-term. Our estimate is that approximately 10 of total MIGS codes billed were done in combination with another MIGS code in the six months ended June 30, 2024. Given OMNI's comprehensive treatment of the conventional outflow pathway, we believe OMNI provides an effective single MIGS procedure option for cases that were previously treated with a combination of MIGS procedures, but we cannot assure you that the Final LCDs will not have an adverse impact on future OMNI sales and therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business and results of operations have also been impacted by recent elevated customer trialing of alternative MIGS products and technologies that are less proven and generally available at lower average selling prices than our OMNI technology. While we believe that the effects of this current customer trialing are transitory, we believe trialing activities in the marketplace will continue and are indicative of increasing competition in the MIGS segment. If we are unable to successfully differentiate and compete against new alternative products, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We currently derive the majority of our U.S. revenue from the sale of our OMNI and SION products to ASCs and HOPDs and our TearCare products to ECPs. To date, the revenue from our Surgical Glaucoma segment has accounted for over 90 of our total revenue, substantially all of which was generated from sales within the U.S. Our Surgical Glaucoma customers place orders based on their expected procedure volume and reorder as needed, typically on a biweekly, monthly or bimonthly basis. Our TearCare customers typically purchase a TearCare System which consists of one or more TearCare SmartHubs SmartHubs ), multiple single-use TearCare SmartLids SmartLids and other accessories. After utilizing their initial inventory, customers can reorder SmartLids as needed. No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The growth in our revenue is driven by the demand for elective surgery and treatment utilizing our products in the United States and Europe. Such demand is often lower during summer months because of ECP vacations and in winter months because of fewer business or surgery days due to holidays and adverse weather conditions. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Our components and products are produced by third-party suppliers and manufacturers. Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of amounts paid for our products to third-party manufacturers, and our manufacturing overhead costs, which consist primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, and reserves for excess, obsolete and non-sellable inventory. Cost of goods sold also includes depreciation expenses for production equipment which we provide to our third-party manufacturers and certain direct costs, such as shipping and handling costs. 
 25 

Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 We calculate gross margin as gross profit divided by revenue. Our gross margin has been and we believe it will continue to be, affected by a variety of factors, including differences in segment gross margins, changes in average selling prices, product sales mix, production and ordering volumes, manufacturing costs, product yields, and headcount. In general, we expect our gross margins to increase over the long term to the extent our production and ordering volumes increase and as we spread the fixed portion of our overhead costs over a larger number of units produced. We intend to use our design, engineering and manufacturing know-how and capabilities to further advance and improve the efficiency of our suppliers manufacturing processes, which we believe will reduce costs and increase our gross margins. Our gross margins could fluctuate from quarter to quarter as our product mix varies, we transition to new suppliers, introduce new products, and adopt new manufacturing processes and technologies. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development ("R D") expenses consist primarily of costs associated with engineering, product development, clinical studies to develop and support our products, including clinical trial design, clinical trial site initiation and study costs, internal and external costs associated with our regulatory compliance and quality assurance functions, medical affairs, cost of products used for clinical trials and other costs associated with products and technologies either new or enhancements of existing platforms that are in development. These expenses also include personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, supplies, consulting, prototyping, testing, materials, travel expenses, depreciation expenses for equipment and an allocation of information technology ("IT") and facility overhead expenses. Our R D expenses as a percentage of revenue may vary over time depending on the level and timing of new product development efforts, as well as clinical development, clinical trial and other related activities. We expect our R D expenses to increase for the next several years as we continue to invest in our active clinical trial programs, develop new products, and improve our existing products. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation related to selling, marketing and corporate functions, allocation of IT and facility overhead expenses, bad debt expense, finance, legal and human resource costs. Other SG A expenses include training, travel expenses, promotional activities, marketing initiatives, market research and analysis, conferences and trade shows, professional services fees (including external legal, audit, consulting and tax fees), insurance costs, and general corporate expenses. 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income primarily consists of interest and amortization on held-to-maturity investments in treasury securities. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists primarily of interest incurred on our outstanding indebtedness and non-cash interest related to the accretion of debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our term loan agreements. 
 Loss on Debt Extinguishment 
 The loss on debt extinguishment is associated with our termination and settlement of the MidCap Term Loan. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net primarily consists of income and expenses that do not originate from our primary business.

15.1 

Revenue . Our Surgical Glaucoma revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 18.6 million, an increase of 0.2 million, or 1.1 , from the prior year comparable period. The overall increase in Surgical Glaucoma revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of OMNI units sold in the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase in units sold was primarily driven by an increase in unit utilization per ordering facility. Our Dry Eye revenue decreased 3.7 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year comparable period primarily due to fewer new customers added in the period, which led to lower SmartHub revenue, partially offset by increased SmartLids purchased prior to our October 1, 2024 price increase. The primary reason that fewer new customers were added was the Company s focus on the next phase of its commercial strategy for its Dry Eye segment which involves achieving reimbursed market access instead of adding customers pursuing a cash pay model for its TearCare products. 
 Cost of Goods Sold . Cost of goods sold was 3.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.6 million from 2.7 million in the prior year comparable period. Our Surgical Glaucoma cost of goods sold increased 0.5 million as compared to the prior year comparable period. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes and higher overhead costs per unit from lower production volumes. Our Dry Eye 
 27 

cost of goods sold increased 0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable period in 2023, primarily driven by higher costs per unit from lower production volumes. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin. Our total gross profit was 16.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.4 million from the prior year comparable period. Our gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 83.9 , from 86.6 in the prior year comparable period, with lower gross margin in both our Surgical Glaucoma and Dry Eye segments, primarily due to higher overhead costs per unit in the current period as a result of lower production volumes in both segments. Gross margin in our Surgical Glaucoma segment was 86.8 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease from 89.1 for the prior year comparable period. In our Dry Eye segment, gross margin decreased from 57.4 in the third quarter of 2023 to 47.7 in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Research and Development Expenses . R D expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.5 million, or 12.0 , to 4.7 million. The increase was primarily driven by a 0.2 million increase in personnel expenses, including corporate bonus and stock-based compensation expenses, as well as a 0.1 million increase in consulting expenses. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . SG A expenses were 23.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 3.1 million from the prior year comparable period. The decrease was primarily driven by a 2.3 million decrease in legal expenses, a 0.7 million decrease in marketing expenses, including sales training, and a 0.1 million decrease in facilities expenses. 
 Investment Income . Investment income was 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decline of 0.4 million from the prior year comparable period. The decline was primarily due to lower investment balances during the current year. 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense decreased 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower lending rates associated with the Hercules Loan Agreement. 
 Loss on Debt Extinguishment. Loss on debt extinguishment was 0.0 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net was income of less than 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to expense of less than 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The overall decrease in Surgical Glaucoma revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of OMNI units sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decline in units sold was primarily driven by a decrease in unit utilization per ordering facility and a lower average selling price primarily due to product mix. Our Dry Eye revenue decreased 1.5 million, or 28.9 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the prior year comparable period primarily due to fewer new customers added in the period, which led to lower SmartHub revenue and fewer SmartLids purchased, partially offset by a higher average selling price for SmartHubs. The primary reason that fewer new customers were added was the Company s focus on the next phase of its commercial strategy for its Dry Eye segment which involves achieving reimbursed market access instead of adding customers pursuing a cash pay model for its TearCare products. 
 Cost of Goods Sold . Cost of goods sold was 9.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of less than 0.1 million from 9.1 million in the prior year comparable period. Our Surgical Glaucoma cost of goods sold increased 0.3 million as compared to the prior year comparable period. The increase was primarily driven by product sales mix and higher per unit cost, partially offset by higher prior year scrap charges. Our Dry Eye cost of goods sold decreased 0.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year comparable period, primarily driven by lower sales volumes and product mix.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin. Our gross profit was 51.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.5 million from the prior year comparable period. Our total gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 85.1 , from 85.4 in the prior year comparable period. Gross margin in our Surgical Glaucoma segment was 87.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease from 88.1 for the prior year comparable period, primarily due to product sales mix and higher cost per unit, partially offset by higher prior year comparable period scrap charges. In our Dry Eye segment, gross margin decreased from 55.4 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 45.8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher overhead costs per unit due to lower volumes. 
 Research and Development Expenses . R D expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.4 million, or 3.1 , to 13.7 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a 0.8 million decrease in clinical studies and general research and development expenses, as well as 0.5 million decrease in payroll expenses. These were partially offset by a 0.4 million increase in professional and outside services, as well as a 0.2 million increase in legal expenses and stock-based compensation expenses. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses . SG A expenses were 76.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 8.6 million from the prior year comparable period. The decrease was primarily driven by a 5.8 million decrease in personnel expenses, including lower commissions during the current period. In addition, there was a 2.9 million decrease in marketing expenses, including sales training and demos, a 1.2 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses, and a 0.7 million decrease in facilities expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a 1.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, as well as a 1.1 million increase in accounting and legal expenses. 
 Investment Income . Investment income was 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decline of 0.9 million from the prior year comparable period. The decline was primarily due to lower investment balances during the current year. 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense decreased 0.6 million, due to lower lending rates associated with the Hercules Loan Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Loss on Debt Extinguishment. Loss on debt extinguishment was 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the current year is driven by our loss on the termination and settlement of the MidCap Term Loan. 
 Other Expense, Net. Other expense, net was expense of less than 0.1 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 18.9 million, consisting of a net loss of 39.7 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of 15.6 million as well as a net change in our operating assets and liabilities of 5.2 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was 
 30 

primarily due to a 1.4 million decrease in accounts receivable, a 1.9 million decrease in our inventory balance, and a 3.4 million increase in accrued compensation. These were partially offset by a 1.5 million decrease in other noncurrent liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of 13.1 million related to stock-based compensation expense, 1.0 million of noncash loss on debt extinguishment, 0.5 million of depreciation and amortization, 0.5 million of noncash operating lease expense, and 0.5 million of accretion of debt discount and debt issuance costs. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 40.7 million, consisting primarily of a net loss of 44.9 million and a net change in our operating assets and liabilities of 9.3 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of 13.5 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a 2.2 million increase in accounts receivable and a 3.3 million increase in inventory to support the continued growth of our operations and increase stocking levels. We had a 0.9 million increase in accounts payable, while accrued compensation and accrued and other current liabilities decreased by an aggregate of 4.9 million, primarily driven by the timing of payments on invoices and bonuses. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of 11.1 million related to stock-based compensation, 0.7 million of noncash operating lease expense, 0.5 million of depreciation, and 0.5 million of accretion of debt discount and debt issuance costs. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.2 million and 0.5 million, respectively, in both cases for purchases of property and equipment. 
 Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.4 million, consisting primarily of the costs associated with our term loan agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. ("Hercules"). Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 0.7 million, which primarily relates to the exercise of common stock options and proceeds from employee stock plan purchases, partially offset by taxes paid on the net share settlement of restricted stock units. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 To date, our primary sources of capital have been private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock, debt financing agreements, the sale of common stock in our IPO, and revenue from the sale of our products. Since our inception, we have raised an aggregate of approximately 402.4 million in net proceeds from sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock and borrowed 32.9 million of net proceeds under our term loans. In January 2024, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Hercules Loan Agreement with Hercules and certain of its affiliates (collectively with Hercules, the Lenders ), which provides for a senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to 65.0 million. We used the proceeds from an initial 35.0 million tranche (the "Initial Loan") funded under the Hercules Loan Agreement to discharge our indebtedness under our prior secured credit facility with MidCap Financial Services and certain of its affiliates (the Prior Lenders ). While our indebtedness to Lenders remains outstanding, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to grant the Lenders the option to invest up to 3.0 million in our next round of equity financing, if any, broadly marketed to multiple investors on the same terms, conditions and pricing offered to investors in such subsequent equity financing. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 118.6 million, an accumulated deficit of 334.5 million and 35.0 million outstanding under the Hercules Term Loan Agreement (before debt discount). Based on our current planned operations, we expect our cash and cash equivalents and additional borrowings available under the Hercules Loan Agreement will enable us to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. 
 Hercules Capital Loan Agreement 
 The Hercules Loan Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to 65.0 million, and the Initial Loan was funded on January 22, 2024. In addition to the Initial Loan, the Hercules Loan Agreement provides for the following tranches: 5.0 million available in a single draw through 
 31 

December 15, 2024, 10.0 million available to draw upon the achievement of certain performance milestones through September 15, 2025, and 15.0 million available for us to draw on through the interest-only period in increments of 5.0 million, subject to the sole approval of Hercules' investment committee (such tranche loans, together with the Initial Loan, the Term Loans ). 
 The Hercules Loan Agreement includes a maturity date of July 1, 2028, with an interest only period running for 30 months, extendable for an additional six months for a total of 36 months upon the achievement of certain milestones. The Term Loans accurate interest at a floating annual rate of the greater of 10.35 or the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus 2.35 , with an interest rate under the Term Loans equal to 10.35 as of September 30, 2024. The final payment fee is set at 5.95 of the funded balance. In conjunction with the funding of the Initial Loan, we issued warrants to the Lenders to purchase up to an aggregate of 135,686 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5.159 per share. Each warrant is exercisable for a period of seven years from the date of issuance and is tradeable in accordance with the provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. 
 Our obligations under the Hercules Loan Agreement are guaranteed by us and our future subsidiaries, subject to exceptions for certain foreign subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets, including our material intellectual property. Additionally, we are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of us to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, make investments, dispose of assets, make acquisitions, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into certain transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain exceptions. We are also subject to certain minimum cash and revenue covenants under the Hercules Loan Agreement. 
 MidCap Loan Agreements 
 In January 2019, we entered into credit and security agreements with the Prior Lenders. These agreements were amended and restated in November 2020, providing for a maximum 40.0 million credit facility consisting of a 35.0 million senior secured term loan (the "2020 Term Loan") and a 5.0 million revolving loan (the "2020 Revolver and together with the 2020 Term Loan, the MidCap Credit Facility ). In July 2023, we terminated the 2020 Revolver. In January 2024, we terminated the Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement (Term Loan) (the MidCap Term Loan Agreement and paid off in full the secured obligations thereunder in connection with our entry into the Hercules Loan Agreement. 
 The MidCap Term Loan Agreement extended the maturity date of the 2020 Term Loan to November 1, 2025 and adjusted the stated floating interest rate to reserve-adjusted SOFR, plus 7.00 . Principal payments under the MidCap Term Loan Agreement were extended and scheduled to begin in December 2024. The final payment fee was amended to 6.0 . 
 Our obligations under the MidCap Term Loan Agreement were guaranteed by us and our future subsidiaries, subject to exceptions for certain foreign subsidiaries. Our obligations under the agreements were secured by substantially all of our assets, including our material intellectual property. Additionally, we were subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limited or restricted our ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, make investments, dispose of assets, make acquisitions, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into certain transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain exceptions. 
 The MidCap Credit Term Loan Agreement contained events of default that included, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, breach of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, cross-defaults and bankruptcy and insolvency events. 
 Leases 
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California, where we lease approximately 11,000 square feet of office, research and development, engineering and laboratory space pursuant to a lease that commenced on August 1, 2021, and expires on October 31, 2026. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. 
 An accounting estimate is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting estimates described in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report under the heading Critical Accounting Estimates . 
 JOBS Act Accounting Election 
 The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies, which may make comparison of our financial statements to those of other public companies more difficult. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report for recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date hereof. 
 Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk. There have been no material changes to such risks from those described in our Annual Report under the heading "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation and supervision of our principal executive officer and our principal financial and accounting officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer, and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 33 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Except as set forth in Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies, in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report, we do not believe we are currently a party to any legal proceedings, regulatory matters, or other disputes or claims which, if determined adversely to us, would, individually or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity or future prospects. However, we may, in the ordinary course of business, face various claims brought by third parties, and we may, from time to time, make claims or take legal actions to assert our rights, including intellectual property rights as well as claims relating to employment matters and the safety or effectiveness of our products. Any of these claims could subject us to costly litigation, and, while we generally believe that we have adequate insurance to cover many different types of liabilities, our insurance carriers may deny coverage, may be inadequately capitalized to pay on valid claims, or our policy limits may be inadequate to fully satisfy any damage awards or settlements. If this were to happen, the payment of any such awards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any such claims, whether or not successful, could damage our reputation and business, and may have an adverse impact on us as a result of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management time and resources, and other factors. 
 Ite m 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Except as set forth below, we are not aware of any material changes to the risks and uncertainties described under the heading "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which are incorporated herein by reference. The risks described below and in our Annual Report and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not the only ones we face. Additional risks we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and future prospects. 
 We may not be able to incrementally secure or maintain adequate levels of third-party coverage and reimbursement for procedures in which our Surgical Glaucoma or Dry Eye products are used, and third parties may rescind or modify their coverage or delay payments related to these products, which will adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We derive revenue from sales of OMNI and SION to physicians, ASCs, and HOPDs, which typically bill all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with our products to various third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, foreign governmental payers, private commercial insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other healthcare-related organizations, and then bill patients for any applicable deductibles or co-payments. As a result, access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures in which our Surgical Glaucoma products are used by third-party payors is essential to their acceptance and adoption by patients and ECPs. Internationally, medical reimbursement systems vary significantly from country to country, with some countries limiting medical centers spending through fixed budgets, regardless of levels of patient treatment, and other countries requiring application for, and approval of, government or third-party reimbursement. For example, in the third quarter of 2024, certain reimbursement guidance in the United Kingdom has caused a shift in perspectives regarding appropriate coding for procedures performed with our OMNI technology. This shift may result in disadvantageous reimbursement for OMNI procedures as compared to historic reimbursement levels, which in turn could materially affect our business, results of operations and prospects in the United Kingdom. 
 These third-party payors continually review new and existing technologies for possible coverage and can deny or reverse coverage for new or existing products and procedures, and there can be no assurance that third-party payor policies provide coverage, or will continue to provide coverage, for procedures in which OMNI or our other products are used. For example, in the U.S., CMS, MACs or commercial payors could require or issue coverage policies that could restrict or eliminate coverage for the patient populations eligible for treatment with our products or that are otherwise unfavorable to our business. In June 2023, for instance, five MACs published proposed local 
 34 

coverage determinations (the Prior LCDs )that proposed to identify certain non-implantable MIGS procedures as investigational and not reasonable and necessary in the jurisdictions where these MACS administer Medicare Part B benefits, including but not limited to adult canaloplasty in combination with trabeculotomy ab interno, a procedure performed with OMNI and for which it is indicated. The Prior LCDs may also have categorized our SION technology as investigational and thus non-covered with respect to goniotomy procedures. The Prior LCDs were withdrawn in late December 2023, prior to becoming effective, and then replaced with updated LCDs issued in late September and early October 2024 (the Final LCDs that are scheduled to become effective in November 2024. The Final LCDs allow for continued coverage of canaloplasty and goniotomy procedures performed with our OMNI and SION technologies in these five MAC jurisdictions. However, each of the Final LCDs will adopt a non-coverage policy when an aqueous shunt or stent procedure is performed with another surgical MIGS procedure, such as canaloplasty or goniotomy, at the same time in the same patient eye. We estimate that approximately 10 of total MIGS codes billed in the six months ended June 30, 2024 were done in combination with another MIGS code and expect the non-coverage determination for multiple MIGS procedures will reduce overall MIGS procedure volumes. 
 In the future, governmental or private payers may issue coverage policies or guidance that may establish non-coverage, materially restrict coverage, or reduce reimbursement levels for one or more of our products. Any such policies, determinations or guidance could in turn influence coverage determinations by other third-party payors. If we are not successful in reversing any proposed non-coverage policies, or if third-party payors that currently cover or reimburse procedures in which our products are used reverse or limit their coverage in the future, or if other third-party payors issue similar policies, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, any uncertainty with respect to coverage or coding may impact management s ability to accurately forecast results. 
 We also derive revenue from sales of TearCare to ECPs and eye care clinics, which bill all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with treatments and products to patients or, on a limited basis, to third-party payors. We believe that access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures in which TearCare is used by third-party payors is important to the broad acceptance and adoption of TearCare. Currently, no MACs have formal policies establishing coverage for the TearCare procedure; however, MACs from time to time may include, and we are currently aware of three MACs that have included, low payment rates for TearCare procedures in their fee schedules that, if not removed or increased to what we believe is an appropriate reimbursement level, could adversely impact our efforts to achieve reimbursement for TearCare that is sufficient to support its broad commercial growth and adoption. Further, commercial payors may from time to time make no coverage or similar determinations with respect to our TearCare product that could hamper our efforts to drive broad commercial adoption of TearCare. We are pursuing a comprehensive long-term market development and patient access plan for TearCare and focusing our efforts on partnering with key strategic accounts to pursue prior authorization approvals and reimbursement claims for procedures in which TearCare is used, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful. If patients are not willing to pay for procedures in which TearCare is used, or if third-party payors continue to refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement, or provide insufficient levels of coverage and reimbursement, it could have a negative impact on ECPs adoption of TearCare and sales of TearCare, which could adversely affect our business. 
 Third-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Obtaining and maintaining coverage and reimbursement can be a time-consuming process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to satisfy governmental and third-party payors that procedures using our products should be covered and reimbursed. With regard to our international sales efforts, even if and as we succeed in bringing our products to market in foreign countries, uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy, legislation and regulation, as well as private market practices, could affect our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities at acceptable prices. 
 In the United States, the AMA generally assigns specific billing codes for procedures under a coding system known as Current Procedure Terminology CPT ), which surgeons use to bill third-party payors and receive reimbursement. Once a permanent CPT code ("Category I CPT code") is established for a service, CMS establishes payment levels under Medicare, while other payors may establish rates and coverage rules independently. Canaloplasty followed by trabeculotomy procedures using OMNI are typically billed using the Category I CPT code 66174, which describes canaloplasty. Coding for ophthalmic surgical procedures is complex, and changes to the codes used to report services performed with our products may result in significant changes in reimbursement, 
 35 

which could negatively impact our revenue. For example, in 2021 the RVS Update Committee ("RUC") of the AMA reevaluated the physician work associated with CPT code 66174. As a result of this RUC review and further conversion factor reductions, CMS reduced the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule amount associated with this service from approximately 950 in 2021, to 761 in 2022, to 622 in 2023, to 608 in 2024 and to 600 in 2025. Many of the factors considered by the RUC, and many of the factors evaluated by payors and other payor advisory bodies, in assessing the costs of, and payments with respect to, procedures associated with our products are not within our control. For instance, with respect to determination of hospital, ASC and physician payment associated with CPT code 66174, evaluation of procedure costs may include the costs of competitive products that are priced well below our products, and may also reflect reduced physician work with respect to procedures that are less comprehensive than the procedures performed with OMNI. This, in turn, may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain adequate and appropriate levels of reimbursement for the comprehensive procedure enabled by our OMNI technology, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 The AMA maintains a subset of temporary CPT codes ("Category III CPT codes") used for new and emerging technologies. For example, TearCare was assigned a Category III CPT code effective beginning January 1, 2020. Coverage for Category III CPT codes is often limited. Medicare does not generally establish national payment rates for Category III CPT codes on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule ("MPFS"). As a result, individual Medicare contractors and private payors may establish their own payment rates for services described by Category III CPT codes, as has been the case with TearCare, which payment rates are subject to change, may be variable across Medicare contractors, may be materially below the final reimbursement rates that we are currently targeting, or may determine not to reimburse services described by Category III CPT codes. 
 Further, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions, such as additional prior authorization requirements, both in the United States and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our products or any of our products in development for which we may receive regulatory clearance, certification or approval may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets. Further, other devices or treatments that compete with our products may be more widely covered or subject to different co-pay policies and requirements, which could impact demand for our products. If hospital, surgical center, ECP and/or patient demand for our products is adversely affected by third-party reimbursement policies and decisions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The market for our products is highly competitive. Our competitors may have longer operating histories, more established products and greater resources than we do, and may be able to develop or market treatments that are safer, more effective or gain greater acceptance in the marketplace than our products. 
 The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by the introduction of new products and technologies and the other activities of industry participants. We compete, or plan to compete, with medical device and pharmaceutical companies that develop and commercialize products for eye conditions, including Glaukos, AbbVie/Allergan, Novartis, Alcon, Johnson Johnson, Nova Eye Medical, and New World Medical. These companies, or other entrants into the market, may have or develop competing technologies, other products that are in or that enter clinical trials, new devices or additional indications for existing devices that could demonstrate better safety, effectiveness, clinical results, lower costs or greater ECP and market acceptance than our products. For example, there has been a recent increase in ECP trialing of alternative products that are offered at lower prices than OMNI, which we believe has had a near-term adverse impact on utilization of OMNI. Though in the past, we viewed such ECP trialing and use of alternative devices as temporary and not material to the continued growth of OMNI sales, we cannot guarantee that this has continued or will continue to remain the case. Sustained increases in ECP use of alternative MIGS devices could result in reduced OMNI sales and revenue growth or even loss of market share, which would adversely impact our competitive position, business and results of operations. In addition, despite what we believe to be the strong safety profile of our products for their intended uses, patients may experience adverse events following canaloplasty or trabeculotomy with OMNI, including, but not limited to, hyphema, mild anterior chamber inflammation and spikes in intraocular pressure. Similarly, patients may experience adverse events following use of the SION surgical instrument, including anterior chamber shallowing and prolonged, or persistent intraocular inflammation, or application of localized heat with TearCare, including discomfort, pain or erythema of the eyelids. Any failure to meet customer and patient expectations and any resulting negative perceptions or publicity could harm our reputation and future sales and therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 36 

We compete, or may compete in the future, against other companies which have longer, more established operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution and other resources, which may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration or improved operating results. These companies may enjoy several competitive advantages, including: 
 Established treatment patterns pursuant to which prescription medications, traditional glaucoma surgery or more conventional MIGS procedures are generally first-line therapies for the treatment of glaucoma and eye drops or warm-compresses are first-line therapies for the treatment of MGD; 

Established relationships with ECPs who are familiar with their products and procedures for the treatment of glaucoma or MGD; 

Established relationships with key stakeholders, including hospital outpatient departments, ambulatory surgery centers, optometrists and ophthalmologists, general practitioners and administrators; 

Greater financial and human capital resources; 

Significantly greater name recognition; 

Additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and 

Established sales, marketing and worldwide distribution networks. 

One of the major hurdles to adoption of our products will be overcoming established treatment patterns, which will require educating ECPs and supportive clinical data. However, because of the size of the market opportunity for devices used in procedures to address MIGS and MGD, we believe current and potential future competitors will dedicate significant resources to aggressively promote their products or develop new products or treatments, such as Glaukos iStent technologies, iPRIME Viscodelivery System, and iDose TR intraocular implant; Alcon s Hydrus MicroStent; and various canaloplasty devices including Nova Eye s iTrack Advance. Further, new treatment options may be developed that could compete more effectively with our products due to the prevalence of glaucoma and MGD, and the research and technological progress that exist within the market. Also, even if competitor products do not have indications for use or clinical data that are comparable to ours, ECPs can still choose these competitor products for a variety of reasons, including those set forth above. For instance, competitors may seek to bundle their products in a manner that is attractive to ECPs, which may result in decreased use or adoption of our products by ECPs, notwithstanding that our products may offer superior efficacy. 
 We rely on third parties to manufacture and supply our products, many of which are single-source providers and certain of which are located outside the U.S., and we are subject to numerous risks relating to our reliance on these parties. 
 Our business strategy depends on our ability to manufacture our current and future products in sufficient quantities, on terms that are acceptable to us, and on a timely basis to meet customer demand, while adhering to product quality standards, complying with regulatory quality system requirements, and managing manufacturing costs. We do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities or infrastructure and rely on a limited number of third-party manufacturers, many of which are single-source suppliers, and certain of which are located outside the U.S., for the components, accessories, materials and assembly that we utilize in our products. These items are critical and, for certain items, there are relatively few or no readily available alternative sources of supply. These single-source suppliers may be unwilling or unable to supply these items reliably and at the levels we anticipate or that are required by the market, or we may be unable to purchase these items on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. 
 Our ability to obtain products and components in sufficient quantities from these suppliers may be limited for several reasons, including their financial difficulties, damage to their manufacturing equipment or facilities, inability to obtain components, problems with their own suppliers, our relative importance as a customer to each manufacturer. In addition, geopolitical or trade tensions between China and Taiwan or China and the United States, or potential tariffs, could increase the cost of our products or components, and materially and adversely affect our business operations and financial condition. For example, a significant portion of our OMNI and SION products, and certain of our TearCare system components, are produced and assembled by a single Taiwan-based manufacturer in China, and there is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. 
 37 

and China with respect to trade policies, government regulations, and tariffs, and such uncertainty could continue in future periods. 
 There has been increasing discussion from U.S. and foreign leaders regarding the possibility of instituting tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials. The institution of trade tariffs between the U.S. and China specifically could cause a significant increase in the cost of our products and the components for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. To mitigate these risks, we have also contracted with a U.S.-based manufacturer to produce and assemble OMNI products, and have supply arrangements with other suppliers for the production of certain TearCare system components. However, for our business strategy to be successful, our suppliers must be able to provide us with products in sufficient quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements, including the FDA s QSR or other applicable laws or regulations enforced by the FDA, state and foreign regulatory authorities, in accordance with agreed-upon specifications, at acceptable costs and on a timely basis, and tariffs or a trade war could materially and adversely impact our ability to do so. If we are unable to meet our demand requirements on a timely basis, we may not have a sufficient number of our products available for delivery to support ECPs that utilize our products as part of their treatment. For instance, if our supply of OMNI products from our manufacturer in China was interrupted or suspended for any significant period, or tariffs that affect our products or components were imposed by the United States, we may be unable to meet customer demand for our OMNI products during that time. Any shortfall in the supply of products may result in lower adoption and usage rates of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The process of identifying and qualifying alternative manufacturing facilities for any other reason could be time-consuming and expensive, may result in interruptions in our operations and product delivery, and could affect the performance specifications of our products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and engage alternative contract manufacturers on terms similar to our current arrangements, or without delay. Furthermore, our contract manufacturers could require that their manufacture and assembly of our products be moved to another of their production facilities. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our ability to meet the demand for our products in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are also subject to numerous other risks relating to our reliance on third parties, including potential quality issues at our suppliers' manufacturing facilities with respect to our products, and our potential inability to renew or extend contracts and arrangements with such third parties or renew any such contracts or arrangements on terms that are favorable to us, and price fluctuations due to a lack of long-term supply agreements with certain of our suppliers. These risks are likely to be exacerbated by our limited experience with our current products and manufacturing processes. As demand for our products increases, we will have to invest additional resources to manage the manufacturing process. If we fail to secure increased production capacity efficiently, we may not be able to fill customer orders on a timely basis, our sales may not increase in line with our expectations and our operating margins could fluctuate or decline. In addition, the manufacture of future products may require modification of the current production processes or unique production processes, the identification of new suppliers for specific components, sub-assemblies and materials or the development of new manufacturing technologies. It may not be possible for our current third-party manufacturers to produce these products at a cost or in quantities sufficient to make these products commercially viable or to maintain current operating margins, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
