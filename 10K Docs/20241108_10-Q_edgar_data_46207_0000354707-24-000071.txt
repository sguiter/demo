CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report and other presentations made by Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) and Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. (Hawaiian Electric) and their subsidiaries contain forward-looking statements, which include statements that are predictive in nature, depend upon or refer to future events or conditions and usually include words such as will, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, predicts, estimates or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance, ongoing business strategies or prospects or possible future actions are also forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and the accuracy of assumptions concerning HEI and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company), the performance of the industries in which they do business and economic, political and market factors, among other things. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. 
 Risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements and from historical results include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 the impact of the Maui windstorm and wildfires including the potential liabilities from the many lawsuits filed against the Company and the Utilities and potential regulatory penalties which may result in significant costs that may be unrecoverable (or not reimbursed on a timely basis) through insurance and/or rates; 
 an increase in insurance premiums and the inability to fully recover premiums through rates or the potential inability to obtain wildfire and general liability insurance coverage at reasonable rates, if available at all; 
 the uncertainties surrounding the Company s and the Utilities access to capital and credit markets due to the uncertainties associated with the costs related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires; 
 the ability to raise the amount of capital necessary on reasonable terms, if at all, for the Company s and the Utilities contribution to the Maui wildfire tort litigation settlement in order to alleviate future conditions that may cause substantial doubt about HEI s and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern; 
 potential further dilution to existing shareholders if the Company raises funds by issuing additional equity or equity-linked securities; 
 the inability to execute financing plans to alleviate future conditions that may cause substantial doubt about HEI s and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern prior to the issuance of their respective annual financial statements, which could result in an event of default and an acceleration of the Company s and the Utilities debt and lead to filing for bankruptcy protection if waivers from lenders are not received; 
 extreme weather events, including windstorms and other natural disasters, particularly those driven or exacerbated by climate change, which could increase the risk of the Utilities equipment being damaged, becoming inoperable or contributing to a wildfire; 
 the continued suspension, material reduction or extended delay in dividends or other distributions from one or more operating subsidiaries to HEI; 
 further downgrades by securities rating agencies in their ratings of the securities of HEI and Hawaiian Electric and their impact on results of financing efforts; 
 the risks of suffering losses and incurring liabilities that are uninsured (e.g., damages to the Utilities transmission and distribution system and losses from business interruption) or underinsured (e.g., losses not covered as a result of insurance deductibles or other exclusions or exceeding policy limits), and the risks associated with the operation of transmission and distribution assets and power generation facilities, including public and employee safety issues, and assets causing or contributing to wildfires; 
 international, national and local economic and political conditions including the state of the Hawaii tourism, defense and construction industries; the strength or weakness of the Hawaii and continental U.S. real estate markets (including the fair value and/or the actual performance of collateral underlying loans held by ASB, which could result in higher loan loss provisions and write-offs); decisions concerning the extent of the presence of the federal government and military in Hawaii; the implications and potential impacts of future federal government shutdowns, including the impact to the Utilities customers ability to pay their electric bills and/or bank loans and the impact on the State of Hawaii economy; the implications and potential impacts of U.S. and foreign capital and credit market conditions and federal, state and international responses to those conditions; the potential impacts of global and local developments (including global economic conditions and uncertainties, unrest, terrorist acts, wars, conflicts, political protests, deadly virus epidemic or other crisis); the effects of changes that have or may occur in U.S. policy, such as with respect to immigration and trade; and pandemics; 
 the ability to adequately address risks and capitalize on opportunities related to the Company s and the Utilities environmental, social and governance priority areas, which include safety, reliability and resilience, including relating to wildfires and other extreme weather events, decarbonization, economic health and affordability, secure digitalization, diversity, equity and inclusion, employee engagement, and climate-related risks and opportunities; 
 citizen activism, including civil unrest, especially in times of severe economic depression and social divisiveness, which could negatively impact customers and employees, impair the ability of the Company and the Utilities to operate and maintain their facilities in an effective and safe manner, and citizen or stakeholder activism that could delay the construction, increase project costs or preclude the completion of third-party or Utility projects that are required to meet electricity demand, resilience and reliability objectives and renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and other climate-related goals; 
 v 

the effects of future actions or inaction of the U.S. government or related agencies, including those related to the U.S. debt ceiling or budget funding, monetary policy, trade policy and tariffs, energy and environmental policy, and other policy and regulatory changes advanced or proposed by President Biden and his administration; 
 weather, natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, lightning strikes, lava flows and the increasing effects of climate change, such as more severe storms, flooding, droughts, heat waves, and rising sea levels) and wildfires, including their impact on the resilience and reliability and cost of the Company s and Utilities operations, collateral underlying ASB loans and the economy; 
 the timing, speed and extent of changes in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, which could result in lower portfolio yields and net interest margin, or higher borrowing costs; 
 changes in interest rates and market liquidity, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources, alter valuations and affect the ability to originate and distribute financial products in the primary and secondary markets; 
 the continued ability of the Company and the Utilities to access the credit and capital markets (e.g., to obtain commercial paper and other short-term and long-term debt financing, including lines of credit, and, in the case of HEI, to issue common stock) under volatile and challenging market conditions, and the potential higher cost of such financings, if available; 
 the risks inherent in changes in the value of the Company s pension and other retirement plan assets and ASB s securities available for sale, and the risks inherent in changes in the value of the Company s pension liabilities, including changes driven by interest rates and mortality improvements; 
 changes in laws, regulations (including tax regulations), market conditions, interest rates and other factors that result in changes in assumptions used to calculate retirement benefits costs and funding requirements; 
 increasing competition in the banking industry from traditional financial institutions as well as from non-traditional providers of financial services, including financial service subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies (e.g., increased price competition for loans and deposits, or an outflow of deposits to alternative investments or platforms, which may have an adverse impact on ASB s net interest margin and portfolio growth); 
 the potential delay by the Public Utilities Commission of the State of Hawaii (PUC) in considering (and potential disapproval of actual or proposed) renewable energy or resilience proposals, among others, and related costs; reliance by the Utilities on outside parties such as the state, independent power producers (IPPs) and developers; supply-chain challenges; and uncertainties surrounding technologies, solar power, wind power, biofuels, environmental assessments required to meet RPS and other climate-related goals; the impacts of implementation of the renewable energy and resilience proposals on future costs of electricity and potential penalties imposed by the PUC for delays in the commercial operations of renewable energy projects; 
 the ability of the Utilities to develop, implement and recover the costs of implementing the Utilities action plans included in their updated Power Supply Improvement Plans, Demand Response Portfolio Plan, Distributed Generation Interconnection Plan, Grid Modernization Plans, and business model changes, which have been and are continuing to be developed and updated in response to the orders issued by the PUC, the PUC s April 2014 statement of its inclinations on the future of Hawaii s electric utilities and the vision, business strategies and regulatory policy changes required to align the Utilities business model with customer interests and the state s public policy goals, and subsequent orders of the PUC; 
 the ability of the Utilities to recover undepreciated cost of fossil fuel generating units, if they are required to be retired before the end of their expected useful life; 
 capacity and supply constraints or difficulties, especially if generating units (utility-owned or IPP-owned) fail or measures such as demand-side management, distributed generation, combined heat and power or other firm capacity supply-side resources fall short of achieving their forecasted benefits or are otherwise insufficient to reduce or meet peak demand; 
 high and/or volatile fuel prices, which increases working capital requirements and customer bills, or delivery of adequate fuel by suppliers (including as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war and conflict in the Middle East), which could affect the reliability of utility operations, and the continued availability to the electric utilities of their energy cost recovery clauses (ECRCs); 
 the continued availability to the electric utilities or modifications of other cost recovery mechanisms, including the purchased power adjustment clauses (PPACs), annual revenue adjustment (ARA) and pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) tracking mechanisms, and the continued decoupling of revenues from sales to mitigate the effects of declining kilowatt-hour sales; 
 the ability of the Utilities to recover increasing or additional costs and earn a reasonable return on capital investments not covered by the ARA, while providing the customer dividend required by performance-based regulation (PBR); 
 the impact from the PUC s implementation of PBR for the Utilities pursuant to Act 005, Session Laws 2018, including the potential addition of new performance incentive mechanisms (PIMs), third-party proposals adopted by the PUC in its implementation of PBR, and the implications of not achieving performance incentive goals; 
 the impact of fuel price levels and volatility on customer satisfaction and political and regulatory support for the Utilities; 
 unfavorable changes in economic conditions, such as sustained inflation, higher interest rates or recession, may negatively impact the ability of the Company s customers to pay their utility bills or loan payments, reduce loan production, and increase operating costs of the Utilities or Bank that cannot be passed on to, or recovered, from customers; 
 the risks associated with increasing reliance on renewable energy, including the availability and cost of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable energy generation and the operational and related cost impacts of adding intermittent sources of renewable energy to the electric grid; 
 the growing risk that energy production from renewable generating resources may be curtailed and the interconnection of additional resources will be constrained as more generating resources are added to the Utilities electric systems and as customers reduce their energy usage; 
 the ability of IPPs to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in their power purchase agreements (PPAs); 
 vi 

the potential that, as IPP contracts near the end of their terms, there may be less economic incentive for the IPPs to make investments in their units to ensure the availability of their units; 
 the ability of the Utilities to negotiate, periodically, favorable agreements for significant resources such as fuel supply contracts and collective bargaining agreements and avoid or mitigate labor disputes and work stoppages; 
 new technological developments that could affect the operations and prospects of the Utilities and ASB or their competitors such as the commercial development of energy storage and microgrids and banking through alternative channels, including use of digital currencies, which could include a central bank digital currency; 
 cybersecurity risks and the potential for cyber incidents, including potential incidents at HEI, its subsidiaries (including at ASB branches and electric utility plants), its third-party service providers, contractors and customers with whom they have shared data (IPPs, distributed energy resources (DER) aggregators and customers enrolled under DER programs) and incidents at data processing centers used, to the extent not prevented by intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, firewalls and other general IT controls; 
 failure to achieve remaining cost savings commitment related to the management audit committed savings of 33 million over the 2021 to 2025 multi-year rate period (MRP); 
 federal, state, county and international governmental and regulatory actions, such as existing, new and changes in laws, rules and regulations applicable to HEI, the Utilities and ASB (including changes in taxation and tax rates, increases in capital requirements, regulatory policy changes, environmental laws and regulations (including resulting compliance costs and risks of fines and penalties and/or liabilities), the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, governmental fees and assessments (such as Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments), and potential carbon pricing or cap and trade legislation that may fundamentally alter costs to produce electricity and accelerate the move to renewable generation); 
 developments in laws, regulations and policies governing protections for historic, archaeological and cultural sites, and plant and animal species and habitats, as well as developments in the implementation and enforcement of such laws, regulations and policies; 
 discovery of conditions that may be attributable to historical chemical releases, including any necessary investigation and remediation, and any associated enforcement, litigation or regulatory oversight; 
 decisions by the PUC in rate cases and other proceedings (including the risks of delays in the timing of decisions, adverse changes in final decisions from interim decisions and the disallowance of project costs as a result of adverse regulatory audit reports or otherwise); 
 decisions by the PUC and by other agencies and courts on land use, environmental and other permitting issues (such as required corrective actions, restrictions and penalties that may arise, such as with respect to environmental conditions or RPS); 
 potential enforcement actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and/or other governmental authorities (such as consent orders, required corrective actions, restrictions and penalties that may arise, for example, with respect to compliance deficiencies under existing or new banking and consumer protection laws and regulations or with respect to capital adequacy); 
 the risks associated with the geographic concentration of HEI s businesses and ASB s loans, ASB s concentration in a single product type (i.e., first mortgages) and ASB s significant credit relationships (i.e., concentrations of large loans and/or credit lines with certain customers); 
 changes in accounting principles applicable to HEI and its subsidiaries, including the adoption of new U.S. accounting standards, the potential discontinuance of regulatory accounting related to PBR or other regulatory changes, the effects of potentially required consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs), or required finance lease or on-balance-sheet operating lease accounting for PPAs with IPPs; 
 faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause a decrease in net interest income and portfolio yields, an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage-servicing assets of ASB; 
 changes in ASB s loan portfolio credit profile and asset quality and/or mix, which may increase or decrease the required level of provision for credit losses, allowance for credit losses (ACL) and charge-offs; 
 changes in ASB s deposit levels, cost or mix which may have an adverse impact on ASB s cost of funds; 
 the final outcome of tax positions taken by HEI and its subsidiaries; 
 the ability of the Company s non-regulated subsidiary, Pacific Current, LLC (Pacific Current), to achieve its performance and growth objectives, which in turn could affect its ability to service its non-recourse debt; 
 the Company s reliance on third parties and the risk of their non-performance; and 
 other risks or uncertainties described elsewhere in this report and in other reports (e.g., Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K) previously and subsequently filed by HEI and/or Hawaiian Electric with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the report, presentation or filing in which they are made. Except to the extent required by the federal securities laws, HEI, Hawaiian Electric, ASB, Pacific Current and their subsidiaries undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

 Note 1 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the following notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in HEI s and Hawaiian Electric s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 In the opinion of HEI s and Hawaiian Electric s management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all material adjustments required by GAAP to fairly state consolidated HEI s and Hawaiian Electric s financial positions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the results of their operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed below or in other referenced material. Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. 
 
 million and billion, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Utilities incurred net losses of approximately million and billion, respectively. The net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to the accruals of estimated wildfire liabilities in the second and third quarters of 2024, totaling approximately billion related to the Maui windstorm and wildfire tort-related legal claims (see Note 2). 
 When preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, management has the responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about HEI s and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. In making its evaluation, the Company considers, among other things, risks and/or uncertainties related to its results of operations, contractual obligations, including near-term debt maturities, dividend requirements, debt covenant compliance, or other factors impacting the Company s liquidity and capital resources. 
 The Company previously concluded that as of June 30, 2024, conditions existed that raised substantial doubt about HEI s and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern, and that while HEI and the Utilities were working with their financial advisors on a financing plan to raise the capital necessary to mitigate those conditions, there was no assurance that management s plans would be successful. As a result, HEI and the Utilities disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2024 there was substantial doubt about HEI s and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern. 
 As a discussed in Note 2, in the third quarter of 2024, after working with its financial advisors on various financing plans, the Company determined it would pay the proposed settlement in equal annual installments. The Utilities revised their total settlement accrual to billion, classifying the first million installment as a current liability based on expected timing of the payment and the remaining billion as a non-current liability on the Utilities Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. To finance the first installment payment, in September 2024, HEI completed the sale of million shares of common stock in a registered offering, raising net proceeds of approximately million. In addition, HEI filed with the SEC an at-the-market (ATM) offering program under which HEI may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, its common stock, without par value, having an aggregate offering price of up to million. To date, HEI has not sold any common stock under this program. 
 Management believes that HEI s and the Utilities current cash balances, excluding ASB, as of September 30, 2024, amounting to million and million, respectively, the available capacity on Hawaiian Electric s ABL facility (see Note 6), the additional liquidity from HEI s recently registered ATM program, and expenditure reduction efforts, provide sufficient liquidity to alleviate the conditions that caused the substantial doubt about HEI s and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, HEI has agreed to transfer the amount of the first payment, million, into a new subsidiary, which is restricted from disbursing such funds except in connection with the initial payments to the settlement funds. HEI expects to make this initial payment in late 2025 and HEI and the Utilities have sufficient resources to fund their operations and satisfy their other obligations for the next 12 months following the issuances of their financial statements. The plans that have been implemented have mitigated the conditions that previously caused the substantial doubt about HEI and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern as of the date of filing their 2024 second quarter financial statements.

 HEI s and the Utilities future results of operations involve significant risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect HEI s and the Utilities future operating results and could cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, access to capital, ability to attract and retain key personnel, and pending or threatened litigation (including recent litigation noted above).

 million of certain incremental costs related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires to a regulatory asset. 
 The Utilities are actively seeking recovery of damage to covered electrical infrastructure under their property insurance programs. The Utilities have submitted claims, received and recorded the insurance recoveries of million in October 2024; however, the timing and amount of any future insurance recoveries remain indeterminable at this time and as such, an insurance

 million with a million retention for damages related to Utility-owned non-generating assets, including overhead transmission and distribution assets within 1,000 feet of such assets. The Utilities believe capital expenditures related to restoration that are not covered by insurance will be managed under their current regulatory mechanisms, the recovery of which would be subject to PUC approval. 
 ASB s Lahaina branch, including most of its contents and automated teller machine, was destroyed in the fire. The Bank leased the property of its Lahaina location. 
 Third-party claims and other proceedings. 
 Tort-related legal claims . As of November 4, 2024, HEI and the Utilities have each been named in approximately lawsuits related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires. These civil and class action lawsuits are pending in the Maui Circuit Court against HEI, the Utilities, and other defendants, including the County of Maui, the State of Hawaii and related state entities, private landowners and developers, and telecommunications companies (collectively, tort-related legal claims). class action is also pending in federal court. Most of these lawsuits allege that the defendants were responsible for, and/or negligent in failing to prevent or respond to the wildfires that led to the property destruction and loss of life. Other claims include, among other things, personal injury, wrongful death, emotional distress and inverse condemnation. lawsuit asserting similar theories and claims was filed by the County of Maui against HEI and the Utilities, lawsuit was filed by Spectrum Oceanic, LLC against HEI and the Utilities and other defendants, and other lawsuits were filed by approximately subrogation insurers against HEI, the Utilities, a private landowner, and telecommunications companies. Additional lawsuits may be filed against the Company and other defendants in the future. The plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, including punitive damages. Defendants have asserted cross-claims against one another for indemnification, contribution, and subrogation. 
 The County of Maui Origin and Cause Report, released on October 2, 2024, attaching the investigative report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, estimated the total economic damage of approximately 6 billion. That estimate has not been validated by the Company, and it represents a gross number that does not take into account causation or liability and does not attempt to allocate responsibility among the various defendants. As such, the estimate is not intended to provide a reasonably possible loss in excess of the recorded amount under ASC Topic 450-20, Loss Contingencies attributable to the Company arising from the Maui windstorm and wildfires. 
 On November 8, 2023, Hawaii Governor Josh Green announced the One Ohana Initiative (the One Ohana Initiative as a collective path forward to recovery from the Maui windstorm and wildfires. The One Ohana Initiative is a new humanitarian aid fund of million, with the objective to compensate, in an expedited manner, those who have lost loved ones and those who have suffered severe injuries in the Maui windstorm and wildfires. The One Ohana Initiative provides an alternative to a lengthy and expensive legal process. Beneficiaries who have lost loved ones are anticipated to receive payments of million per decedent, and those who suffered severe injuries are expected to share in a specially allocated pool of compensation. In exchange for receiving such a payment, beneficiaries will be required to waive their ability to pursue legal claims for wrongful death and severe injuries, except if they seek compensation through the litigation settlement. Hawaiian Electric fully supports this humanitarian initiative and has contributed million. The Governor announced that other parties, including the State of Hawaii, the County of Maui, and Kamehameha Schools have all agreed to contribute to the fund. Hawaiian Electric s contribution to the Initiative was less than half of the total, and Hawaiian Electric's insurance carriers funded its share of the contributions to the fund. Hawaiian Electric s contribution is reflective of its commitment to join with community partners to provide solutions to promote Maui s recovery. Hawaiian Electric s commitment to contribute to the One Ohana Initiative is not an admission of guilt or reflection of fault or liability related to the wildfires. Under the One Ohana Initiative , all claimants (except families of missing persons) were required to submit a completed registration form and registrants who meet the Fund s eligibility requirements then were required to complete and submit a claim form. As of the claim-submission deadline of July 15, 2024, claim forms were received that relate to death claims and claim forms were received that relate to physical injury claims. The One Ohana Initiative will retain its separate existence and claimants eligible will be required to apply to the One Ohana Initiative before obtaining benefits from the litigation settlement. 
 Effective November 1, 2024, HEI and Hawaiian Electric entered into definitive settlement agreements (collectively, the Settlement Agreements) to settle the tort-related legal claims in the litigation arising out of the Maui windstorm and wildfires (expressly excluding securities and derivative actions) on a global basis without any admission of liability. Under the Settlement Agreements, subject to certain conditions (including those described below), HEI and Hawaiian Electric, along with other defendants (the State of Hawaii, the County of Maui, Kamehameha Schools, entities affiliated with the West Maui Land Co., Hawaiian Telcom, and Spectrum/Charter Communications) have agreed to settle the claims of those who filed lawsuits in state and federal courts, or who may have claims but have not yet filed lawsuits, in connection with the Maui windstorm and wildfires. One Settlement Agreement is between the defendants, class counsel, and class plaintiffs (the Class Settlement 
 15 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Unaudited) continued 

 lawyers representing numerous individual plaintiffs who have brought their own lawsuits (the Individual Settlement Agreement). The Settlement Agreements do not resolve claims with insurers who have asserted or could assert subrogation claims in separate lawsuits and such insurers are not parties to the Settlement Agreements, but resolving such claims in the manner set forth in the Settlement Agreements (described below) is a condition that must be satisfied before any payment is due from the defendants. Both Settlement Agreements remain subject to court approval and other conditions, including those set out below. 
 Under the Settlement Agreements, HEI and Hawaiian Electric are obligated to contribute a total of billion (out of a total defendant contribution of approximately billion), which includes million previously contributed for the One Ohana Initiative , which is to be divided between two settlement funds, one for the benefit of individual plaintiffs, and the other for the benefit of the class plaintiffs. HEI and Hawaiian Electric must pay such amounts in equal annual installments of million, with the first installment expected to be made in late 2025. HEI and Hawaiian Electric have the option to accelerate the payments, in whole or in part, with such accelerated payments to be discounted at a rate of per annum. HEI has agreed to transfer the amount of the first payment, million, into a new subsidiary, which is restricted from disbursing such funds except in connection with the initial payments to the settlement funds. Additionally, under the Settlement Agreements, HEI and Hawaiian Electric are obligated to contribute a share to the settlement administration fees only if certain other sources are exhausted when those fees are due, for which, million was accrued as of September 30, 2024 based on the best estimate at this time. 
 The Settlement Agreements are intended to resolve all of the tort-related legal claims related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires. The Class Settlement Agreement provides releases by plaintiffs to the defendants, and among defendants, for acts and omissions relating to the Maui windstorm and wildfires. The Individual Settlement Agreement provides that individual plaintiffs who elect to accept the settlement will sign releases. The releases in the Settlement Agreements, including those among defendants (subject to certain conditions), are effective on the initial payment due date. The Settlement Agreements also provide that million of the total settlement payments will be reserved and made available to defendants to defray the cost to resolve any claims brought by nonparticipating plaintiffs. Defendants have the right to terminate the Settlement Agreements under certain circumstances, including if more than specified thresholds of plaintiffs choose not to participate in the settlement. 
 The Settlement Agreements contain multiple conditions that must be met before any payment from HEI and Hawaiian Electric to the settlement funds are due. Those conditions include, among others, resolving claims of the insurers (either through agreement or a final court order stating that the insurers cannot maintain independent lawsuits against the defendants), legislation appropriating money from the state, and court approval of the Settlement Agreements. 
 The Settlement Agreements do not resolve claims with insurers who have asserted subrogation claims in separate lawsuits, and such insurers are not parties to the Settlement Agreements. However, the Settlement Agreements provide that all subrogation claims by insurers that have been or could be brought against defendants arising out of the Maui windstorm and wildfires must be resolved in order for HEI and Hawaiian Electric s payment obligation to arise. The Settlement Agreements include a condition to the defendants obligations providing that by May 19, 2025, either (a) insurers that have brought claims arising out of the Maui windstorm and wildfires enter into a written agreement that provides for releases of all claims against the defendants, or (b) that there is a final and unappealable court order providing that if the final definitive agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants becomes effective, then those same insurers exclusive remedy for any claims against the defendants would be limited to asserting liens against the settlement amounts obtained by the individual plaintiffs. The Supreme Court of Hawaii is currently considering three reserved questions regarding the scope of Hawaii subrogation law that may resolve the condition described in this paragraph in the manner described in (b) above. The parties briefing on these questions is expected to conclude in December 2024. No date for oral argument has been set. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, HEI and Hawaiian Electric evaluated various financing plans to pay the proposed settlement in a lump sum and determined that paying in equal annual installments is the most viable option as of September 30, 2024 and aligns with the Companies expectations of how the settlement amount will be paid. Therefore, the Utilities revised their total settlement accrual to billion, classifying the first million installment as a current liability based on expected timing of the payment and the remaining billion as a non-current liability on the Utilities Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. The Settlement Agreements contain no admission of any liability by HEI or the Utilities and reflects the collective efforts of the State, HEI and the Utilities, and other defendants to seek a comprehensive resolution of the litigation arising out of the Maui windstorm and wildfires. The Utilities have recorded an additional million in other accounts receivable, net on the Utilities Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, based on the amounts expected to be remaining under the applicate insurance policies at time of settlement payment. 
 As part of the agreement in principle preceding the Settlement Agreements, the parties agreed to vacate all trial dates and stay the litigation, except for (i) litigation activities between the plaintiffs (individual and class) and the subrogation insurers and (ii) actions taken to further settlement. On August 2, 2024, the Maui Circuit Court overseeing the Special Proceeding, in

Derivative Litigation, No. 3:23-cv-06627 (the Consolidated Derivative Actions). On June 19, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. The Consolidated Derivative Actions are purportedly brought by shareholders of HEI on behalf of nominal defendants HEI and Hawaiian Electric against certain current and former officers and directors of HEI and Hawaiian Electric. Plaintiffs purport to assert both Hawaii state law and federal securities law claims. Plaintiffs assert state law breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, unjust enrichment, gross mismanagement, and abuse of control claims purportedly arising in connection with the Maui windstorm and wildfires that occurred in August 2023 and certain public disclosures. Plaintiffs also assert claims under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and generally allege that the Company and certain of its current and former officers made materially false and misleading statements or omissions regarding the Company s wildfire prevention and safety protocols and related matters.

On July 30, 2024, upon HEI s motion, the court stayed the Hawaii Federal Derivative Actions pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the Securities Action and the motions to stay and dismiss the Consolidated Derivative Actions. While the Company has obligations to indemnify and/or advance the defendants legal fees and costs in connection with this lawsuit, any monetary recovery in the derivative litigation should accrue to the Company. The parties have agreed to mediate this case and are in the process of engaging a private mediator and scheduling a mediation session. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome and is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome. 
 Maui windstorm and wildfires costs. Legal costs in connection with the litigation and loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. The Company has million of excess liability insurance and million of miscellaneous professional liability insurance for third party claims, including claims related to wildfires, with a retention of million and million, respectively, and million directors and officers liability insurance to cover claims related to the shareholder and derivative lawsuits, with a retention of million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s and Utilities insurance receivable totaled million and million, respectively, under the policies. As of September 30, 2024, HEI and its subsidiaries have approximately million, and million of insurance coverage remaining under the excess liability, miscellaneous professional liability and directors and officers liability policies, respectively.

 On May 4, 2024, HEI and the Utilities reached an agreement to settle indemnification claims asserted by the State of Hawaii without any admission of fault or responsibility. Under the terms of the agreement, HEI and the Utilities agreed to contribute up to million through the end of 2024 related to the costs of the professional advisors engaged by the State of Hawaii to advise on a variety of matters related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires. Under certain circumstances, HEI and the Utilities have the unilateral right to terminate the agreement and stop paying the costs for future periods. As of September 30, 2024, a total of million of such costs were accrued and reflected in Maui windstorm and wildfires related expenses-Other expense in the table above. HEI and the Utilities are seeking insurance recoveries for such costs; however, the timing and amount of any insurance recoveries are not determinable at this time. 
 In addition, the Utilities incurred million and million of total capital costs related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

 The SPEs are considered VIEs due to insufficient equity investment at risk. The most significant activities that impact the economic performance of the SPEs are cash and financing management. The Utilities are considered the primary beneficiary as the Utilities direct the activities related to cash and financing management and therefore, are required to consolidate the SPEs. Although the SPEs are direct and indirect wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of the Utilities, the SPEs are legally separate from the Utilities. The assets of the SPEs (which are primarily accounts receivables) are not available to creditors of the Utilities. 
 Unconsolidated variable interest entities. 
 Power purchase agreements . As of September 30, 2024, the Utilities had power purchase agreements (PPAs) for firm capacity and other PPAs with independent power producers (IPPs) and Schedule Q providers (i.e., customers with cogeneration and/or power production facilities who buy power from or sell power to the Utilities), none of which are currently required to be consolidated as VIEs. 
 Pursuant to the current accounting standards for VIEs, the Utilities are deemed to have a variable interest in Kalaeloa Partners, L.P. (Kalaeloa) and Hamakua Energy by reason of the provisions of the PPA that the Utilities have with the IPPs. However, management has concluded that the Utilities are not the primary beneficiary of Kalaeloa and Hamakua Energy because the Utilities do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the IPPs economic performance nor the obligation to absorb their expected losses, if any, that could potentially be significant to the IPPs. Thus, the Utilities have not consolidated Kalaeloa and Hamakua Energy in its condensed consolidated financial statements. However, Hamakua Energy is an indirect subsidiary of Pacific Current and is consolidated in HEI s condensed consolidated financial statements.

 MW of renewable, dispatchable firm capacity fueled by locally grown biomass from a facility on the island of Hawaii. Under the terms of the PPA, the Hu Honua plant was scheduled to be in service in 2016. However, Hu Honua encountered construction and litigation delays, which resulted in the termination of the original PPA. Following the termination, Hu Honua filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii. The parties reached a settlement that was conditioned on the PUC s timely, non-appealable final approval of an amended and restated PPA dated May 9, 2017. On May 23, 2022, following a contested case hearing, the PUC issued a decision and order denying the amended and restated PPA, based on, among other things, findings that: (1) the project will result in significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, (2) Hu Honua s proposed carbon commitment to sequester more GHG emissions than produced by the project are speculative and unsupported, (3) the amended and restated PPA is likely to result in high costs to customers through its relatively high cost of electricity and through potential displacement of other, lower cost, renewable resources, and (4) based on the foregoing, approving the amended and restated PPA is not prudent or in the public interest. On June 2, 2022, Hawaii Electric Light and Hu Honua filed their separate motions for reconsideration, which were denied by the PUC on June 24, 2022. On June 29, 2022, Hu Honua filed its notice of appeal to the Hawaii Supreme Court of the PUC s May 23, 2022 decision and order denying the amended and restated PPA. On March 13, 2023, the Hawaii Supreme Court affirmed the PUC s decision denying the amended and restated PPA between Hu Honua and Hawaii Electric Light and entered its judgment on appeal on April 12, 2023. On June 7, 2023, Hu Honua filed a status report with the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii, stating, among other things, that because settlement of the underlying federal lawsuit was contingent on timely, non-appealable, final approval of the amended and restated PPA by the PUC, that the Hawaii Supreme Court s opinion made fulfillment of the condition impossible, and therefore the settlement agreement between the Hawaiian Electric defendants (HEI, Hawaiian Electric, and Hawaii Electric Light) and Hu Honua is null and void and of no further effect. On November 16, 2023, Hu Honua filed its Motion for Leave to File Third Amended and Supplemental Complaint and for Permissive Joinder with the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii, asking the court to grant it leave to file a Third Amended and Supplemental Complaint, which would amend its claims and add new proposed defendants. The hearing on this motion took place on February 14, 2024. The court issued a decision and order on the motion on April 2, 2024, which was consistent with Hawaii Electric Light's position, only allowing amendments that were agreed to and not allowing Hu Honua to add new claims or parties, effectively leaving Hu Honua with its previously-pled breach of contract and antitrust claims. Hu Honua filed its objection to the order on April 16, 2024 and the Hawaiian Electric defendants filed their response to the objection on April 30, 2024. A hearing on Hu Honua s objection took place on July 30, 2024. On September 12, 2024, the court issued its decision affirming the April 2, 2024 order. Hu Honua filed its Third Amended and Supplemental Complaint on October 25, 2024. 
 Molokai New Energy Partners (MNEP). In July 2018, the PUC approved Maui Electric s PPA with MNEP to purchase solar energy from a photovoltaic (PV) plus battery storage project. The MW PV and MW Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) project was to deliver no more than MW at any time to the Molokai system. On March 25, 2020, MNEP filed a complaint in the United Stated District Court for the District of Hawaii against Maui Electric claiming breach of contract. On June 3, 2020, Maui Electric provided a Notice of Default and Termination of the PPA to MNEP terminating the PPA with an effective date of July 10, 2020. Thereafter, MNEP filed an amended complaint to include claims relating to the termination and Hawaiian Electric filed its answer to the amended complaint on September 11, 2020, disputing the facts presented by MNEP and all claims within the original and amended complaint. Currently, the discovery phase is ongoing. 
 Environmental regulation. The Utilities are subject to environmental laws and regulations that regulate the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous waste and toxic substances. 
 Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, like other utilities, periodically encounter petroleum or other chemical releases associated with current or previous operations. The Utilities report and take action on these releases when and as required by applicable law and regulations. The Utilities believe the costs of responding to such releases identified to date will not have a material effect, individually or in the aggregate, on Hawaiian Electric s consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
 Former Molokai Electric Company generation site . In 1989, Maui Electric acquired Molokai Electric Company. Molokai Electric Company had sold its former generation site (Site) in 1983 but continued to operate at the Site under a lease until 1985 and left the property in 1987. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has since identified environmental impacts in the subsurface soil at the Site. In cooperation with the State of Hawaii Department of Health and EPA, Maui Electric further investigated the Site and the adjacent parcel to determine the extent of impacts of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), residual fuel oils and other subsurface contaminants. Maui Electric has a reserve balance of million as of September 30, 2024, representing the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted cost for remediation of the Site and the adjacent parcel 
 23 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Unaudited) continued 

 recorded by Hawaiian Electric to address the PCB contamination was million. The reserve balance represents the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted cost for the onshore and offshore investigation and remediation. The final remediation costs will depend on the actual onshore and offshore cleanup costs. 
 Kapolei pipeline . James Campbell Company (JCC) through its wholly owned subsidiary, Aina Nui Corporation discovered petroleum contamination in ground water during construction of a project in Kapolei in late 2022 and allegedly incurred approximately million in remediation costs. JCC made a joint demand for these costs in June 2023 and a supplemental demand in April of 2024 to two companies, including Hawaiian Electric, that have pipelines in the area of the contamination. On September 11, 2024, a settlement was reached in an amount not considered to be material. 
 Endangered Species Act (ESA) . The Utilities received a Notice under the federal Endangered Species Act, from Earthjustice on behalf of the American Bird Conservancy and Conservation Council for Hawaii (Conservation Groups) in January 2024. The Notice (Notice) is the pre-cursor to a citizen s suit under the Endangered Species Act. The Notice alleges that the Utilities are out of compliance with the Act due to alleged impacts on endangered seabirds caused by the Utilities powerlines, street lights and facility lights on Maui and Lanai. At the time the Notice was served, the Utilities were already in the process of drafting a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) with respect to the powerlines and will be applying for associated state and federal take/license permits. Notwithstanding, the Notice asserts that the scope of the HCP should be broader and additional interim measures are necessary while the HCP and related permits are pending. On October 30, 2024, the Utilities and the Conservation Groups entered into a settlement agreement, conditioned upon court approval, whereby the Utilities will continue the HCP process and take specific actions to minimize and mitigate the potential impact of the Utilities powerlines while the document is being prepared. The agreement also contains additional requirements that include coordination with the Conservation Groups with various aspects of the HCP and powerline operations, and continuing the Utilities commitment to a species mitigation project with University of Hawaii Foundation to monitor, protect and increase the population of Hawaiian Petrels. The settlement agreement will not become final until approved by the federal district court after a complaint is filed to obtain the court s jurisdiction over the agreement. After court approval, the case will be dismissed and the court will maintain jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcement of the agreement. The street and facility lights aspect of the Notice has not yet been resolved and it is expected that a second complaint will be filed in that regard that will include the County of Maui as a party. 
 Commitments . 
 Purchase commitments . In the ordinary course of business, the Utilities enter into various agreements to purchase power and lease fuel barge. As of December 31, 2023, the Utilities estimated future purchase obligations of billion. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 On March 28, 2024, AES West Oahu Solar project reached commercial operations, which has a capacity of MW with MWh batteries and total annual payment of million. On May 31, 2024, AES Kuihelani Solar project on Maui reached commercial operations, which has a capacity of MW with MWh batteries and total annual payment of million. On June 7, 2024, the Kupono Solar project on Oahu reached commercial operations, which has a capacity of MW with MWh batteries and total annual payment of million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, million of finance lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets was recorded for the battery portion of the PPAs and a total of Stage 1 and Stage 2 renewable projects provide the Utilities of MW, with MWh batteries.

 Utility projects. Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits or community support can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if it becomes probable the PUC will disallow cost recovery for all or part of a project, or if PUC-imposed caps on project costs are expected to be exceeded, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric s consolidated net income. 
 Waena Switchyard/Synchronous Condenser Project . In October 2020, to support efforts to increase renewable energy generation and reduce fossil fuel consumption by deactivating current generating units, Maui Electric filed a PUC application to construct a switchyard, which includes the extension of kV transmission lines and the relocation of another kV transmission line; and the conversion of generating units to synchronous condensers at Kahului Power Plant in central Maui. In November 2021, the PUC approved Maui Electric s request to commit funds estimated at million for the project, and to recover capital expenditures for the project under Exceptional Project Recovery Mechanism (EPRM) not to exceed million, which shall be further reduced to reflect the total project cost exclusive of overhead costs not directly attributable to the project. The Waena Switchyard was placed in service on October 25, 2023. Maui Electric petitioned and received from the State of Hawaii Department of Health a one-year extension to the mandatory retirement of Kahului Power Plant and there is now flexibility to operate the units until the end of 2028. The conversion of the generating units will be performed after the retirement of Kahului Power Plant Units 3 and 4. 
 In approving the project, the PUC recognized that the project will facilitate the ability to accommodate increased renewable energy, as contemplated under the EPRM guidelines. As of September 30, 2024, million has been incurred for the project. 
 Waena Battery Energy Storage System Project . In September 2020, Maui Electric filed a PUC application to purchase and install a MW BESS at its Waena Site in Central Maui. In December 2023, the PUC approved Maui Electric s request to commit funds estimated at million, for the purchase and installation of the project, and to recover costs for the project under EPRM. Project costs incurred as of September 30, 2024 amount to million. 
 Climate Adaptation Transmission and Distribution Resilience Program . The Utilities maintain that improving resiliency of the electric grid is an urgent matter and recognizes that climate change is making Hawaii increasingly vulnerable to sever weather events. On January 31, 2024, the PUC approved the Utilities request to commit an estimated million in funds for the Climate Adaptation Transmission and Distribution Resilience Program, over a project period of . The project is to focus on, among other things, system hardening in wildfire risk areas to prevent ignition and to enable quicker response, video camera and weather monitors in wildfire risk areas and to add situational awareness, and strengthening transmission lines. 
 The project costs to be recovered through EPRM is subject to a cap of million and any amount in excess will be subject to the PUC s further review. On August 7, 2024, the Utilities received a notification from the U.S. Department of Energy that its application for million in federal funds under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) has been awarded. On August 20, 2024, the Utilities submitted a copy of their executed agreement with the Department of Energy to the PUC. Project costs incurred as of September 30, 2024 amount to million.

 PIMs, a SSM, and extended the timeframe for an existing PIM. Specifically, the PUC approved (1) a (penalty-only) generation-caused interruption reliability PIM, (2) a (penalty/reward) interconnection requirements study PIM, (3) a (reward-only) Collective Shared Savings Mechanism (CSSM), and (4) a modification and extension of the existing Interim Grid Services PIM (reward-only). On November 23, 2022, the PUC approved the Utilities proposed tariffs to implement the aforementioned PIMs with an effective date of January 1, 2023. 
 In addition, the June 2022 D O instructed the Utilities to prepare and submit: a detailed fossil fuel retirement report (FF Retirement Report) outlining necessary steps to safely and reliably retire certain existing fossil fuel power plants during the first multi-year rate period (MRP); and a functional integration plan (FIP) for distributed energy resources (DER) to increase transparency into the Utilities plans and progress for utilizing cost-effective grid services from DERs and ensure that the necessary functionalities and requisite technologies are in place to do so. The PUC also instructed the PBR Working Group to continue its ongoing collaborative efforts to consider other potential new incentive mechanisms and to address other issues raised during the proceeding. On March 30, 2023, the PUC held a PBR Working Group coordination meeting to initiate subgroups on the Long-Term Grid Services PIM, modification/evaluation of existing PIMs, and comprehensive PBR Framework review priority topics. 
 In accordance with the June 2022 D O, the Utilities filed their FIP on September 30, 2022, Long-Term Grid Services PIM proposal on July 3, 2023, and FF Retirement Report on October 11, 2024. 
 On October 16, 2023, the Utilities filed a request for limited suspension of the Transmission and Distribution (T D) System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) PIM, the T D System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) PIM, and the target heat rate provision of Maui Electric Maui Division s Energy Cost Recovery Clause (ECRC) tariff starting from August 8, 2023. On December 28, 2023, the PUC issued an order granting a temporary suspension of Maui Electric s T D SAIDI and SAIFI PIMs and Maui Electric Maui Division s target heat rate provision from August 8, 2023 through June 30, 2024, which the tariffs became effective on January 1, 2024. 
 On November 3, 2023, the Utilities, Ulupono Initiative LLC, and the County of Hawaii filed a stipulation on proposed modifications to the RPS-A, Call Center, AMI Utilization, and interconnection requirements study PIMs. On June 24, 2024, the PUC issued an order (1) approving modifications to the interconnection requirements study PIM to expand its application to firm generation projects effective August 1, 2024, (2) approving a consolidated target for the Call Center PIM and modifying the target performance based on the average of the Utilities performance, weighted by the number of calls for the last eight quarters as of December 31, 2023, to be effective August 1, 2024, (3) denying the proposed modifications to the RPS-A PIM and clarifying that it will continue to operate according to its existing tariff language; and (4) denying the proposed

 MRP during which there will be no general rate cases. Target revenues will be adjusted according to an index-driven ARA based on (i) an inflation factor, (ii) a predetermined X-factor to encompass productivity, which is set at zero, (iii) a Z-factor to account for exceptional circumstances not in the Utilities control and (iv) a customer dividend consisting of a negative adjustment of of adjusted revenue requirements compounded annually and a flow through of the pre-PBR savings commitment from the management audit recommendations developed in a prior docket at a rate of million per year from 2021 to 2025. The ARA mechanism replaced the previous revenue adjustment mechanism (RAM). RAM revenue adjustments approved by the PUC in 2020 will continue to be included in the RBA provision s target revenue and RBA rate adjustment to the extent such adjustments are not included in base rate unless modified with PUC approval. The implementation of the ARA occurred on June 1, 2021. 
 Earnings sharing mechanism . The PBR Framework established a symmetrical ESM for achieved rate-making ROACE outside of a basis points deadband above or below the current authorized ROACE of for each of the Utilities. There is a /50 sharing between customers and Utilities for the achieved rate-making ROACE falling within basis points outside of the deadband in either direction, and a /10 sharing for any further difference. A reopening or review of the PBR terms may be triggered if the Utilities credit rating outlook indicates a potential credit downgrade below investment grade status, or if its achieved rate-making ROACE enters the outer most tier of the ESM. 
 On August 31, 2023, the PUC issued an order temporarily suspending the ESM until further notice. The intent of the order is to address the unintended consequence of customers potentially bearing the costs associated with the Maui windstorm and wildfires through the operation of the ESM without prior PUC review. 
 Exceptional project recovery mechanism . Prior to the implementation of the PBR Framework, the PUC established the Major Project Interim Recovery (MPIR) adjustment mechanism and MPIR Guidelines. The MPIR mechanism provides the opportunity to recover revenues for net costs of approved eligible projects placed in service between general rate cases. In establishing the PBR Framework, the MPIR Guidelines were terminated and replaced with the EPRM Guidelines. Although the MPIR Guidelines were terminated and replaced by the EPRM Guidelines, the MPIR mechanism will continue within the PBR Framework to provide recovery of project costs previously approved for recovery under the MPIR. The established EPRM

 million, including revenue taxes, for the Schofield Generating Station million), West Loch PV project million), Grid Modernization Strategy (GMS) Phase 1 project million for all three utilities), Waiawa UFLS project million) and Waena Switchyard/Synchronous project million) that included the 2024 return on project amount (based on approved amounts) in rate base, depreciation and incremental O M expenses. The PUC approved the Utilities recovery of the annualized 2024 MPIR and EPRM amounts for the Schofield Generating Station, West Loch PV, GMS Phase 1, Waiawa UFLS and Waena Switchyard projects effective June 1, 2024 through the RBA rate adjustment. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the PUC approved EPRM applications for projects totaling million to the extent the project costs are not included in rates. Currently, the Utilities are seeking EPRM recovery for additional projects with total project costs up to million, subject to PUC approval. 
 Pilot process . As part of the PBR Framework, the PUC approved a pilot process to foster innovation by establishing an expedited implementation process for pilots that tests new technologies, programs, business models, and other arrangements (Pilot Process). Under the Pilot Process, the Utilities submit specific pilot proposals (Pilot Notices) that are within the scope of the approved Workplan to the PUC for their expedited review. The PUC will strive to issue an order addressing a proposed pilot within days of the filing date of a Pilot Notice. If the PUC does not take affirmative action on a Pilot Notice by the end of the -day period, the Pilot Notice will be considered approved as submitted. The PUC may modify the pilot as originally proposed, and the Utilities will have days to notify the PUC whether the Utilities accept the modification, propose further modification, or withdraw the Pilot Notice. The PUC may also, where necessary, suspend the Pilot Notice for further investigation. 
 The approved Pilot Process includes a cost recovery process that generally allows the Utilities to defer and recover total annual expenditures of approved pilot projects net of revenues, subject to an annual cap of million, over 12 months beginning June 1 of the year following pilot implementation through the RBA rate adjustment, although the PUC may determine on a case-by-case basis that a particular project s deferred costs should be amortized over a period greater than 12 months. 
 On March 11, 2024, the Utilities filed their annual Pilot Update report covering pilot projects that were active during 2023, including reporting on pilot projects that were initiated prior to the commencement of the Pilot Process. The Pilot Update reported on approximately million of 2023 recorded pilot project costs including revenue taxes for the Utilities. The 2023 recorded pilot project costs were included in the Utilities proposed adjustments to target revenue in the 2024 spring revenue report filed on March 28, 2024. 
 Performance incentive mechanisms . The following PIMs and SSMs were approved by the PUC and are applicable for the 2023 evaluation period and through September 30, 2024. 
 Service Quality performance incentives (ongoing). Service Quality performance incentives are measured on a calendar-year basis. The PIM tariff requires the performance targets, deadbands and the amount of maximum financial incentives used to determine the PIM financial incentive levels for each of the PIMs to remain constant in interim periods, unless otherwise amended by order of the PUC. 
 Service Reliability Performance measured by Transmission and Distribution-caused SAIDI and SAIFI (penalties only). Target performance is based on each utility s historical average performance with a deadband of one standard deviation. The maximum penalty for each performance index is basis points applied to the common equity share of each respective utility s approved rate base (or maximum penalties of approximately million for calendar year 2023 - for both indices in total for the three utilities). On December 28, 2023, the PUC issued an order granting a temporary suspension of Maui Electric s T D SAIDI and SAIFI PIMs from August 8, 2023 through June 30, 2024. On April 1, 2024, the Utilities filed a request for partial temporary suspension and modification of the T D SAIDI and SAIFI PIMs, specifically requesting to suspend the T D SAIDI and SAIFI PIMs for wildfire risk circuits from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2025 and proposed that circuits not identified as wildfire risk circuits continue to be subject to the existing PIMs on a prorated basis and measured effective January 1, 2024. The Utilities are requesting a D O by December 16, 2024. For the 2023 evaluation period, the Utilities incurred million in penalties. 
 28 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Unaudited) continued 

 above and below the target. On June 24, 2024, the PUC issued an order approving a consolidated target for the Call Center PIM and modifying the target performance based on the average of the Utilities performance, weighted by the number of calls for the last eight quarters as of December 31, 2023, to be effective August 1, 2024. The maximum penalty or reward is basis points applied to the common equity share of each respective utility s approved rate base (or maximum penalties or rewards of approximately million - in total for the three utilities). 
 Phase 1 RFP PIM. Procurement of low-cost variable renewable resources through the RFP process in 2018 is measured by comparison of the procurement price to target prices. The first portion of the incentive was earned upon PUC approval of the PPAs. Based on the PPAs approved in 2019, the Utilities recognized million in 2019 with the remaining award to be recognized in the year following the in-service date of the projects prorated in proportion to the actual amount of energy utilized, which is estimated to occur from 2023 to 2025. Based on the in-service date of projects, the Utilities earned the second portion of the incentive of approximately million (for Hawaiian Electric) in rewards in both 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. In the second quarter of 2024, the Utilities accrued the second portion of the incentive of approximately million (for Hawaii Electric Light). 
 Renewable portfolio standard (RPS) - A PIM that provides a financial reward for accelerating the achievement of RPS goals. The Utilities may earn a reward for the amount of system generation above the interpolated statutory RPS goal at /MWh in 2021 and 2022, /MWh in 2023, and /MWh for the remainder of the MRP. Penalties are already prescribed in the RPS as /MWh for failing to meet RPS targets in 2030, 2040 and 2045. The evaluation period commenced on January 1, 2021. In 2023, the Utilities earned million in rewards. 
 Interim Grid Services - An interim PIM that provided financial rewards on a /kW basis for the acquisition of eligible grid services through procurement or programs acquired between January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023. Eligible grid services included fast frequency response, load build, and/or load reduction services intended to be utilized in system operation. In 2023, the Utilities earned million in rewards. The PUC intends to replace the Interim Grid Services PIM with a Long-Term PIM that incents DER grid service utilization with review and development of the Long-Term DER Utilization PIM to continue through the PBR Framework review process.

Regulatory assets and liabilities . 
 Regulatory asset related to retirement of Honolulu generating units 8 and 9. On December 22, 2023, the PUC issued a decision and order approving the Utilities request to establish a regulatory asset for the remaining net book value of the fossil fuel generating units for both Honolulu units 8 and 9 assets that retired on December 31, 2023, and amortize the regulatory asset over approximately . The PUC also ruled that the Utilities may seek to include the regulatory asset in rate base and seek to recover the amortization expense and a return on the unamortized balance of the regulatory asset in the next rate case or rate re-setting proceeding. As of September 30, 2024, the Utilities have recorded million in regulatory assets for the remaining net book value of Honolulu generating units 8 and 9. 
 Regulatory assets for Maui windstorm and wildfires related costs. On December 27, 2023, the PUC issued an order authorizing deferred accounting treatment for the Utilities incremental non-labor expenses under specific cost categories related to the August 2023 Maui windstorm and wildfires. The deferred accounting treatment applies to certain non-labor expenses incurred from August 8, 2023 through December 31, 2024 that are not already a part of base rates. The approval pertains to deferred cost treatment. The requests for cost recovery of deferred costs will be the subject of a separate application at which time the PUC will evaluate whether such costs were prudently incurred and reasonable and determine the extent to which such costs will be eligible for recovery, and the period over which recovery will occur. If the PUC denies recovery of any deferred costs, such costs would be charged to expense in the period that those costs are no longer considered probable of recovery. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Utilities have recorded million in regulatory assets for the incremental costs incurred related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires event.

 In February 2019, the PUC approved a methodology for passing the future cost saving benefits of the ERP/EAM system to customers developed by the Utilities in collaboration with the Consumer Advocate. The Utilities filed a benefits clarification document on June 10, 2019, reflecting million in future net other operation and maintenance (O M) expense reductions and cost avoidance, and million in capital cost reductions and tax savings over the -year service life. To the extent the reduction in O M expense relates to amounts reflected in electric rates, the Utilities would reduce future rates for such amounts. In October 2019, the PUC approved the Utilities and the Consumer Advocate s Stipulated Performance Metrics and Tracking Mechanism. As part of the settlement agreement approved in the Hawaiian Electric 2020 test year rate case, the regulatory liability for Hawaiian Electric will be amortized over , beginning in November 2020, and the O M benefits for Hawaiian Electric was considered flowed through to customers. On December 29, 2023, the PUC approved the Utilities proposal to accelerate flow-through of the ERP benefits savings currently tracked in regulatory liability accounts to Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric customers as part of the customer dividend in the ARA, to mitigate the impact of the Utilities recovery of the COVID-19 related costs on customers. See Regulatory assets for COVID-19 related costs section below. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Utilities regulatory liability was million million for Hawaiian Electric, million for Hawaii Electric Light and million for Maui Electric) for the O M expense savings that are being amortized or to be included in future rates. At the PUC s direction, the Utilities have been filing Annual Enterprise System Benefits (AESB) report on the achieved benefits savings. The most recent AESB report was filed on February 13, 2024 for the period January 1 through December 31, 2023. 
 Regulatory assets for COVID-19 related costs. On December 29, 2023, the PUC issued a decision and order (December 2023 D O) approving the Utilities request to recover the COVID-19 related deferred costs up to million evenly over a recovery period from 2024 through 2026 through the Z-factor in the ARA. Following the Utilities motion for clarification or in the alternative partial reconsideration of the December 2023 D O, on February 27, 2024, the PUC issued an order clarifying the December 2023 D O and approving, among other things, the Utilities requests to base the recovery on the recorded balances as of December 31, 2023 and to modify the recovery period to begin June 1, 2024 and end May 31, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, the Utilities have recorded million in regulatory assets for deferral of COVID-19 related costs. 
 Regulatory assets for suspension of disconnections related costs. Based on circumstances related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires, on August 31, 2023 and subsequently on October 13, 2023, the PUC issued orders directing all regulated utilities located on, or providing utility service on Maui, including the Utilities, among other things, (i) to suspend disconnections of services and associated disconnection fees beginning from August 8, 2023, through the end of the emergency relief period established by the Governor s Emergency Proclamations related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires, which currently continues through December 7, 2024 (Suspension Period); (ii) to suspend any and all rules and provisions of individual utility tariffs that prevent or condition re-connection of disconnected customers during the Suspension Period; (iii) not to charge customers interest on past due payments or impose any late payment fees through the Suspension Period; (iv) to establish regulatory assets to record costs directly related to the suspension of disconnections, and to record receipt of governmental aid and donation-based aid, loans or grants, and/or all other assistance measures, and any cost savings realized; and (v) to file a notice with the PUC regarding any upcoming application or other request pursuant to HRS Sections 269-16.3, -17, -17.5, -18, -19, or -19.5 and/or regarding any significant financial change to the Maui utility, at least 60 days prior to filing such application or other request with the PUC. The orders also discourage the filing of emergency or general rate increases in response to the emergency situation. In future proceedings, the PUC will assess the utility s request for recovery of these regulatory assets including whether it is reasonable and necessary, the appropriate period of recovery for the approved amount of regulatory assets, any amount of carrying costs thereon, any savings directly attributable to suspension of disconnects, and other related matters. As of September 30, 2024, the Utilities have recorded million in regulatory assets for the incremental costs incurred due to the suspension of disconnections.

 Goodwill. Goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. The Company has identified ASB as a reporting unit and ASB s goodwill relates to past acquisitions and is ASB s only intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. The Company performs assessments of the carrying value of its goodwill at least annually and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of these events and circumstances include a significant change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, competition, loss of key personnel, a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of, and other factors. 
 HEI and ASB have been undertaking a comprehensive review of strategic options for ASB. During the course of this process, HEI and ASB had determined it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of ASB is less than its carrying value. In light of this, as part of its on-going goodwill evaluation and the change in circumstances, after performing the goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2024, HEI and ASB determined the full amount of its goodwill was impaired. As a result of the June 30, 2024 impairment test ASB recorded a pretax goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter 2024. The impairment charge is recorded in Total Noninterest Expense in ASB s Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income Data, and recorded in Bank Expenses in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The impairment charge was non-cash in nature and did not affect the Company s current liquidity, cash flows or any debt covenants under the Company s existing credit agreements.

 ASB does not believe that the investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, represent a credit loss. Total gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to change in market conditions. On a quarterly basis the investment securities are evaluated for changes in financial condition of the issuer. Based upon ASB s evaluation, all securities held within the investment portfolio continue to be rated investment grade by one or more agencies. The contractual cash flows of the U.S. Treasury, federal agency obligations and agency mortgage-backed securities are backed by the full faith and credit guaranty of the United States government, an agency of the government or a government-sponsored entity. ASB does not intend to sell the securities before the recovery of its amortized cost basis and there have been no adverse changes in the timing of the contractual cash flows for the securities. ASB s investment securities portfolio did not require an allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 U.S. Treasury, federal agency obligations, corporate bonds, and mortgage revenue bonds have contractual terms to maturity. Mortgage-backed securities have contractual terms to maturity, but require periodic payments to reduce principal.

 Credit quality . ASB performs an internal loan review and grading on an ongoing basis. The review provides management with periodic information as to the quality of the loan portfolio and effectiveness of its lending policies and procedures. The objectives of the loan review and grading procedures are to identify, in a timely manner, existing or emerging credit trends so that appropriate steps can be initiated to manage risk and avoid or minimize future losses. Loans subject to grading include commercial, commercial real estate and commercial construction loans. 
 Each commercial and commercial real estate loan is assigned an Asset Quality Rating (AQR) reflecting the likelihood of repayment or orderly liquidation of that loan transaction pursuant to regulatory credit classifications: Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss. The AQR is a function of the probability of default model rating, the loss given default, and possible non-model factors which impact the ultimate collectability of the loan such as character of the business owner/guarantor, interim period performance, litigation, tax liens and major changes in business and economic conditions. Pass exposures generally are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the value of the asset or underlying collateral. Special Mention loans have potential weaknesses that, if left uncorrected, could jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Substandard loans have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that ASB may sustain some loss. An asset classified Doubtful has the weaknesses of those classified Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. An asset classified Loss is considered uncollectible and has such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted.

 ASB did not recognize interest on nonaccrual loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Modifications Made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty. The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon origination. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loan information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. ASB uses a probability of default/loss given default model to determine the allowance for credit losses. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made at the time of the modification. 
 Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. 
 Modifications may include interest rate reductions, interest only payments for an extended period of time, protracted terms such as amortization and maturity beyond the customary length of time found in the normal marketplace, and other actions intended to minimize economic loss and to provide alternatives to foreclosure or repossession of collateral.

 ASB had million and million of consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that were in the process of foreclosure at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) . In its mortgage banking business, ASB sells residential mortgage loans to government-sponsored entities and other parties, who may issue securities backed by pools of such loans. ASB retains no beneficial interests in these loans other than the servicing rights of certain loans sold. 
 ASB received proceeds from the sale of residential mortgages of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and recognized gains on such sales of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 The effect of a variation in certain assumptions on fair value is calculated without changing any other assumptions. This analysis typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of a change in one key assumption to the changes in the fair value of MSRs typically is not linear. 
 
 Other borrowings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ASB had million and million of FHLB advances outstanding, respectively, and borrowings with the Federal Reserve Bank of and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, ASB was in compliance with all FHLB Advances, Pledge and Security Agreement requirements and all requirements to borrow at the Federal Reserve Discount Window Primary Credit Facility under 12 CFR 201.4(a) guidelines. 
 Derivative financial instruments. ASB enters into interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) with borrowers, and forward commitments to sell loans or to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities to investors to hedge against the inherent interest rate and pricing risks associated with selling loans. 
 ASB enters into IRLCs for residential mortgage loans, which commit ASB to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specific interest rate and within a specified period of time. IRLCs that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale are considered derivative financial instruments under applicable accounting guidance. Outstanding IRLCs expose ASB to the risk that the price of the mortgage loans underlying the commitments may decline due to increases in mortgage interest rates from inception of the rate lock to the funding of the loan. The IRLCs are free-standing derivatives which are carried at fair value with changes recorded in mortgage banking income. 
 ASB enters into forward commitments to hedge the interest rate risk for rate locked mortgage applications in process and closed mortgage loans held for sale. These commitments are primarily forward sales of to-be-announced mortgage backed securities. Generally, when mortgage loans are closed, the forward commitment is liquidated and replaced with a mandatory delivery forward sale of the mortgage to a secondary market investor. In some cases, a best-efforts forward sale agreement is utilized as the forward commitment. These commitments are free-standing derivatives which are carried at fair value with changes recorded in mortgage banking income. 
 Changes in the fair value of IRLCs and forward commitments subsequent to inception are based on changes in the fair value of the underlying loan resulting from the fulfillment of the commitment and changes in the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the commitment, which is affected primarily by changes in interest rates and the passage of time.

The million HEI Facility s initial termination date was May 14, 2026. The million Hawaiian Electric Facility s initial termination date was May 13, 2022, but on February 18, 2022, the PUC approved Hawaiian Electric s request to extend the term of the million Hawaiian Electric Facility to May 14, 2026. In addition to extending the term, Hawaiian Electric also received PUC approval to exercise its options of extensions of the commitment termination date and to increase its aggregate revolving commitment amount from million to million, should there be a need. 
 On April 21, 2023, HEI and Hawaiian Electric executed Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Facilities (Amendment). The Amendment was executed to reflect the transition from the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate to the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the benchmark interest rate for non-Alternate Base Rate (ABR) Loans under the Credit Facilities. 
 On May 14, 2023, HEI and Hawaiian Electric exercised their first of , extensions to the commitment termination date with of the financial institutions to extend the Credit Facilities to May 14, 2027. The committed capacities under the HEI Facility and Hawaiian Electric Facility are million and million, respectively, through May 14, 2026, and step down to approximately million and million, respectively, through May 14, 2027. 
 In August 2023, HEI and Hawaiian Electric drew the full committed capacity on their respective existing revolving credit facilities, totaling million and million, respectively. The draws were made to provide access to liquidity and support the Company s restoration efforts on Maui. The cash proceeds were primarily invested in highly liquid short-term investments and used for general corporate purposes.

 Asset-backed lending facility credit agreement . On May 17, 2024, Hawaiian Electric, through a special-purpose subsidiary, entered into an asset-based lending facility (ABL Facility) credit agreement (ABL Credit Facility Agreement) with several banks, which, subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in such agreement, including approval by the PUC, allows borrowings of up to million on a revolving basis using certain accounts receivable as collateral. Hawaiian Electric filed an application with the PUC for approval to (i) sell accounts receivable, and (ii) establish a long-term credit facility. The first approval would allow the ABL Credit Facility Agreement to become effective for days and the second approval would extend the term of the ABL Credit Facility Agreement from days to . The ABL Credit Facility Agreement has an initial term of days, with an automatic extension to upon receipt of the second PUC approval, with separate options to extend one additional year, subject to the consent of the lenders. Hawaiian Electric received the first and second approvals from the PUC for the ABL Credit Facility Agreement that allows short-term and long-term borrowings of up to million on June 27, 2024 and October 11, 2024, respectively, subject to the availability of a sufficient borrowing base of eligible receivables. The ABL Facility became effective on July 24, 2024. The ABL Facility remains undrawn as of September 30, 2024; however, the amount that could be drawn is temporarily limited due to the accrual of the wildfire tort-related claims, which reduces the amount of additional debt that could be incurred before exceeding certain financial covenants. The amount that could be drawn as of September 30, 2024 was approximately million and will increase over time as earnings are generated and when HEI contributes equity related to the settlement payments or for capital expenditures. 
 Changes in debt. As of September 30, 2024, the Company and Hawaiian Electric were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants. 
 Mahipapa non-recourse loan . In March 2024, a fire destroyed the cooling tower at the Mahipapa facility on Kauai. The fire was ignited from a vendor s welding activities being performed on the cooling tower during its scheduled maintenance. The plant is currently shut down while repairs are being performed. As a result, on June 26, 2024, the lender granted Mahipapa a deferral of scheduled (July 2024 and September 2024) principal and interest payments totaling million. The deferred payments will be repaid in quarterly payments commencing in March 2025. Mahipapa will re-commence debt payments in December 2024.

 Long-term incentive plan payable in stock. The 2022-24, 2023-25 and 2024-26 long-term incentive plans (LTIP) provide for performance awards under the EIP of shares of HEI common stock based on the satisfaction of performance goals, including a market condition goal. The number of shares of HEI common stock that may be awarded is fixed on the date the grants are made, subject to the achievement of specified performance levels and calculated dividend equivalents. The potential payout varies from to of the number of target shares, depending on the achievement of the goals. The market condition goal is based on HEI s total shareholder return (TSR) compared to the Peer Group (Edison Electric Institute Index (EEI Index) for the 2022-24 performance period, and compared to the Company's compensation peer group consisting of companies in the EEI Index and approved by the Company's Compensation and Human Capital Management Committee for the 2023-25 and 2024-26 performance periods), in each case over the relevant period.

In May 2024, the IRS proposed a disallowance of million from the million of additional R D tax credits claimed for the 2016 to 2018 tax years. The Company accepted the proposed adjustment in September 2024 which resulted in an additional million of 2016-2018 R D tax credits and release of the related previously recorded uncertain tax position reserve. Total additional tax benefit recognized in September 2024 was million. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed by President Biden on August 16, 2022. Key provisions under the IRA include a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) imposed on certain large corporations and a 1 excise tax on stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. Based on current interpretation of the law and current guidance available, the Company does not believe HEI will be impacted by the CAMT or stock repurchase excise tax provisions. 
 The IRA also creates new tax credits and enhances others to stimulate investment in renewable energy sources. Certain provisions of the IRA became effective in tax year 2023. The Company is exploring clean energy tax incentives included in the IRA.

 Mortgage revenue bonds are issued by the Department of Budget and Finance of the State of Hawaii. The Company estimates the fair value by using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of estimated future principal and interest payments. The unobservable input used in the fair value measurement is the weighted average discount rate. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average discount rate was , which was derived by incorporating a credit spread over the one month SOFR. Significant increases (decreases) in the weighted average discount rate could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 
 Fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables above. These measurements primarily result from assets carried at the lower of cost or fair value or from impairment of individual assets.

 HEI consolidated 
 Recent developments. On August 8, 2023, a number of brush fires in the West Maui (Lahaina) and Upcountry Maui areas caused widespread property damage, including damage to property of the Utilities, and 102 confirmed fatalities in Lahaina (the Maui windstorm and wildfires). 
 As of November 4, 2024, HEI and the Utilities have each been named in approximately 750 lawsuits related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires. These civil and class action lawsuits are pending in the Maui Circuit Court against HEI, the Utilities, and other defendants, including the County of Maui, the State of Hawaii and related state entities, private landowners and developers, and telecommunications companies (collectively, tort-related legal claims). One class action is also pending in federal court. Most of these lawsuits allege that the defendants were responsible for, and/or negligent in failing to prevent or respond to the wildfires that led to the property destruction and loss of life. Other claims include, among other things, personal injury, wrongful death, emotional distress and inverse condemnation. One lawsuit asserting similar theories and claims was filed by the County of Maui against HEI and the Utilities, one lawsuit was filed by Spectrum Oceanic, LLC against HEI and the Utilities and other defendants, and other lawsuits were filed by approximately 160 subrogation insurers against HEI, the Utilities, a private landowner, and telecommunications companies. Additional lawsuits may be filed against the Company and other defendants in the future. The plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, including punitive damages. Defendants have asserted cross-claims against one another for indemnification, contribution, and subrogation. In addition to the tort-related legal claims, the Company is also involved in a securities class action and six shareholder lawsuits. See Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Effective November 1, 2024, HEI and Hawaiian Electric entered into two definitive settlement agreements (collectively, the Settlement Agreements) to settle the tort-related legal claims in the litigation arising out of the Maui windstorm and wildfires (expressly excluding securities and derivative actions) on a global basis without any admission of liability. Under the Settlement Agreements, subject to certain conditions (including those described below), HEI and Hawaiian Electric, along with other defendants (the State of Hawaii, the County of Maui, Kamehameha Schools, entities affiliated with the West Maui Land Co., Hawaiian Telcom, and Spectrum/Charter Communications) have agreed to settle the claims of those who filed lawsuits in state and federal courts, or who may have claims but have not yet filed lawsuits, in connection with the Maui windstorm and wildfires. One Settlement Agreement is between the defendants, class counsel, and class plaintiffs (the Class Settlement Agreement), and the other is between the defendants and over 30 lawyers representing numerous individual plaintiffs who have brought their own lawsuits (the Individual Settlement Agreement). The Settlement Agreements do not resolve claims with insurers who have asserted or could assert subrogation claims in separate lawsuits and such insurers are not parties to the Settlement Agreements, but resolving such claims in the manner set forth in the Settlement Agreements (described below) is a condition that must be satisfied before any payment is due from the defendants. Both Settlement Agreements remain subject to court approval and other conditions, including those set out below. 
 Under the Settlement Agreements, HEI and Hawaiian Electric are obligated to contribute a total of 1.99 billion (out of a total defendant contribution of approximately 4.04 billion), which includes 75 million previously contributed for the One Ohana Initiative , which is to be divided between two settlement funds, one for the benefit of individual plaintiffs, and the other for the benefit of the class plaintiffs. HEI and Hawaiian Electric must pay such amounts in four equal annual installments of 479 million, with the first installment expected to be made in late 2025. HEI and Hawaiian Electric have the option to accelerate the payments, in whole or in part, with such accelerated payments to be discounted at a rate of 5.5 per annum. HEI has agreed to transfer the amount of the first payment, 479 million, into a new subsidiary, which is restricted from disbursing such funds except in connection with the initial payments to the settlement funds. Additionally, under the Settlement Agreements, HEI and Hawaiian Electric are obligated to contribute a share to the settlement administration fees only if certain other sources are exhausted when those fees are due, for which, 3.5 million was accrued as of September 30, 2024 based on the best estimate at this time. 
 The Settlement Agreements are intended to resolve all of the tort-related legal claims related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires. The Class Settlement Agreement provides releases by plaintiffs to the defendants, and among defendants, for acts and omissions relating to the Maui windstorm and wildfires. The Individual Settlement Agreement provides that individual plaintiffs who elect to accept the settlement will sign releases. The releases in the Settlement Agreements, including those among defendants (subject to certain conditions), are effective on the initial payment due date. The Settlement Agreements also 
 72 

provide that 500 million of the total settlement payments will be reserved and made available to defendants to defray the cost to resolve any claims brought by nonparticipating plaintiffs. Defendants have the right to terminate the Settlement Agreements under certain circumstances, including if more than specified thresholds of plaintiffs choose not to participate in the settlement. 
 The Settlement Agreements contain multiple conditions that must be met before any payment from HEI and Hawaiian Electric to the settlement funds are due. Those conditions include, among others, resolving claims of the insurers (either through agreement or a final court order stating that the insurers cannot maintain independent lawsuits against the defendants), legislation appropriating money from the state, and court approval of the Settlement Agreements. 
 The Settlement Agreements do not resolve claims with insurers who have asserted subrogation claims in separate lawsuits, and such insurers are not parties to the Settlement Agreements. However, the Settlement Agreements provide that all subrogation claims by insurers that have been or could be brought against defendants arising out of the Maui windstorm and wildfires must be resolved in order for HEI and Hawaiian Electric s payment obligation to arise. The Settlement Agreements include a condition to the defendants obligations providing that by May 19, 2025, either (a) insurers that have brought claims arising out of the Maui windstorm and wildfires enter into a written agreement that provides for releases of all claims against the defendants, or (b) that there is a final and unappealable court order providing that if the final definitive agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants becomes effective, then those same insurers exclusive remedy for any claims against the defendants would be limited to asserting liens against the settlement amounts obtained by the individual plaintiffs. The Supreme Court of Hawaii is currently considering three reserved questions regarding the scope of Hawaii subrogation law that may resolve the condition described in this paragraph in the manner described in (b) above. The parties briefing on these questions is expected to conclude in December 2024. No date for oral argument has been set. 
 The foregoing descriptions of the Settlement Agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Settlement Agreements attached as exhibits to the Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC on November 5, 2024. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, HEI and Hawaiian Electric evaluated various financing plans to pay the proposed settlement in a lump sum and determined that paying in four equal annual installments is the most viable option as of September 30, 2024 and aligns with the Companies expectations of how the settlement amount will be paid. Therefore, the Utilities revised their total settlement accrual to 1.92 billion, classifying the first 479 million installment as a current liability based on expected timing of the payment and the remaining 1.44 billion as a non-current liability on the Utilities Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. The Settlement Agreements contain no admission of any liability by HEI or the Utilities and reflects the collective efforts of the State, HEI and the Utilities, and other defendants to seek a comprehensive resolution of the litigation arising out of the Maui windstorm and wildfires. The Utilities have recorded an additional 40 million in other accounts receivable, net on the Utilities Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, based on the amounts expected to be remaining under the applicate insurance policies at time of settlement payment. 
 In an effort to finance the first settlement payment, on September 25, 2024, HEI completed the sale of 62.2 million shares of common stock. The shares were issued under a registration statement registering up to 575 million of common stock. The net proceeds from the sale of common stock amounted to approximately 557.7 million. In addition, on September 19, 2024, HEI filed with the SEC an at-the-market (ATM) offering program under which HEI may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, its common stock, without par value, having an aggregate offering price of up to 250 million. To date, HEI has not sold any common stock under this program. HEI is working with its financial advisors on additional financing plans to raise capital necessary to fund the remaining settlement amount. 
 On April 16, 2024, the County of Maui Department of Fire and Public Safety (MFD) released its After-Action Report (AAR) on the Maui windstorm and wildfires, the purpose of which was to enable future enhancements to mitigate the impact of future similar major events. The AAR identified 17 issues that the MFD faced during the Maui windstorm and wildfires or needs to address and provided 111 recommendations to consider for addressing these challenges. The issues and recommendations focus on the MFD. Some of the key areas for improvement include addressing the lack of apparatus, personnel and fire stations and the need for mutual aid and communication programs. The AAR did not address the cause or origin of the fires. 
 On April 17, 2024, the Hawaii Attorney General released the first of three reports that it plans on releasing regarding its investigation into the Maui windstorm and wildfires (the first AG report). The first AG report chronologically details the major events and response efforts related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires, with a focus on the events concerning the Lahaina area between 2:55 p.m. on August 8, 2023, and 8:30 a.m. on August 9, 2023. It did not address the cause or origin of the fires. 
 On September 13, 2024, the Hawaii Attorney General released the second of three reports, concerning the timeline and facts of the Maui windstorm and wildfires (the second AG report). The second AG report focused on the events that occurred prior to, during, and immediately following the fire in Lahaina in the afternoon of August 8, 2023, including preparedness 
 73 

efforts, weather and its impact to infrastructure, and other fires occurring on Maui. It did not address the cause or origin of the fires. The third planned report is expected to provide recommendations to address future events. 
 On October 2, 2024, the MFD released its Origin and Cause Report on the fires in Lahaina on August 8, 2023, incorporating the investigative report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The MFD/ATF reports conclude that the afternoon Lahaina fire on August 8, 2023 was a rekindle of the morning fire, and that the morning fire was caused by a damaged powerline that emitted sparks that ignited overgrown vegetation. The MFD/ATF reports classified the cause of the fire as accidental. 
 In the 2024 Hawaii Legislative session, bills were proposed (1) to create a statewide wildfire relief fund to compensate participating property owners, insurers, and government entities for damages resulting from future catastrophic wildfires; (2) to establish a process for the PUC to review and approve risk-based wildfire protection plans for electric utilities; and (3) to authorize the PUC to issue bonds securitized by future rate payments to pay for the risk-based wildfire protection plans and certain other costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The bills passed all committees and made it to the conference committee the last stop in the Hawaii Legislature before the final reading but they did not progress out of conference committee. Thereafter, Governor Josh Green announced the creation of a Hawaii Climate Advisory Team, which the Governor s office stated in a news release would recommend steps to create a durable fund to mitigate the impacts of dynamic climate change and to develop a fair and comprehensive structure to resolve claims related to future disasters including develop[ing] a customized go-forward fund structure and related claims settlement mechanics. As to the wildfire mitigation plan and securitization bill, the Governor s office stated in a letter that Hawaii s energy future and the stability and reliability of the utility is riding on this bill and later stated to news outlets that the Governor plans to continue negotiations and discussions with the goal of having the bill reintroduced at the next Hawaii legislative session in 2025. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, economic conditions in Hawaii remained stable with seasonally adjusted unemployment rate at 2.9 for September 2024 and the average daily passenger count was 3.9 higher than the comparable period in the prior year. While economic conditions remained stable during the quarter, the Utility s kWh sales in the third quarter of 2024 were down by 1.6 , compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to a decrease in Maui sales from the Maui windstorm and wildfires and the continued adoption of energy efficiency measures and distributed energy resources. While the level of kWh sales does not affect Utility revenues due to decoupling, it may increase or decrease the price per kWh paid by customers. See Decoupling in Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the decoupling mechanism. 
 At the Bank, net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.82 as compared to 2.79 and 2.70 for the prior quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in net interest margin was primarily due to the continued benefit from the sale of investment securities in the fourth quarter 2023 which was used to pay down maturing higher costing liabilities during the first quarter 2024. In addition, yields from earning assets increased primarily due to higher loan yields. 
 ASB s funding cost, which impacts its net interest margin, is driven by the mix of its funding sources, with the lowest cost source of funding provided by its core deposits. At September 30, 2024, core deposits were down approximately 2.1 from year end 2023, resulting in an increase in its overall cost of funds. Looking forward, ASB expects that its deposit base will remain relatively flat to down, given the higher interest rate environment, as well as inflationary pressures on customers that may drive increased spending. ASB also expects that the higher interest rate environment will continue to pressure funding costs and its deposit mix as customers move funds into higher costing certificate of deposits, which in turn will affect net interest income and net interest margin. 
 Since its peak in June 2022, monthly inflation rates have decreased as reflected in the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) to a moderate level of 2.4 as of September 30, 2024. Inflationary pressures have not dissipated, which may result in additional Federal Reserve interest rate cuts going forward. 
 Short-term interest rates still remain elevated as a result of the Federal Reserve s rate increases to the federal funds target rate from March 2022 through July 2023. Although the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates in September 2024 by 1/2 percentage point, t he higher interest rate environment has impacted the fair value of the Bank s investment portfolio, which declined and was recorded as an other comprehensive loss. Unrealized losses on held-to-maturity (HTM) securities are not recorded to other comprehensive loss because ASB has the intent and ability to hold the securities till maturity and recover its full investment. At September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses on HTM securities not recorded to other comprehensive losses was approximately 53 million after tax. 
 In September 2024, Pacific Current recorded a pretax long-lived asset impairment charge of 35.2 million after determining it was more-likely-than-not that the long-lived assets of Pacific Current will be sold significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life and that the fair value of certain long-lived assets of Pacific Current were less than its carrying value. The impairment charge was non-cash in nature and did not affect the Company s current liquidity, cash flows or 
 74 

any debt covenants under the Company s existing credit agreements. See Note 3 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

 The Company s effective tax rates for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 were 30 tax benefit and 15 tax expense, respectively. The Company s effective tax rates for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 26 tax benefit and 20 tax expense, respectively. The effective tax rates for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 were higher than the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to the substantial pretax loss and the smaller impact of permanent items on the effective tax rates including higher non-taxable bank-owned life insurance, higher tax-exempt interest, and federal research and development tax credit claims in 2024, partially offset by an increase in excess taxes related to vesting of share-based awards, no dividend deduction due to suspension of dividends, and lower amortization in 2024 of the Utilities regulatory liability related to certain excess deferred income taxes resulting from the Tax Act s decrease in the federal income tax rate.

See Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Note: Other segment Maui windstorm and wildfires related expenses - legal, outside services and other are included in Expenses-Other and interest expense is included Interest expense, net other than on deposit liabilities and other bank borrowings on the HEI and subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. See Electric utility and Bank sections below for more detail. 
 Since the Maui windstorm and wildfires on August 8, 2023 through September 30, 2024, HEI and its subsidiaries have incurred approximately 2.2 billion of Maui windstorm and wildfires expenses, including the Utilities estimate of the losses related to a settlement of all wildfire tort-related legal claims and cross claims and the One Ohana Initiative contribution. Certain of these costs are reimbursable under excess liability insurance, professional liability and directors and officers liability insurance policies. As of September 30, 2024, HEI and its subsidiaries have approximately 16 million, nil and 130 million of insurance coverage remaining under the excess liability, professional liability and directors and officers liability policies, respectively, after deducting applicable retention amounts and estimated insurance recoveries, including the One Ohana Initiative contribution. 
 With the Company accruing its losses related to a settlement of all wildfire tort-related legal claims and cross claims as of September 30, 2024, the Company still expects the Electric utility and HEI to continue to incur primarily legal expenditures in connection with the Maui windstorm and wildfires; however, the Company has partially mitigated the financial impact through insurance recoveries as well as the Utilities obtaining deferral treatment for incremental non-labor expense. At ASB, the lessening of loss uncertainties related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires have had a positive impact on its provision for credit losses, improving loss rates and lower loan portfolio balances. 
 Economic conditions. 
 Note: The statistical data in this section is from public third-party sources that management believes to be reliable (e.g., Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism (DBEDT), University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization (UHERO), U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (DLIR), Hawaii Tourism Authority (HTA), Honolulu Board of REALTORS and national and local news media). 
 In the third quarter, the average daily passenger count was 3.9 higher than the comparable period in the prior year. The recovery in total passenger counts from the low levels in 2020, which occurred under COVID-19 restrictions, thus far has been driven by domestic travelers, with international travelers, including Japanese travelers, remaining at lower levels. In the third quarter, international visitor arrivals (excluding Japan) remained 22.8 below 2019 levels. Due to the weak yen, Japanese visitors are 40.5 below 2019 levels. 
 Hawaii s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in September 2024 was 2.9 , which was slightly lower compared to the September 2023 rate of 3.0 . The national unemployment rate in September 2024 was 4.1 compared to 3.8 in September 2023. According to the most recent forecast by UHERO, issued on September 20, 2024, job growth in the state will decrease to 0.7 for 2024 and 0.8 for 2025. Although visitor recovery after the wildfires was somewhat stronger than expected, that recovery has now stalled as Maui hotels are seeing falling occupancy rates. Similarly, employment on Maui remains on a slow, delayed path to recovery, and remains more than 4,000 jobs below pre-wildfire levels. Unemployment in Maui County is predicted to average 4.0 in 2024, slightly receding to 3.5 by 2026. 
 Hawaii real estate activity through September 2024, as indicated by Oahu s home resale market, resulted in an increase in the median sales price of 1.0 for condominiums and an increase of 4.8 for single-family homes compared to the same period in 2023, with the September median single-family home price of 1,112,722, below the record 1,153,500 set in May 2022. The number of closed sales through September 2024 decreased 5.6 for condominiums and increased 5.8 for single-family residential homes compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Hawaii s petroleum product prices relate to the crude oil in international markets. The price of crude oil has decreased about 7.9 over the same quarter in the prior year. 
 At its September 18, 2024 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to lower the federal funds rate target range by 1/2 percentage point to 4.75 - 5.0 . The FOMC s decision reflects a greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. The Federal Reserve stated that it will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities. 
 77 

UHERO forecasts full year 2024 real GDP growth of 1.0 , an increase in total visitor arrivals of 0.9 , an increase in real personal income of 1.4 , and an unemployment rate of 3.0 for the state. The post-wildfire recovery of the Maui visitor industry has stalled, while tourism across the rest of the state has remained strong amongst favorable economic conditions. Although the 2024 U.S. economy continues to expand supported by strong consumer spending and business investment there are signs of economic weakening, including in the labor markets. While this may result in a slowing of the U.S. economy, a recession is not expected in the coming months.

 Three months ended September 30 (in thousands) 2024 2023 Primary reason(s) Revenues 3,622 5,912 The revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were lower than the comparable period in 2023 primarily due to lower sales at Pacific Current 1 subsidiaries. 
 Operating loss (45,156) (8,806) The higher operating loss is due to a 35.2 million impairment loss on certain long-lived assets at Pacific Current. Corporate expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were 1.4 million higher than the same period in 2023.

 Operating loss (74,773) (20,197) The first nine months of 2024 and 2023 include 45.7 million and 1.8 million of operating loss, respectively, from Pacific Current 1 . The higher operating loss is primarily due to a 35.2 million impairment loss on certain long-lived assets at Pacific Current in the third quarter of 2024, 3.5 million impairment loss on assets damaged in a March 2024 fire at Mahipapa and lower Pacific Current asset performances mainly at Hamakua Energy and Mahipapa due to unexpected plant shut downs in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year period. Corporate expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were 10.7 million higher than the same period in 2023, primarily due to 6.9 million of higher Maui windstorm and wildfires related costs, net of insurance recovery for the first nine months of 2024 than the same period in 2023.

 1 Hamakua Energy s sales to Hawaii Electric Light (a regulated affiliate) are eliminated in consolidation. 
 The other business segment loss includes results of the stand-alone corporate operations of HEI (including eliminations of intercompany transactions) and ASB Hawaii, Inc. (ASB Hawaii), as well as the results of Pacific Current, a direct subsidiary of HEI focused on investing in clean energy and sustainable infrastructure projects; Pacific Current s indirect subsidiary, Hamakua Energy, which owns a 60 MW combined cycle power plant on Hawaii Island that provides electricity to Hawaii Electric Light; Pacific Current s subsidiaries, Mauo, LLC (Mauo), which owns solar-plus-storage projects totaling 8.6 MW on five University of Hawaii campuses, Mahipapa, which owns a 7.5 MW nameplate biomass facility on Kauai, Alenuihaha Developments, LLC, which owns a collection of renewable energy assets on Oahu and Kauai, Ka ie ie Waho Company, LLC, which owns a 6 MW solar photovoltaic system that provides renewable energy to Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, and Ka aipua a, LLC, which is constructing a wastewater treatment and energy recovery facility on Hawaii Island; as well as eliminations of intercompany transactions. 
 In September 2024, Pacific Current recorded a pretax long-lived asset impairment charge of 35.2 million after determining it was more-likely-than-not that the long-lived assets of Pacific Current will be sold significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life and that the fair value of certain long-lived assets of Pacific Current were less than its carrying value. In addition, HEI forgave its intercompany loan receivable from Mahipapa, including accrued interest, amounting to 9.6 million. Concurrently, Mahipapa classified its intercompany loan payable to HEI, including accrued interest, 
 78 

of an equivalent amount as an equity contribution. These transactions were accounted for as equity transactions and offset in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The impairment charge and intercompany loan transactions were non-cash in nature and did not affect the Company s current liquidity, cash flows or any debt covenants under the Company s existing credit agreements. 
 In late February 2024, Hamakua Energy s first combustion turbine (CT1) and its leased combustion turbine (leased CT) unexpectedly sustained damages resulting in a plant shut down on Hawaii Island. The Company is currently conducting an investigation into the root cause of the damages. Upon inspection of CT1, it was determined that the unit was not serviceable. Due to the generation capacity shortfall on Hawaii Island (refer to System reliability in Recent developments of Hawaiian Electric s MD A below , and the extensive timeline and cost to overhaul CT1, management decided to retire and replace CT1. Due to the age of the unit, the net book value is immaterial. In April 2024, Hamakua Energy purchased a new combustion turbine and installed the unit in May 2024 at a total cost of approximately 8.3 million. The new CT1 was placed into service in June 2024. Pursuant to the lease pool program agreement, the leased CT was returned to the lessor and a new leased CT had been delivered and placed into service in September 2024 bringing Hamakua Energy back to full capacity. Hamakua Energy s second combustion turbine (CT2) is currently in a scheduled overhaul which has incurred delays due to supply shortages. The CT2 overhaul is expected to be completed and the unit placed back into service in the first quarter of 2025. Hamakua Energy is currently working with its legal counsel and insurance company on seeking recovery of its losses related to damages sustained to its plant facilities. 
 In March 2024, a fire destroyed the cooling tower at the Mahipapa facility on Kauai. The fire was ignited from a vendor s welding activities being performed on the cooling tower during its scheduled maintenance. As a result, the plant is currently shut down while repairs are being performed. Mahipapa recorded an impairment loss of 3.5 million in March 2024. The Company expects to complete its repairs and bring the facility back online in the fourth quarter of 2024. Mahipapa is currently working with its legal counsel and insurance company on seeking reimbursement of its losses related to damages sustained to its plant facilities. 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Liquidity and capital resources. See Credit and Capital Market Risk in Item 1A. Risk Factors in HEI s and Hawaiian Electric s 2023 Form 10-K and in Item 1A. Risk Factors below. 
 As of September 30 2024, the Utilities accrued estimated wildfire liabilities of approximately 1.92 billion (pre-tax), related to the settlement of the Maui windstorm and wildfire tort-related legal claims (see Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, HEI and its subsidiaries incurred net losses of approximately 104 million and 1.36 billion, respectively. 
 HEI and the Utilities future results of operations involve significant risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect HEI s and the Utilities future operating results and could cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, access to capital, ability to attract and retain key personnel, and pending or threatened litigation (including recent litigation noted above). 
 Management believes HEI s and the Utilities current combined cash balance, excluding ASB, at September 30, 2024 of 825.3 million and the available capacity on Hawaiian Electric s ABL facility (see Note 6 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), additional liquidity under HEI s recently registered ATM program as well as expenditure reduction efforts have effectively alleviated the conditions that caused substantial doubt regarding HEI s and Utilities ability to continue as a going concern, as the Company has available sufficient liquidity to fund the first installment of the settlement of wildfire tort claims expected to be made in late 2025 and the Company s other cash obligations for the next 12 months following the issuance of its financial statements. The plans that have been implemented have mitigated the conditions that previously caused the substantial doubt about HEI s and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern as of the date of filing its 2024 second quarter financial statements. HEI is working with its financial advisors on additional financing plans to raise capital necessary to fund the remaining settlement amount. See Note 1 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. If the financing plans are unsuccessful, the Company may need to consider other strategic alternatives. See further discussion in Part II. Other Information Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 At the end of the quarter, HEI and Hawaiian Electric had no commercial paper outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, ASB s unused FHLB borrowing capacity was approximately 1.5 billion and ASB had unpledged investment securities of 1.1 billion that were available to be used as collateral for additional borrowing capacity. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total amount of available borrowing capacity (net of commercial paper outstanding) under the Company s committed lines of credit was nil. As of September 30, 2024, HEI consolidated has 2.8 billion of long-term debt, net - other than bank, of which 60 million is due within 12 months and 284 million is due within 24 months. 
 79 

As of September 30, 2024, HEI s cash and cash equivalents balance, excluding its subsidiaries, was 677.7 million, compared to 137 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents balance was primarily the result of the sale of common stock in September 2024. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents, including the additional liquidity under its 250 million ATM program, would be sufficient to meet the Company s cash requirements in the next 12 months following the issuance of the financial statements. However, the Company expects that liquidity will continue to be impacted in the long-term primarily due to the remaining liability payments to settle wildfire claims; the result of the August 2023 downgrades of their credit ratings to below investment grade which prevents the Company from accessing unsecured, short-term borrowings and continues to restrict access to the capital markets and other sources of debt and equity financing in a timely manner and on acceptable terms; extended plant shutdowns at Pacific Current s Mahipapa facility; and higher working capital requirements resulting from inflation and elevated fuel prices. Although the Company has raised sufficient cash to pay the first installment of the settlement of wildfire tort claims, the Company is currently working with its financial advisors on a financing plan to raise the additional capital necessary to fund the remaining settlement of wildfire tort claims. While management believes the Company will be able to raise the necessary capital, there is no assurance that management s plans will be successful. 
 For the Utilities, while fuel prices have moderated from their highs in 2022, they remain elevated and have increased the cost of carrying fuel inventory and higher customer accounts receivable balances as fuel is consumed and billed to customers. While the accounts receivable balance has decreased since December 2023, it remains elevated coming out of the pandemic and has led to higher bad debt expense and higher write-offs in 2023 and year-to-date 2024, following the end of the moratorium on disconnections. The higher bad debt expense is expected to continue until the Utilities return to pre-pandemic accounts receivable balances, along with a decrease in volume, for delinquent accounts. The Maui windstorm and wildfires have not and are not anticipated to materially impact accounts receivable, however, it has and will continue to lead to higher bad debt expense. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 16.3 million of the Utilities accounts receivables were over 30 days past due, which is a decrease of approximately 26 since December 2023. In addition to the cash flow impact from delayed collection of accounts receivable, lower kWh sales relative to the level of kWh sales approved in the last rate case generally result in delayed timing of cash flows, resulting in higher working capital requirements (see Recent Developments in the Electric utility section below). 
 If further liquidity is deemed necessary in the short term, Hawaiian Electric could also use its available capacity on its 250 million ABL facility, reduce the pace of capital spending related to non-essential projects, manage O M expenses, seek borrowings on a secured basis, and explore asset sales. 
 At ASB, liquidity remains at satisfactory levels. ASB s cash and cash equivalents was 333 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 435 million as of December 31, 2023. ASB remains well above the well capitalized level under the FDIC Improvement Act prompt correction action capital category, and while the Hawaii economic outlook remains stable, there are emerging risks from potential continued turmoil in the banking industry, inflation, higher interest rates and the tightening of monetary policy that increase the risk of a recession, which could create increased uncertainty regarding the impact on loan performance and the allowance for credit losses (see Recent Developments in the Bank section below). 
 HEI Consolidated material cash requirements . Material cash requirements of HEI Consolidated include: payments related to settlement of tort-related legal claims and cross claims, Utility related capital expenditures (including capital expenditures related to wildfires and wildfire mitigations), labor and benefit costs, O M expenses, legal and consulting costs related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires, fuel and purchase power costs, and debt and interest payments; Bank related investments in loans; HEI related labor and benefits costs, debt and interest payments and legal and consulting costs related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires and HEI equity contributions to support Pacific Current s sustainable infrastructure investments. 
 The Company s credit rating downgrades related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires will continue to adversely impact its ability to access capital markets and other sources of debt and equity financing, if at all, in a timely manner and on acceptable terms. Through the sale of common stock in September 2024, the Company has raised sufficient cash to pay the first installment of the settlement of wildfire tort claims expected to be made in late 2025. The Company is currently working with its financial advisors on a financing plan to raise the additional capital required to fund its remaining wildfire tort claims. While management believes the Company will be able to raise the necessary capital, there is no assurance that management s plans will be successful. The potential damages and losses related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires and related lawsuits (see further information in Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), the suspension of dividends from its subsidiaries, the economic impact of higher fuel prices, inflation, higher interest rates, tightening of monetary policy and geopolitical situations, create significant uncertainty, and the Company cannot predict the extent or duration of these conditions, the future effects that these conditions will have on the Company s financing plan, cost of capital and its ability to access additional capital, or the future impacts on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

The consolidated capital structure of HEI (excluding deposit liabilities and other bank borrowings) was as follows: (dollars in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Long-term debt, net other than bank 2,837 64 2,842 54 Preferred stock of subsidiaries 34 1 34 1 Common stock equity 1,577 35 2,345 45 4,448 100 5,221 100 
 On August 26, 2024, S P revised HEI s outlook to Watch Negative from Negative and affirmed the B- issuer credit rating. On October 25, 2024, Fitch updated HEI s outlook to Stable from Watch Negative , while affirming the B issuer credit rating. The downgrades of HEI s credit ratings will continue to adversely impact its ability to access capital markets and other sources of debt financing, if at all, in a timely manner and on acceptable terms. 
 On September 25, 2024, HEI completed the sale of 62.2 million shares of common stock. The shares were issued under a registration statement registering up to 575 million of common stock. The net proceeds from the sale of common stock amounted to approximately 557.7 million and will be used to fund the Company s contribution to the expected Maui wildfire tort litigation settlement and for general corporate purposes. 
 On September 19, 2024, HEI filed with the SEC an at-the-market (ATM) offering program under which HEI may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, its common stock, without par value, having an aggregate offering price of up to 250 million. To date, HEI has not sold any common stock under this program. 
 There were no new issuances of common stock through the Dividend Reinvestment Program (DRIP), HEIRSP or the ASB 401(k) Plan in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, net cash provided by operating activities of HEI consolidated was 351 million. Net cash used by investing activities for the same period was 24 million, primarily due to capital expenditures and ASB s contributions to low income housing investments and purchase of FHLB stock, net of redemption, partly offset by ASB s net decrease in loans held for investment, receipt of investment security repayments and maturities and sale of commercial loans. Net cash provided by financing activities during this period was 152 million primarily due to net proceeds from issuance of common stock, partly offset by net decreases in ASB s other bank borrowings and deposit liabilities. 
 Dividends. The payout ratios for the first nine months of 2024 and full year 2023 were nil and 59 , respectively. The HEI Board of Directors evaluates the dividend quarterly and considers many factors in the evaluation including, but not limited to, the Company s results of operations, the long-term prospects for the Company, current and expected future economic conditions, and capital investment alternatives. In August 2023, due to the potential impact from the Maui windstorm and wildfires, the HEI Board of Directors voted to suspend the quarterly cash dividend, starting after the second quarter dividend. This action is intended to allow the Company to provide additional liquidity and allocate cash to rebuilding and restoring power and help ensure a strong future for the Utilities and Bank. The ASB Board of Directors determined to suspend its quarterly cash dividends to HEI, starting after the second quarter 2023 dividend, to help ensure maximum possible Bank liquidity and capital. The Hawaiian Electric Board of Directors determined it would suspend its quarterly dividends to HEI, starting with the second quarter 2024 dividend, which would have been paid in the third quarter of 2024. The decision of the Hawaiian Electric Board of Directors to suspend its dividend to HEI was based upon the size of the proposed settlement of wildfire tort litigation and the fact that, although HEI and the Utilities have sufficient liquidity to fund the first settlement payment, no definitive funding plan currently exists for the remaining settlement payment liability. 
 MATERIAL ESTIMATES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 In preparing financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 
 In accordance with SEC Release No. 33-8040, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies, management has identified the accounting policies it believes to be the most critical to the Company s financial statements that is, management believes that these policies are both the most important to the portrayal of the Company s results of operations and financial condition, and currently require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. 
 For information about these material estimates and critical accounting policies, in addition to the critical policy discussed below, see pages 48 to 50, 67, and 80 to 81 of the MD A included in Part II, Item 7 of HEI s and Hawaiian Electric s 2023 Form 10-K.

Following are discussions of the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources of the electric utility and bank segments. 
 
 Electric utility 
 Recent developments. See also Recent developments, which includes disclosures relating to Maui windstorm and wildfires in HEI s MD A. 
 In 2024, the Utilities accrued estimated wildfire liabilities of approximately 1.92 billion (pre-tax) related to the settlement of the Maui windstorm and wildfire tort-related legal claims (see Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Utilities incurred net losses of approximately 83 million and 1.27 billion, respectively. 
 In the third quarter of 2024 , operation and maintenance expenses were higher by approximately 20 million, or 14 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to more generation maintenance work performed, wildfire mitigation program expenditures related to inspections, higher property and general liability insurance costs, and an agreement to settle indemnification claims asserted by the State of Hawaii, partially offset by costs incurred associated with the Maui windstorm and wildfires in 2023. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, kWh sales volume increased 1.6 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase reflects the recovery since the Maui windstorm and wildfires as Maui consumption increased 3.8 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Additionally, increased tourism, especially on Oahu, in 2024 further contributed to the increase of kWh sales. 
 The price of crude oil has decreased about 7.9 over the same quarter in the prior year. The Utilities are able to pass through fuel costs to customers and have limited fuel cost exposure through a 2 fuel cost-risk sharing mechanism (approximately 3.7 million maximum exposure annually). 
 In September 2024, the consumer price index increased 2.4 over the last 12 months. In Hawaii, the September 2024 Urban Hawaii (Honolulu) Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 4.2 over the last 12 months. Under the PBR framework, inflation risk for the Utilities is partially mitigated by an Annual Rate Adjustment (ARA), which is based on a formula that includes a compounded and non-compounded portion. 
 The compounded portion of the ARA adjustment includes an adjustment for the annual change in inflation based on the estimated change in Gross Domestic Product Price Index (GDPPI) for the upcoming year, less a predetermined annual productivity factor (currently set at zero), less a 0.22 customer dividend, applied to a basis equal to test year target revenues plus the RAM Revenue adjustments in effect prior to the implementation of PBR, plus the prior adjustment year s compounded portion of the ARA adjustment. The inflation factor percentage is the consensus projection of annual percentage change in GDPPI for the following calendar year published by Blue Chip Economic Indicators each October. For the 2024 calendar year, the forecasted 2024 GDPPI was 2.18 (net of the 0.22 customer dividend), measured in October 2023, and became effective in rates on January 1, 2024. For the 2025 calendar year, the forecasted 2025 GDPPI was 1.98 (net of the 0.22 customer dividend), measured in October 2024, and is scheduled to become effective in rates on January 1, 2025, pending PUC approval. 
 The non-compounded portion of the ARA adjustment includes a subtractive component, representing the management audit savings commitment, or refund to customers, which was approved by the PUC for the years 2021 through 2025. 
 Customer accounts receivable decreased in 2024 by 36 million, or 15 with the number of accounts past due greater than 90 days decreasing by 43 since December 31, 2023. The decrease in accounts receivables was primarily driv en by receipt of government and other program assistance, higher cash receipts associated with increased disconnection efforts and a change in bill due date from 19 days to 15 days in March 2024, along with lower customer bills resulting from lower fuel prices. At this time, while accounts receivable balances continue to remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels, with the exception for Maui County, which has been trending down closer to pre-pandemic levels, the decrease in accounts receivable balances since the beginning of the year has reduced working capital requirements and benefited the Utilities liquidity. See Financial Condition Liquidity and capital resources for additional information. 
 System reliability . On March 25, 2024, t he Utilities called on Hawaii Island customers to reduce or shift their electricity usage, and in certain instances initiated rolling outages due to a generation capacity shortfall. The situation was due to Hamakua Energy s unexpected plant shutdown in late February 2024 and also due to the unavailability of generators that have experienced mechanical problems, were at reduced output, or were undergoing maintenance. During that time, generation margins were below targeted levels, especially when wind, solar and hydroelectric output were lower than forecasted. On April 24, 2024, the Utilities lifted their request to conserve electricity as several of the Utilities large generators returned to service and on June 3, 2024 Hamakua Energy completed replacement of one combustion turbine and returned it to service. The second 
 82 

combustion turbine returned to service on September 9, 2024. See above in HEI MD A- Other segment for discussion relating to Hamakua Energy s unexpected plant shutdown. 
 Since the August 2023 Maui windstorm and wildfires, the Utilities have developed a set of Interim Wildfire Safety Measures (IWSM) to mitigate the risk of wildfires in areas identified as having higher risk of wildfire in all service territories (Oahu, Maui County, and Hawaii Island). These interim measures represent actions the Utilities either have already started, or will start in 2024, while the Utilities simultaneously work to develop a more comprehensive Wildfire Safety Strategy. In the near term, it is anticipated that these measures will result in disruptions to service and negatively impact T D SAIDI and SAIFI. While the Utilities work to refine these measures over time to mitigate customer impacts, the Utilities are currently focused on taking immediate steps to keep island communities safe during extreme weather events. For a discussion regarding the launch of the Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) program, see discussion below under Interim Wildfire Safety Measures. 
 Regulatory developments . On November 15, 2021, President Biden signed into law the 1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which includes approximately 550 billion of new federal spending to be allocated over the next five years through various programs. The funding will help t he State of Hawaii achieve its sustainability goals, including renewable energy, resilience, and decarbonization, while also prioritizing economic development, equity and affordability. The Utilities are pursuing potential grant funding of projects under various programs as primary applicant as well as in partnership with other organizations. On August 7, 2024, the Utilities received a notification from the U.S. Department of Energy that their application for 95 million in federal funds under IIJA has been awarded. The Utilities had submitted two full applications that if awarded, would allow for reduction up to 112 million in the Utilities recovery under the Exceptional Project Recovery Mechanism (EPRM) and cost to customers. In October 2024, the Utilities were notified that they were not selected in this second round of IIJA funding opportunities. See Regulatory proceedings in Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussions. 
 On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) that provides for 258 billion in energy-related provisions over a 10-year period. The provisions of the IRA are intended to, among other things, lower gasoline and electricity prices, incentivize clean energy investment and promote reductions in carbon emissions. The Utilities are exploring clean energy tax incentives included in the IRA that may further reduce the Utilities recovery under the EPRM and cost to customers. See Note 11 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 The Utilities cannot predict the ultimate timing and success of securing funding from any federal government programs .

 3 Pursuant to an agreement to settle indemnification claims with the State of Hawaii. See Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 4 kWh sales were higher compared to the same quarter in prior year. The increase in sales can be attributed to increased tourism on Oahu and the recovery from the Maui windstorm and wildfires. 
 The Utilities effective tax rates for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 were 30 tax benefit and 21 tax expense, respectively. The Utilities effective tax rates for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 26 tax benefit and 22 tax expense, respectively. The effective tax rates for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, were higher than the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to the substantial pretax loss resulting from the accrual of the loss contingencies related to the wildfire tort-related claims and the smaller impact of permanent items on the effective tax rates including federal research and development tax credit claims in 2024, partially offset by an increase in excess taxes related to vesting of share-based awards, and lower amortization in 2024 of the Utilities regulatory liability related to certain excess deferred income taxes resulting from the Tax Act s decrease in the federal income tax rate. 
 Hawaiian Electric s consolidated ROACE was not meaningful and 7.9 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 For more information of the Utilities incremental expenses related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , see Results of operations Maui windstorm and wildfires related expenses in HEI s MD A. 
 The net book value (cost less accumulated depreciation) of utility property, plant and equipment (PPE) as of September 30, 2024 amounted to 5.6 billion, of which approximately 20 related to generation PPE, 64 related to transmission and distribution PPE, and 16 related to other PPE. Approximately 6 of the total net book value relates to generation PPE that has been deactivated or that the Utilities plan to deactivate or decommission by 2046. 
 See Economic conditions in the HEI Consolidated section above. 
 Executive overview and strategy. The Utilities provide electricity on all the principal islands in the state, other than Kauai, to approximately 95 of the state s population, and operate five separate grids. The Utilities mission is to provide innovative energy leadership for Hawaii, to meet the needs and expectations of customers and communities, and to empower them with affordable, reliable and clean energy. The goal is to create a safe, modern, resilient, flexible, and dynamic electric grid that protects Hawaii from impacts of climate change and enables an optimal mix of distributed energy resources, such as private rooftop solar, demand response, and grid-scale resources to enable the creation of smart, sustainable, resilient communities and achieve their decarbonization goals that are aligned with the statutory goal of 100 renewable energy by 2045. 
 Performance-based regulations. On December 23, 2020, the PUC issued a D O (PBR D O) approving a new performance-based regulation framework (PBR Framework). See Regulatory proceedings in Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Interim Wildfire Safety Measures. The Utilities first began developing a Wildfire Safety Strategy in 2019 and continue to adapt the plan to address the elevated risks in Hawaii. Since the Maui windstorm and wildfires, the Utilities have developed a set of Interim Wildfire Safety Measures to reduce the risk of wildfires associated with utility infrastructure in service territory areas identified as posing a higher wildfire risk. These interim measures represent actions the Utilities have either already started, or will start in 2024, while simultaneously working to develop a more comprehensive strategy. These actions include wildfire risk analysis, operation procedures and grid design changes, enhanced inspection and vegetation management plans, and system hardening. 
 One of the interim measures is the Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) program, which calls for the Utilities to preventatively de-energize circuits in areas identified as high fire risk during certain weather conditions. The PSPS program launched on July 1, 2024 and is ready to use, if and when it is needed, and as the last line of defense to protect customers, communities and employees. The initial PSPS protocols and operational procedures represent an early-stage iteration, which will evolve over time as more analytical, forecast, and situational awareness capabilities and wildfire mitigations are deployed. De-energizing circuits in high wildfire risk areas will lead to extended interruptions for many customers, even if not in a high wildfire risk area. The Utilities will continue to work with key stakeholders in balancing the risk of utility-related wildfires with the public consequences of not having electricity. 
 Transition to a decarbonized and sustainable energy future. The Utilities are fully committed to leading and enabling pathways to a decarbonized and sustainable energy future for Hawaii. A sustainable energy future is one that focuses on delivering electricity safely, reliably and affordably, strengthening resilience and shifting away from fossil-fueled resources. The Utilities believe that a holistic approach to climate change is needed, working on both climate mitigation efforts along with 
 86 

climate adaptation efforts. Climate mitigation requires achieving the Utilities decarbonization and renewable energy commitments, facilitating and promoting beneficial electrification, and deploying carbon removal and offsets among other levers to reduce statewide emissions. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Utilities outlined their Climate Action Plan to cut carbon emissions from power generation 70 by 2030, compared to a 2005 baseline. The emissions covered by this goal include stack emissions from generation owned by Hawaiian Electric and IPPs who sell electricity to the Utilities. Since that time, delays and cancellations in the commercial operation of new renewable third-party generation resources and higher costs as a result of supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, as well as federal policies related to solar panel imports have slowed the pace of progress toward reducing GHG emissions. Also, see the Developments in renewable energy efforts New renewable PPAs section below. The downgrade of Hawaiian Electric s credit ratings after the Maui windstorm and wildfires is anticipated to be an additional impediment to completion of new renewable energy and storage projects. As a result of these challenges, the Utilities expect the planned 70 reduction in carbon emissions to be achieved later than the original 2030 target date. However, the Utilities will continue to replace significant amounts of fossil fuel generation with renewable energy between now and 2030 and expect to meet or exceed the State of Hawaii s RPS goals. 
 Hawaiian Electric has also committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2045 or sooner. While the timing of the Utilities carbon reduction goals will be adjusted, key elements of the 2030 plan have already been completed or remain on track to be completed by 2030, including the closure of the state s last coal-fired IPP plant that occurred in September 2022, increasing rooftop solar by more than 50 over 2021 levels, retiring six fossil fuel generating units, increasing grid-scale and customer-owned storage, expanding geothermal resources, and creating customer incentives for using clean, lower-cost energy at certain times of the day and using less fossil-fueled energy at night. The retirement of fossil-fueled generating units is consistent with state policy and supported by Hawaii State law. 
 On September 1, 2022, the last coal-fired IPP plant in the state, providing approximately 10 of Oahu s generation, ceased operations, removing a significant source of GHG emissions from the Utilities generation mix. In advance of the retirement of the coal-fired IPP plant, the Utilities developed plans, including contingency plans, to ensure reliable service through the transition period. These plans include the anticipated addition of renewable energy/storage projects, reserve capacity from existing generation sources, the acceleration of maintenance work during periods with anticipated higher reserve levels, and multiple demand response/DER programs. For example, in 2024, the first solar-plus storage project on Maui, a 60 megawatt (MW) Stage 1 project which is the largest solar-plus storage project in the State of Hawaii, reached commercial operations on May 31, 2024. Additionally, a 12.5 MW Stage 1 solar-plus storage project on Oahu reached commercial operations on March 28, 2024. The first Stage 2 solar-plus storage project, a 42 MW project on Oahu, reached commercial operations on June 7, 2024. 
 Hawaii s renewable portfolio standard law requires electric utilities to meet an RPS of 30 , 40 , 70 and 100 by December 31, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2045, respectively. Hawaii law has also established a target of sequestering more atmospheric carbon and greenhouse gases than emitted within the state by 2045. The Utilities strategies and plans are fully aligned in meeting these targets (see also Integrated Grid Planning below). 
 The Utilities have made significant progress on the path to clean energy and have been successful in achieving RPS goals. To date the Utilities have met all of the statutory RPS goals, including exceeding the latest milestone RPS target of 30 for 2020, where it achieved an RPS of 34.5 . In July 2022, former Governor Ige signed Act 240 (H.B.2089), that amended the RPS calculation from renewable energy as a percentage of sales to renewable energy as a percentage of total generation. The amended RPS calculation results in a lower calculated percentage than the amount calculated under the previous methodology. For example, the 2022 RPS achieved under the revised RPS calculation was 31.8 versus 39.1 under the prior method. The change in the definition is effective from July 2022 forward and will require that the Utilities acquire more renewable energy than under the previous RPS calculation to comply with the RPS milestones; however, the Utilities expect to continue to meet the RPS milestones under the amended RPS law. (See Developments in renewable energy efforts below). 
 If the Utilities are not successful in meeting the RPS targets as mandated by law, the PUC could assess a penalty of 20 for every megawatt-hour (MWh) that an electric utility is deficient. Based on the level of total generation in 2023, a 1 shortfall in meeting the 2030 RPS requirement of 40 would translate into a penalty of approximately 2.1 million. The PUC has the discretion to reduce the penalty due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utility s reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated. In addition to penalties under the RPS law, failure to meet the mandated RPS targets would be expected to result in a higher proportion of fossil fuel-based generation than if the RPS target had been achieved, which in turn would be expected to subject the Utilities to limited commodity fossil fuel price exposure under a fuel cost risk-sharing mechanism. The fuel cost risk-sharing mechanism apportions 2 of the fuel cost risk to the utilities (and 98 to ratepayers) and has a maximum exposure (or benefit) of 3.7 million. Conversely, the Utilities have incentives under PIMs that provide a financial reward for accelerating the achievement of renewable generation as a percentage of total generation, including customer supplied generation. In 2023, the Utilities achieved a 33.3 RPS earning a 
 87 

reward of 444,116 based on 15/MWh in exceedance of 33.0 RPS. In 2024, the Utilities are eligible for a reward of 10/MWh in exceedance of 34.0 RPS. 
 The Utilities are fully aligned with, and supportive of, state policy to achieve a decarbonized future and have made significant progress in reducing emissions through renewable energy and electrification. This alignment with state policy is reflected in management compensation programs and the Utilities long-range plans, which include aspirational targets in order to catalyze action and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels throughout their operations at a pace more rapid than dictated by current law. The long-range plans, including aspirational targets, serve as guiding principles in the Utilities continued transformation, and are updated regularly to adapt to changing technology, costs, and other factors. While there is no financial penalty for failure to achieve the Utilities long-range aspirational objectives, the Utilities recognize that there are environmental and social costs from the continued use of fossil fuels. 
 The State of Hawaii s policy is supported by the regulatory framework and includes a number of mechanisms designed to maintain the Utilities financial stability during the transition toward the State s decarbonized future. Under the sales decoupling mechanism, the Utilities are allowed to recover from customers, target test year revenues, independent of the level of kWh sales, which have generally trended lower over time as privately-owned DER have been added to the grid and energy efficiency measures have been put into place. Other regulatory mechanisms under the PBR framework reduce some of the regulatory lag during the multi-year rate plan (MRP), such as the annual revenue adjustment to provide annual changes in utility revenues, including inflationary adjustments, and the exceptional project recovery mechanism, which allows the Utilities to recover and earn on certain approved eligible projects placed into service. See Regulatory proceedings in Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Integrated Grid Planning . Achieving high levels of renewable energy and a carbon free electric system will require modernizing the grid through coordinated energy system planning in partnership with local communities and stakeholders. To accomplish this, the Utilities are implementing an innovative systems approach to energy planning intended to yield the most cost-effective renewable energy and decarbonization pathways that incorporates customer and stakeholder input. 
 The Integrated Grid Planning (IGP) process utilizes an inclusive and transparent stakeholder engagement model to provide an avenue for interested parties to engage with the Utilities and contribute meaningful input throughout the IGP process. The IGP Stakeholder Council, Technical Advisory Panel and Working groups have been established and meet regularly to provide feedback and input on specific issues and process steps in the IGP. On March 7, 2024, the PUC accepted the Utilities final Integrated Grid Plan. The Integrated Grid Plan proposes actionable steps to decarbonize the electric grid on the State of Hawaii s timeline, with a flexible framework that can adapt to future technologies. The Integrated Grid Plan is the culmination of more than five years of partnership with stakeholders and community members across the islands. Together, they forecasted future energy needs and identified strategies to meet Hawaii s growing energy demand with 100 renewable resources. 
 On June 28, 2024, the Utilities filed their annual update of the Action Plan described in their 2023 final Integrated Grid Plan. 
 Demand response programs . Pursuant to PUC orders, the Utilities are developing an integrated Demand Response (DR) Portfolio Plan that will enhance system operations and reduce costs to customers. The reduction in cost for the customer will take the form of either rates or incentive-based programs that will compensate customers for their participation individually, or by way of engagements with turnkey service providers that contract with the Utilities to aggregate and deliver various grid services on behalf of participating customers and their distributed assets. 
 On June 8, 2021, the PUC approved the new program, Emergency Demand Response Program (EDRP), a battery storage incentive program to dispatch electricity between 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. daily from participating residential and commercial customers, to address the potential reserve shortfalls following the AES coal plant retirement. The Battery Bonus on Oahu is officially closed to new applications. As of September 30, 2024, the Utilities have received and approved applications totaling 46.45 MW on Oahu. 
 On March 30, 2022, the Utilities filed with the PUC to request expanding the EDRP for up to 15 MW on the island of Maui and received PUC approval on May 20, 2022. The EDRP on Maui became effective as of June 1, 2022. Subsequently on June 23, 2022, the PUC approved the cost recovery of the additional incentives for both Oahu and Maui through the Demand Side Management Surcharge. As of September 30, 2024, the Battery Bonus program on Maui has officially closed to new applications, and the Utilities have received and approved the applications totaling approximately 10.6 MW on Maui. 
 On September 20, 2024, the Utilities notified customers (approximately 1,200) participating in the Home Battery Rewards Program operated by certain third party service provider that the service provider has gone out of business. The Utilities notified the customers that they will halt the monthly grid service operation along with the monthly incentive payment. The Utilities are committed to the customers that an alternate solution is being worked on and will migrate the existing customers to the new pathway as soon as possible.

Grid modernization . The overall goal of the Grid Modernization Strategy (GMS) is to deploy modern grid investments at an appropriate priority, sequence and pace to cost-effectively maximize flexibility, minimize the risk of redundancy and obsolescence, deliver customer benefits and enable greater DER and renewable energy integration. On March 25, 2019, the PUC approved a plan for the Utilities to implement GMS Phase 1, which is the proportional deployment of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). On February 28, 2022, the PUC expanded the scope of Phase 1 to the full service territory with a completion date set for the third quarter of 2024. The estimated cost of full deployment (including proportional deployment) is approximately 143 million in capital and deferred software cost and is expected to be incurred over five years. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 129 million of capital and deferred software cost has been incurred to date under Phase 1 and is currently being recovered under the MPIR mechanism until such costs are included in base rates. As of September 30, 2024, the Utilities have completed the formal GMS Phase 1 project and deployed about 448,000 advanced meters, servicing approximately 95 of total customers. 
 The Utilities filed an application with the PUC on September 30, 2019 for an Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS) as part of Phase 2 of their GMS implementation. On March 31, 2021, the Utilities filed a supplement and update to the GMS Phase 2 ADMS application to include broad deployment of field devices, which the PUC suspended on November 16, 2021, to focus the Utilities attention on completing Phase 1. On April 17, 2023, the Utilities filed a motion with the PUC, requesting the suspended docket to be reopened and to allow the Utilities to file an updated and supplemented application for updated project costs and expansion of the Phase 2 scope to also include Operational Technology Cybersecurity Monitoring. On May 31, 2024, the Utilities filed another updated and supplemented application for updated project costs, as well as the addition of Private Long-Term Evolution expansion and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition expansion to the prior GMS Phase 2 scope (ADMS, Field Devices, and Operational Technology Cybersecurity Monitoring). The estimated cost for the implementation of GMS Phase 2 over seven years, which includes capital, deferred software costs and O M costs, is 215 million. The Utilities have requested PUC approval by the end of 2024. 
 Community-based renewable energy . In December 2017, the PUC adopted a community-based renewable energy (CBRE) program framework which allows customers who cannot, or chose not to, take advantage of private rooftop solar to receive the benefits of renewable energy to help offset their monthly electric bills and support clean energy for Hawaii. The program has two phases. 
 The first phase, which commenced in July 2018, totaling 8 MW of solar photovoltaic (PV) only with one credit rate for each island, closed on April 9, 2020. Two phase 1 projects (28.32 kW on Maui and 270 kW on Oahu) have been operational for three years and one Phase 1 project (3,000 kW on Oahu) achieved commercial operations on October 1, 2023. Two additional phase 1 projects achieved commercial operations on April 1, 2024 (Hawaii Island: 750kW and Molokai: 250kW). 
 The second phase, which commenced on April 9, 2020 and subsequently expanded on July 27, 2021, allows over 250 MW across all Hawaiian Electric service territories in two tranches for small (under 250 kW), mid-tier and large system sizes to encourage a variety of system sizes. To provide opportunities for low-to-moderate income (LMI) customers to participate in the program, 23 MW of capacity for dedicated-LMI projects were awarded on November 15, 2022 through three island specific RFPs for Oahu, Maui and Hawaii Island. LMI projects do not have a size cap nor do they decrease the 250 MW capacity available to other projects. Three projects have since been withdrawn by the selected CBRE developers and the remaining 14 MW of dedicated-LMI projects are expected to become operational in 2026. 
 The Utilities issued the CBRE Tranche 1 RFPs for Oahu, Maui and Hawaii on April 14, 2022. The RFPs closed on August 17, 2022, and proposals were evaluated. Tranche 1 projects, which are greater than or equal to 250 kW, were awarded on February 22, 2023. Two projects on Hawaii Island were subsequently withdrawn by the developer on October 18, 2023. Two additional Hawaii Island projects were disqualified on May 13, 2024. On June 14, 2024, a project on Oahu was withdrawn by the developer. There are no remaining Tranche 1 projects in development. 
 For Lanai, the Utilities combined the previously issued Variable Renewable Dispatchable Generation Paired with Energy Storage RFP and the CBRE RFP to optimize the benefits of procuring renewable energy, spur development and increase the likelihood of success of the CBRE Program on Lanai. See Developments in renewable energy efforts Requests for renewable proposals, expressions of interest, and information for additional information. 
 One CBRE proposal for Lanai was selected but negotiations were terminated on June 15, 2022. With the concurrence of the independent observer, a replacement proposal was selected on July 1, 2022. On July 25, 2022, the Utilities announced the selection of a new developer for the Lanai CBRE RFP. On September 21, 2022, the Utilities were informed by Pulama Lanai of a project being planned on Lanai to remove the two large resorts from the grid, which represent approximately 40 of the load of the island and raises great uncertainty around the future energy needs for Lanai. On September 28, 2022, the Utilities notified the PUC that ongoing negotiations for the Lanai CBRE project would continue, but the Utilities did not execute a PPA at this time given the uncertainty due to the Pulama Lanai notification. Unfortunately, due to the lapse in time from selection, the parties were unable to reach an agreement on a PPA and on October 23, 2024, the developer submitted a withdrawal letter to 
 89 

the Utilities. The Utilities are considering options for procuring renewable energy on Lanai. On Molokai, proposals were only received from a single community co-op group. After evaluation of these proposals and with concurrence of the independent observer, the Utilities filed a letter on September 9, 2022, proposing to close the Molokai CBRE RFP and to work with the lone bidder to improve certain aspects of their two proposed projects outside of the RFP process for the benefit of the residents of Molokai. After successful negotiations, two contracts for solar plus storage facilities were executed and on September 29, 2023, the Utilities filed two applications with the PUC requesting approval of the contracts. On January 8, 2024, the PUC approved the two contracts. 
 The Utilities CBRE Phase 2 Rule 29 became effective on March 10, 2022. The Utilities are currently accepting project applications for small CBRE projects less than 250 kW in size. The PUC reserved 45 MW as well as a small amount of unallocated capacity from Phase 1 for small projects in Phase 2 on Oahu, Maui and Hawaii Island. The Utilities have developed a CBRE Portal where Subscriber Organizations can apply for small project capacity and manage subscribers for all CBRE projects in the program. Customers can also use the CBRE Portal to solicit subscription quotes, compare, and subscribe to a project once the Subscriber Organization has added their project to the portal. 
 Microgrid services tariff proceeding . In enacting Act 200 of 2018, the Hawaii legislature found that Hawaii s residents and businesses were vulnerable to disruptions in the islands energy systems caused by extreme weather events or other disasters, and stated its belief that the use of microgrids would build energy resiliency into Hawaii s communities, thereby increasing public safety and security. The purpose of Act 200 was therefore to encourage and facilitate the development and use of microgrids through the establishment of a standard microgrid services tariff. In July 2018, pursuant to Act 200, the PUC opened a proceeding to investigate the establishment of a microgrid services tariff. In August 2019, the PUC issued an order prioritizing items for resolution in the docket and directed the Parties to establish working groups (the Working Group) to address issues identified by the PUC. 
 On May 27, 2021, the Utilities filed the Microgrid Service Tariff. On September 21, 2021, the PUC provided guidance for Phase 2 of the Microgrid Tariff proceeding, specifically identifying the objective for Phase 2 to promote self-sufficiency and resilience among microgrid project operators, as well as to further streamline the Microgrid Services Tariff where applicable. Furthermore, the PUC instructed Parties to recommend priority topics, along with supporting rationale to better inform the topics that will be discussed during this phase of the proceeding, which the parties submitted by October 21, 2021. 
 On April 1, 2022, the PUC established its Prioritized Issues for Resolution for Phase 2 of the Microgrid proceeding, which includes the following: 1) Microgrid Compensation and Grid Services; 2) Utility Compensation; 3) Customer Protection and Related Considerations; 4) Interconnection; and 5) Working Group coordination with related microgrid and resilience Initiatives at Hawaiian Electric and government agencies. Furthermore, the PUC established a procedural schedule to consist of quarterly status conference meetings with the PUC, a Phase 2 Working Group Report, draft of a revised Microgrid Service Tariff, Party comments to the proposed Microgrid Service Tariff, followed by a PUC D O. 
 On June 30, 2022, the PUC provided further guidance to the Working Group to prioritize discussion of the microgrid types in the following order: 1) Hybrid Microgrid - Third Party Developer using Utility lines/infrastructure; 2) Hybrid Microgrid - Utility Project with Partners; and 3) Customer Microgrid. Additionally, the PUC instructed the Working Group to discuss microgrid compensation and continue the involvement of microgrid developers in working group meetings. 
 The Working Group met from April 2022 through October 2022 to discuss the PUC s objectives and respond to the Phase 2 priority issues. On October 31, 2022, the PUC issued a guidance letter and advised that the Working Group propose a new timeline for the Report. The Utilities and the Consumer Advocate filed a joint letter with a revised timeline on November 10, 2022. On November 21, 2022, the PUC issued an order to suspend the Phase 2 procedural schedule while it reviews the joint letter. 
 Decoupling. See Decoupling in Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of decoupling. 
 Regulated returns. As part of the PBR Framework s annual review cycle, the Utilities track their rate-making ROACEs as calculated under the earnings sharing mechanism, which includes only items considered in establishing rates. At year-end, each utility s rate-making ROACE is compared against its ROACE allowed by the PUC to determine whether earnings sharing has been triggered. The D O in the PBR proceeding modified the earnings sharing mechanism to a symmetric arrangement. Effective with annual earnings for 2021, the earnings sharing will be triggered for achieved rate-making ROACE outside of a 300 basis points dead band above and below the current authorized rate-making ROACE of 9.5 for each of the Utilities. Earnings sharing credits or recoveries will be included in the biannual report (formally known as annual decoupling filing) to be filed with the PUC in the spring of the following year. Results for 2022 and 2021 did not trigger the earnings sharing mechanism for the Utilities. 
 On August 31, 2023, the PUC issued an order temporarily suspending the ESM until further notice. The intent of the order is to address the unintended consequence of customers potentially bearing the costs associated with the Maui windstorm and 
 90 

wildfires through the operation of the ESM without prior PUC review. In accordance with the order, the earnings sharing adjustment for 2023 is zero until the PUC lifts the suspension. 
 Actual and PUC-allowed returns, as of September 30, 2024, were as follows: 
 Rate-making Return on rate base (RORB) ROACE Rate-making ROACE Twelve months ended 
 September 30, 2024 
 Hawaiian Electric Hawaii Electric Light Maui Electric Hawaiian Electric Hawaii Electric Light Maui Electric Hawaiian Electric Hawaii Electric Light Maui Electric Utility returns NM NM NM NM NM NM NM NM NM PUC-allowed returns 7.37 7.52 7.43 9.50 9.50 9.50 9.50 9.50 9.50 
 Based on recorded operating income and average rate base, both adjusted for items not included in determining electric rates. 
 Recorded net income divided by average common equity. 
 ROACE adjusted to remove items not included by the PUC in establishing rates, such as incentive compensation. 
 NM - Not meaningful. 
 The Utility s actual and allowed rates of return are not meaningful due to the accrual of estimated wildfire liabilities of approximately 1.92 billion (see Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 The gap between PUC-allowed ROACEs and the ROACEs achieved is generally due to the exclusion of certain expenses from rates (for example, incentive compensation and charitable contributions), and depreciation, O M expense and return on rate base that are in excess of what is currently being recovered through rates (the last rate case plus authorized RAM adjustments and ARA revenues). 
 Regulatory proceedings. On December 23, 2020, the PBR D O was issued, establishing the PBR Framework. The PBR Framework implemented a five-year multi-year rate period (MRP), during which there will be no general rate case applications. In the fourth year of the MRP, the PUC will comprehensively review the PBR Framework to determine if any modifications or revisions are appropriate. See also Regulatory proceedings in Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Developments in renewable energy efforts . The Utilities renewable energy goals depend, in large part, on the success of renewable projects developed and operated by independent power producers. Beginning in 2017, the Utilities embarked on an ambitious procurement effort, selecting multiple solar plus storage projects to help reach the Utilities renewable portfolio standards goals as well as to assist the Utilities in retiring fossil fuel generation. Several of the recently procured projects have experienced delays as a result of supply chain disruptions caused by impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, solar product detentions at U.S. ports of entry ordered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, and unforeseen site conditions which resulted in unanticipated project costs or in some cases the inability to effectively use previously identified project sites. These impacts have resulted in five Stage 2 projects declared null and void by the independent power producers and one Stage 1 project and one Stage 2 project mutually terminating their PPAs with the Utilities. The Utilities have negotiated amendments with several project developers regarding requests to increase previously approved prices and extend guaranteed commercial operations dates for those projects in order to ensure their viability given the impact of these recent market conditions. All of these amendments have been approved. Significant project delays or failures of these projects increase the risk of the Utilities not meeting the renewable portfolio standards or other climate related goals, eligibility for performance incentive mechanisms associated with the speed of increasing renewable generation, and the ability to retire fossil fuel units. Developments in the Utilities efforts to further their renewable energy strategy include renewable energy projects discussed in Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the following: 
 New renewable PPAs . 
 On December 31, 2019, Hawaii Electric Light and Puna Geothermal Ventures entered into an Amended and Restated Power Purchase Agreement (PGV ARPPA). The PGV ARPPA extends the term of the existing PPA by 25 years to 2052, expands the firm capacity of the facility to 46 MW and delinks the pricing for energy delivered from the facility from fossil fuel prices to reduce cost to customers. On March 16, 2022, the PUC issued a D O, approving the PGV ARPPA, subject to conditions, that include requiring completion of a final environmental review prior to construction. On March 28, 2022, Puna Pono Alliance filed a Motion for Reconsideration seeking reconsideration, modification and/or vacation of the D O. On June 6, the PUC denied Puna Pono s Motion for Reconsideration. PGV notified the Utilities that changes in market conditions that transpired since the terms of the PGV ARPPA were negotiated impacted the financial viability of the Project, and that an amendment to the PGV ARPPA was necessary to mitigate the impacts. On March 27, 2023, the Utilities and PGV executed the First Amendment to the PGV ARPPA which increases the capacity payment and extends the GCOD. An application requesting approval of the First Amendment to the PGV ARPPA was filed on April 4, 2023. On June 13, 2023, PGV notified the Utilities of concerns of its ability to 
 91 

timely deliver on the terms of the ARPPA. PGV has been working to re-establish its capacity generation and has continued drilling and plans to drill additional wells, however, this process has taken longer than anticipated and PGV has become increasingly concerned about timely achieving the Contract Firm Capacity of 46 MW. In light of receiving this information and to allow the Utilities and PGV to determine the best path forward, on July 6, 2023 the Utilities asked the PUC to put the procedural schedule on hold for approval of the First Amendment to the PGV ARPPA. In order to address PGV s concerns, the parties executed a Second Amendment to the PGV ARPPA, which among other things lowered the capacity needed to reach commercial operations and preserves the full contract capacity, effectuating a partial commissioning. On October 2, 2023 the Utilities filed a letter requesting the docket be reopened and seeking approval of the First and Second Amendments to the PGV ARPPA by the end of 2023. On December 29, 2023, the PUC issued a D O conditionally approving the First and Second Amendments to the PGV ARPPA. As directed, on January 12, 2024, the Utilities filed a supplemental brief explaining their request for cost recovery. On September 30, 2024, the PUC approved the Utilities request for cost recovery. 
 Under a request for proposal process governed by the PUC and monitored by independent observers, in February 2018, the Utilities issued Stage 1 Renewable RFPs for 220 MW of renewable generation on Oahu, 50 MW of renewable generation on Hawaii Island, and 60 MW of renewable generation on Maui. To date, the Utilities filed seven requests with the PUC for approval of amendments related to previously-approved PPAs for changes in pricing and/or guaranteed commercial operations dates to support completion of the projects while maintaining system reliability. The PUC has approved all seven amendments. AES West Oahu Solar project on Oahu and AES Kuihelani Solar project on Maui reached commercial operations on March 28, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. See also Purchase commitments in Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. To date, five projects reached commercial operations. 
 A summary of the remaining seven PPAs is as follows: 
 Utilities Number of contracts Total photovoltaic size (MW) BESS Size (MW/MWh) Guaranteed commercial operation dates Contract term (years) Total projected annual payment (in millions) Hawaiian Electric 4 139.5 139.5/558 7/31/22, 1/11/23, 3/28/24 10/31/24

 Project delays have resulted in Guaranteed Commercial Operations Date being missed. 
 The Utilities have received PUC approvals to recover the total projected annual payment of 66.4 million for the seven PPAs through the PPAC to the extent such costs are not included in base rates. 
 In continuation of their February 2018 request for proposal process, the Utilities issued their Stage 2 Renewable RFPs for Oahu, Maui and Hawaii Island and Grid Services RFP on August 22, 2019. To date, the Utilities had filed 11 PPAs. Of the 11 filed PPAs, six PPAs were declared null and void by the independent power producers and one PPA was mutually terminated. The four remaining projects have received PUC approval. To date, the Utilities filed three requests with the PUC for approval of amendments related to previously-approved PPAs for changes in pricing and/or guaranteed commercial operations dates to support completion of the projects while maintaining system reliability. The PUC has approved all three amendments. The Kupono Solar project on Oahu reached commercial operations on June 7, 2024. See also Purchase commitments in Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. To date, two projects reached commercial operations. Additionally, two GSPAs and two applications for commitments of funds for capital expenditures for approval of the utility self-build projects were filed with the PUC. The two GSPAs were approved by the PUC in December 2020. As of September 30, 2024, the GSPA contracts have not yet achieved the contractual target. One of the aggregators has had financial difficulties where continuing the GSPA contract is now difficult. The Utilities are working towards planning and implementing an alternative solution for the two GSPA contracts.

 The utility Self-Build project was denied by the PUC on May 25, 2022 and the Utilities filed a motion for reconsideration with the PUC. On January 26, 2024, the PUC granted the Utilities November 15, 2023 request to suspend the docket to focus on identified priorities. The Utilities provided the PUC with an updated assessment of the project on April 30, 2024 and requested to withdraw the application because the need that was to be served by the project can now be met by Stage 3 RFP resources. On July 8, 2024, the Utilities received approval from the PUC to withdraw the project. 
 Tariffed renewable resources . 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were approximately 639 MW, 145 MW and 152 MW of installed distributed renewable energy technologies (mainly PV) at Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, respectively, for tariff-based private customer generation programs, namely Standard Interconnection Agreement, Net Energy Metering, Net Energy Metering Plus, Customer Grid Supply, Customer Self Supply, Customer Grid Supply Plus and Interim Smart Export. As of September 30, 2024, an estimated 43 of single family homes on the islands of Oahu, Hawaii and Maui have installed private rooftop solar systems, and approximately 24 of the Utilities total customers have solar systems. 
 The Utilities began accepting energy from feed-in tariff projects in 2011. As of September 30, 2024, there were 44 MW, 2 MW and 6 MW of installed feed-in tariff capacity from renewable energy technologies at Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, respectively. 
 Biofuel sources . 
 On August 23, 2024, the Utilities issued an RFP for biodiesel fuel supply commencing February 1, 2026. Proposals were due on September 30, 2024 and are currently being reviewed. 
 On June 30, 2021, the Utilities issued an RFP for all fuels, including biodiesel, for supply commencing January 1, 2023. The Utilities and Pacific Biodiesel Technologies, LLC (PBT) signed an agreement on December 13, 2021 for supply of biodiesel on all islands commencing January 1, 2023, which was approved by the PUC on December 1, 2022. Hawaiian Electric also has a spot buy contract with PBT to purchase additional quantities of biodiesel at or 
 93 

below the price of diesel. Some purchases of at parity biodiesel have been made under the spot purchase contract, which was extended through June 2025. 
 Hawaiian Electric has a contingency supply contract with REG Marketing Logistics Group, LLC to also supply biodiesel to any generating unit on Oahu in the event PBT is not able to supply necessary quantities. This contingency contract has been extended to November 2025, and will continue with no volume purchase requirements. 
 Requests for renewable proposals, expressions of interest, and information . 
 On November 22, 2021, CBRE RFPs for Molokai and Lanai were opened. The RFP for Lanai sought a single PV paired with storage project, which included a 3 MW portion, reserved for CBRE. The Lanai RFP closed on February 14, 2022 and the Molokai RFP closed on March 1, 2022. A project was selected in the Lanai RFP, but negotiations were terminated. On July 1, 2022, a replacement project was selected and negotiations commenced. The RFP for Molokai sought 2.75 MW of new PV paired with storage projects for CBRE generation. No projects were selected in the Molokai RFP. However, with the concurrence of the independent observer, the Utilities worked with the lone bidder outside of the RFP process and filed two PPAs with a total of 2.45 MW of PV paired with 11.1 MWh of battery energy storage on September 29, 2023.The PUC approved both PPAs on January 8, 2024. See Transition to a decarbonized and sustainable energy future Community-based renewable energy for additional information. 
 On March 17, 2022, the CBRE LMI RFPs for Oahu, Maui and Hawaii Island were opened and proposals were received. In November 2022, seven projects were selected consisting of one standalone PV project on Oahu, three paired PV with storage projects on Maui, and three paired PV with storage projects on Hawaii Island. One project on Maui was subsequently withdrawn by the developer on April 11, 2024. The Utilities opened the CBRE Tranche 1 RFPs for Oahu, Maui and Hawaii Island on April 14, 2022. In March 2023, five projects were selected consisting of one paired PV with storage project on Oahu and four standalone PV projects on Hawaii Island. Two projects on Hawaii Island were subsequently withdrawn by the developer on October 18, 2023 and an additional project on Oahu was subsequently withdrawn by the developer on June 14, 2024. Two projects on Hawaii Island were disqualified on May 13, 2024. See Transition to a decarbonized and sustainable energy future Community-based renewable energy for additional information. 
 The Hawaii Island Stage 3 RFP, seeking 325 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year of energy and 65 MW of renewable firm capacity, was issued on November 21, 2022. Proposals were received on April 20, 2023. The Stage 3 RFPs for Oahu and Maui opened for bids on January 20, 2023. For Oahu, the Utilities sought 500 to 700 MW of renewable firm capacity, and at least 965 GWh of renewable dispatchable energy annually. For Maui, the Utilities sought at least 40 MW of renewable firm capacity, and at least 425 GWh of renewable dispatchable energy annually. For the Oahu and Hawaii Island RFPs, as well as for the variable generation portion of the Maui RFP. Proposals for the firm generation portion of the Maui Stage 3 RFP were received on August 17, 2023, and Priority List selections were announced on October 9, 2023. 15 proposals were selected to the Final Award Group on December 8, 2023. Seven projects were selected on Oahu (three solar plus storage and four firm renewable) totaling 413 GWh of variable generation, 594 MW of firm generation, and 990 MWh of storage; four projects were selected on Maui (three solar plus storage and one wind) totaling 324 GWh of variable generation, and 320 MWh of storage; and four projects were selected on Hawaii Island (three solar plus storage and one firm renewable) totaling 512 GWh of variable generation, 60 MW of firm generation, and 834 MWh of storage. One project totaling 40 MW of firm renewable generation was selected to the Maui Firm Final Award Group on February 2, 2024. On May 24, 2024, a 20 MW / 80 MWh solar-plus storage project on Maui was withdrawn by the developer. On October 7, 2024, an 80 MW / 320 MWh solar-plus storage project on Oahu and two solar-plus storage projects on Hawaii Island totaling 115 MW / 460 MWh were withdrawn by the developer. Negotiations for the remaining projects are ongoing. 
 On August 19, 2024, the PUC opened a docket for the Utilities Integrated Grid Planning RFP (IGP RFP). On August 26, 2024, the Utilities filed their draft IGP RFP for Oahu and Hawaii Island. The Oahu portion of the IGP RFP seeks 589 GWh per year of energy and 270 MW of grid forming resources by December 2029, and 50 MW of renewable firm capacity by December 2032. The Hawaii Island portion of the IGP RFP seeks 134 GWh per year of energy by December 2029 and 60 MW of renewable firm capacity by December 2031. 
 Legislation and regulation. Congress and the Hawaii legislature periodically consider legislation that could have positive or negative effects on the Utilities and their customers. Also see Environmental regulation in Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Fuel contracts. On June 30, 2021, the Utilities issued two RFPs for all fuels for supply commencing January 1, 2023. On February 1, 2022, the Utilities and PAR Hawaii Refining, LLC (PAR Hawaii) entered into a fuel supply contract (Supply Agreement) commencing January 1, 2023. On December 1, 2022, the PUC issued a decision and order (D O) approving the PAR Hawaii fuels contract and recovery of associated costs through ECRC. On August 14, 2024, the Utilities entered into a 
 94 

second amendment of the Supply Agreement. The second amendment extends the term of the Supply Agreement by additional three years and create savings in fuel costs. The second amendment must be approved by the PUC to become effective. On August 23, 2024, the Utilities issued an RFP for biodiesel fuel supply commencing February 1, 2026. Proposals were due on September 30, 2024 and are currently being reviewed. 
 On March 3, 2022, as part of economic sanctions amid the Russia-Ukraine war, PAR Hawaii announced that it was suspending all purchases of Russian crude oil, which accounts for at least 25 of Hawaii s supply. The Utilities are taking additional measure to ensure adequate supply of fuel by entering into a backup fuel supply contract with Vitol Inc. (Vitol) commencing on December 1, 2022 through June 30, 2025 with annual extensions if mutually agreed by both parties. The PUC issued the final D O approving the Vitol backup fuels supply contract on December 1, 2022 and the costs incurred under the contract with Vitol are recovered in the Utilities respective ECRCs. 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Liquidity and capital resources. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Utilities accrued estimated wildfire liabilities of approximately 1.92 billion (pre-tax) related to the settlement of the Maui windstorm and wildfire tort-related legal claims (see Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Utilities incurred net losses of approximately 83 million and 1.27 billion, respectively. 
 When preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, management has the responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about HEI s and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. In making their evaluation, the Utilities consider, among other things, risks and/or uncertainties related to their results of operations, contractual obligations, including near-term debt maturities, dividend requirements, debt covenant compliance, or other factors impacting the Utilities liquidity and capital resources. 
 The Company previously concluded that as of June 30, 2024, conditions existed that raised substantial doubt about HEI s and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern, and that while HEI and the Utilities were working with their financial advisors on a financing plan to raise the capital necessary to mitigate those conditions, there was no assurance that management s plans would be successful. As a result, HEI and the Utilities disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2024 there was substantial doubt about HEI s and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern. 
 As a discussed in Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in the third quarter of 2024, after working with its financial advisors on various financing plans, the Company determined it would pay the proposed settlement in four equal annual installments. The Utilities revised their total settlement accrual to 1.92 billion, classifying the first 479 million installment as a current liability based on expected timing of the payment and the remaining 1.44 billion as a non-current liability on the Utilities Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. To finance the first installment payment, in September 2024, HEI completed the sale of 62.2 million shares of common stock in a registered offering, raising net proceeds of approximately 557.7 million. In addition, HEI filed with the SEC an at-the-market (ATM) offering program under which HEI may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, its common stock, without par value, having an aggregate offering price of up to 250 million. To date, HEI has not sold any common stock under this program. 
 Management believes that HEI s and the Utilities current cash balances, excluding ASB, as of September 30, 2024, amounting to 677.7 million and 147.6 million, respectively, the available capacity on Hawaiian Electric s ABL facility (see Note 6 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), the additional liquidity from HEI s recently registered ATM program, and expenditure reduction efforts, provide sufficient liquidity to alleviate the conditions that caused the substantial doubt about HEI s and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, HEI has agreed to transfer the amount of the first payment, 479 million, into a new subsidiary, which is restricted from disbursing such funds except in connection with the initial payments to the settlement funds. HEI expects to make this initial payment in late 2025 and HEI and the Utilities have sufficient resources to fund their operations and satisfy their other obligations for the next 12 months following the issuances of their financial statements. The plans that have been implemented have mitigated the conditions that previously caused the substantial doubt about HEI and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern as of the date of filing their 2024 second quarter financial statements. 
 HEI s and the Utilities future results of operations involve significant risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect HEI s and the Utilities future operating results and could cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, access to capital, ability to attract and retain key personnel, and pending or threatened litigation (including recent litigation noted above).

The Utilities future results of operations involve significant risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect the Utilities future operating results and could cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, access to capital, ability to attract and retain key personnel, and pending or threatened litigation (including recent litigation noted above). 
 As of September 30, 2024, Hawaiian Electric had no commercial paper outstanding, 200 million outstanding on its revolving credit facility and no remaining available borrowing capacity under the Utilities committed line of credit. The cash proceeds were invested in highly liquid short-term investments, and as of September 30, 2024, the Utilities cash and cash equivalents balance was 147.6 million, compared to 106.1 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Additionally, at September 30, 2024, Hawaii Electric had no borrowing from HEI with remaining available borrowing capacity of 75 million, pursuant to a standing commitment letter from HEI. See Note 6 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. At September 30, 2024, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric had short-term borrowings from Hawaiian Electric of nil and 46.2 million, respectively, which intercompany borrowings are eliminated in consolidation. 
 Hawaiian Electric s objective continues to be to operate a strong, financially healthy enterprise to empower a thriving future for Hawaii. While the fundamentals of their business remain strong, the Utilities took prudent and measured actions to strengthen their financial position while continuing to provide reliable service to their customers and reinforcing their commitment to serving the community for the long term. In August 2023, Hawaiian Electric fully drew down 200 million on its existing revolving credit facilities. The cash proceeds were primarily invested in highly liquid short-term investments and used for general corporate purposes. Longer term, the Utilities are evaluating other sources of liquidity that could include securitization, re-prioritizing capital spending and reducing O M, issuing secured debt, and conducting asset sales, among others. 
 Accounts receivable balances remain elevated coming out of the pandemic and has led to higher bad debt expense and higher write-offs in 2023 and year-to-date 2024, following the end of the moratorium on disconnections. The higher bad debt expense is expected to continue until the Utilities return to pre-pandemic accounts receivable balances, along with a decrease in volume, for delinquent accounts. The Maui windstorm and wildfires have not and are not anticipated to materially impact accounts receivable, however, it has and will continue to lead to higher bad debt expense. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 16.3 million of the Utilities accounts receivables were over 30 days past due, which is a decrease of approximately 26 since December 2023. In addition to the cash flow impact from delayed collection of accounts receivable, lower kWh sales relative to the level of kWh sales approved in the last rate case generally result in delayed timing of cash flows, resulting in higher working capital requirements. 
 With the exception of Maui, the Utilities are continuing the disconnection process on a tiered basis, expanding the targeted balances, which is expected to reduce delinquent accounts receivable balances and accelerate cash collections. Service disconnections on Maui have been suspended through December 7, 2024, in accordance with the extension of Governor Josh Green s emergency proclamation ; however, efforts are ongoing to educate and inform customers impacted by the Maui windstorm and wildfires on the availability of financial assistance to manage delinquencies accordingly. See also Regulatory assets and liabilities in Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The rebuilding of Lahaina will be a community-led effort and will occur over an extended period of time. The cost of rebuilding the electric utility infrastructure is not yet known, but could be significant because the infrastructure that may be required is expected to be different than what previously existed. For example, to mitigate wildfire risk, grid hardening strategies, such as undergrounding of lines in high-risk locations will be significantly more expensive than using overhead lines and will thus result in increased costs. 
 Hawaiian Electric s consolidated capital structure was as follows: (dollars in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Long-term debt, net 1,935 63 1,934 44 Preferred stock 34 1 34 1 Common stock equity 1,110 36 2,409 55 3,079 100 4,377 100 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Utilities are in compliance with all applicable financial covenants. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Utilities accrued liabilities related to wildfire tort-related claims totaling 1.92 billion. As a result, as of September 30, 2024, the amount of additional debt that the Utilities could incur will be temporarily limited to approximately 90 million due to certain financial covenants. The amount of additional debt that could be incurred by the Utilities will increase over time as earnings are generated or when HEI contributes equity related to the settlement payments or for capital expenditures. The Utilities believe that with the cash on hand, availability on the ABL facility, and potential equity 
 96 

contributions from HEI, they have sufficient financial flexibility to continue to be in compliance with all the financial covenants in the next 12 months. However, the Utilities cannot predict the future effects on the Utilities ability to access additional capital or the future impacts on the Utilities financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Prior to the Maui windstorm and wildfires, Hawaiian Electric utilized short-term debt, typically commercial paper, to support normal operations, to refinance short-term debt and for other temporary requirements. Hawaiian Electric may also borrow short-term from HEI for itself and on behalf of Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, and Hawaiian Electric may borrow from or loan to Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric on a short-term basis. The intercompany borrowings among the Utilities, but not the borrowings from HEI, are eliminated in the consolidation of Hawaiian Electric s financial statements. The Utilities also historically utilized long-term debt, borrowings of the proceeds of special purpose revenue bonds (SPRBs) issued by the State of Hawaii Department of Budget and Finance (DBF) and the issuance of privately placed unsecured senior notes bearing taxable interest, to finance the Utilities capital improvement projects, or to repay short-term borrowings used to finance such projects. The downgrades of Hawaiian Electric s credit ratings will continue to adversely impact the Utilities ability to access capital markets and other sources of debt and equity financing, if at all, in a timely manner and on acceptable terms. 
 Credit ratings . On August 26, 2024, S P revised Hawaiian Electric s outlook to Watch Negative from Negative and affirmed the B- issuer credit rating. On October 25, 2024, Fitch revised Hawaiian Electric s outlook to Stable from Watch Negative and affirmed the B issuer credit rating. 
 See Credit and Capital Market Risk in Item 1A. Risk Factors in HEI s and Hawaiian Electric s 2023 Form 10-K. The downgrades of Hawaiian Electric s credit ratings will continue to adversely impact the Utilities ability to access capital markets and other sources of debt financing, if at all, in a timely manner and on acceptable terms. In addition, the downgrades of Hawaiian Electric s credit ratings triggered certain cash or payment requirements with the Utilities vendors. However, the Utilities believe additional vendor collateral or payment requirements will not have a material impact on the Utilities liquidity. 
 Asset-based lending facility credit agreement . On May 17, 2024, Hawaiian Electric, through a special-purpose subsidiary, entered into an asset-based lending facility (ABL Facility) credit agreement (ABL Credit Facility Agreement) with several banks, which, subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in such agreement, including approval by the PUC, allows borrowings of up to 250 million on a revolving basis using certain accounts receivable as collateral. Hawaiian Electric filed an application with the PUC for approval to (i) sell accounts receivable, and (ii) establish a long-term credit facility. The first approval would allow the ABL Credit Facility Agreement to become effective for 364 days and the second approval would extend the term of the ABL Credit Facility Agreement from 364 days to three years. The ABL Credit Facility Agreement has an initial term of 364 days, with an automatic extension to three years upon receipt of the second PUC approval, with three separate options to extend one additional year, subject to the consent of the lenders. Hawaiian Electric received the first and second approvals from the PUC for the ABL Credit Facility Agreement that allows short-term and long-term borrowings of up to 250 million on June 27, 2024 and October 11, 2024, respectively, subject to the availability of a sufficient borrowing base of eligible receivables. The ABL Facility became effective on July 24, 2024. The ABL Facility remains undrawn as of September 30, 2024; however, the amount that could be drawn is temporarily limited due to the accrual of the wildfire tort-related claims, which reduces the amount of additional debt that could be incurred before exceeding certain financial covenants. The amount that could be drawn as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 90 million and will increase over time as earnings are generated and when HEI contributes equity related to the settlement payments or for capital expenditures. 
 Credit agreement . On August 23, 2023, Hawaiian Electric fully drew down 200 million on its existing revolving credit facilities. The cash proceeds were invested in highly liquid short-term investments and will be used for general corporate purposes. The 200 million line of credit facility remained fully drawn as of September 30, 2024. See Note 6 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 SPRBs . Special purpose revenue bonds (SPRBs) have been issued by the Department of Budget and Finance of the State of Hawaii (DBF) to finance (and refinance) capital improvement projects of Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries, but the sources of their repayment are the non-collateralized obligations of Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries under loan agreements and notes issued to the DBF, including Hawaiian Electric s guarantees of its subsidiaries obligations. 
 On June 10, 2019, the Hawaii legislature authorized the issuance of up to 700 million of SPRBs 400 million for Hawaiian Electric, 150 million for Hawaii Electric Light and 150 million for Maui Electric), with PUC approval, prior to June 30, 2024, to finance the Utilities multi-project capital improvement programs (2019 Legislative Authorization). The Utilities did not issue SPRBs under the 2019 Legislative Authorization which lapsed on June 30, 2024. 
 Taxable debt . On December 20, 2022, the Utilities received PUC approval to issue, over a four-year period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2026, unsecured obligations bearing taxable interest (Hawaiian Electric up to 230 million, Hawaii Electric Light up to 65 million and Maui Electric up to 105 million), to finance capital expenditures, repay long-term and/or short-term debt used to finance or refinance capital expenditures, and/or to reimburse funds used for payment of capital 
 97 

expenditures. Pursuant to the approval, on January 10, 2023, the Utilities executed through a private placement, 150 million in unsecured senior notes (2023 Notes). The 2023 Notes had a delayed draw feature and the Utilities drew down all the proceeds on February 9, 2023. See summary table below for remaining authorized amounts as of September 30, 2024 for each respective utility. 
 (in millions) Hawaiian Electric Hawaii Electric Light Maui Electric Total up to amounts of taxable debt authorized from 2023 through 2026 230 65 105 Less: taxable debt executed on January 10, 2023, but issued on February 9, 2023 
 100 25 25 Remaining authorized amounts 130 40 80 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Utilities have 1.9 billion of long-term debt, net, of which 47.0 million and 145.3 million are due within 12 and 24 months, respectively. 
 Equity . On December 20, 2022, the Utilities received PUC approval to issue and sell each utility s common stock over a four-year period from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2026 (Hawaiian Electric s sale/s to HEI of up to 75 million, Hawaii Electric Light sale/s to Hawaiian Electric of up to 25 million, and Maui Electric sale/s to Hawaiian Electric of up to 55 million) and the purchase of Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric common stock by Hawaiian Electric from 2023 through December 31, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light, and Maui Electric have 75 million, 25 million, and nil, respectively, of unused common stock authorization. 
 Cash flows . The following table reflects the changes in cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023: Nine months ended September 30 (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by operating activities 322,648 406,111 (83,463) Net cash used in investing activities (241,603) (329,281) 87,678 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
 (39,498) 160,782 (200,280) 
 Net cash provided by operating activities. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher vendor payments, higher income taxes paid, partially offset by higher insurance proceeds received in 2024. 
 Net cash used in investing activities. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a decrease in capital expenditures related to construction activities. 
 Net cash used in financing activities . The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was driven by lower net cash from long-term and short-term borrowings due to fully drawing on the 200 million revolving credit facilities in August 2023. 
 For a discussion of 2023 operating, investing and financing activities, please refer to the Liquidity and capital resources section in Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Electric utility, in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Material cash requirements . Material cash requirements of the Utilities include payments related to settlement of tort-related legal claims and cross claims, legal and consulting costs related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires (see further information in Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), O M expenses, labor and benefit costs, fuel and purchase power costs, debt and interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, their forecasted capital expenditures (including capital expenditures related to wildfires and wildfire mitigations) and investments, their expected retirement benefit plan contributions and other short-term and long-term material cash requirements. The cash requirements for O M, fuel and purchase power costs, debt and interest payments, and operating and finance lease obligations are generally funded through the collection of the Utilities revenue requirement established in the last rate case and other mechanisms established under the regulatory framework. The cash requirements for capital expenditures are generally funded through operating cash flows, the issuance of debt, and contributions of equity from HEI and generally recovered through the Utilities revenue requirement or other capital recovery mechanisms over time. 
 The Utilities credit rating downgrades related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires will continue to adversely impact their ability to access capital markets and other sources of debt and equity financing, if at all, in a timely manner and on acceptable terms. Through the sale of common stock in September 2024, the Company has raised sufficient cash to pay the first installment of the settlement of wildfire tort claims expected to be made in late 2025. The Company is currently working with its financial advisors on a financing plan to raise the additional capital required to fund their remaining wildfire tort claims. While management believes that the Company will be able to raise the necessary capital, there is no assurance that management s plans will be successful. The potential damages and losses related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires and related lawsuits (see 
 98 

further information in Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), the economic impact of higher fuel prices, inflation, higher interest rates, tightening of monetary policy, and geopolitical situations, create significant uncertainty, and the Utilities cannot predict the extent or duration of these conditions, the future effects that these conditions will have on the Utilities financing plan, cost of capital and their ability to access additional capital, or the future impacts on the Utilities financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

 Recent Developments. See also Recent developments in HEI s MD A. 
 In June 2024, ASB recorded a pretax goodwill impairment charge of 82.2 million after determining it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of ASB was less than its carrying value. The impairment charge was non-cash in nature and did not affect the Company s current liquidity, cash flows or any debt covenants under the Company s existing credit agreements. See Goodwill in Note 5 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. 
 In August 2023, ASB was impacted by wildfires on Maui which caused widespread property damage and fatalities. ASB s outstanding credit exposure in Maui and the fire impacted zone of Lahaina as of September 30, 2024 was 12.3 and 0.6 , respectively, of the Bank s total loan portfolio. 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, ASB incurred additional expenses as a result of the Maui wildfires of 0.9 million, pretax, primarily consisting of professional services, partially offset by negative provision for credit losses of 0.2 million. 
 The Hawaii economy remained stable in the third quarter of 2024 with average daily passenger counts 3.9 higher than the comparable period in the prior year. The recovery in total passenger counts from the low levels in 2020 is largely due to domestic travelers. International visitors (excluding Japan) have gradually increased although still below pre-pandemic levels. The weak yen continues to be a key contributing factor to the low Japan visitor counts as compared to other international visitors. Hawaii s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 2.9 in September 2024 was slightly lower compared to the September 2023 rate of 3.0 . Despite higher interest rates, Hawaii s real estate market, as indicated by Oahu s residential real estate market, has remained relatively stable. Single-family home sales grew 5.8 through September 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, while condo sales declined 5.6 . 
 At its September 18, 2024 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower the federal funds rate target range by 1/2 percentage point to 4.75 - 5.0 reflecting its confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. The interest rate environment has impacted ASB s net interest margin as higher yields on earning assets were offset by an increase in yields on deposits and other borrowings. The higher interest rate environment has also reduced mortgage refinance and purchase activity, negatively impacting mortgage banking income. Additionally, the tight labor market and inflationary pressures have increased compensation and benefit expenses. 
 ASB s loan portfolio decreased 146 million in 2024 as compared to the end of 2023 primarily due to payoffs and sale of commercial loans as well as reduced demand for home equity line of credit and consumer loan products. 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, ASB recorded a provision for credit losses of 0.2 million primarily based on strong credit quality of the loan portfolio, the healthy Hawaii economy, lower loan portfolio balances and the release of 0.2 million of credit loss reserves for loans that were impacted by Maui wildfires. The provision for credit losses in future quarters will be dependent on future economic conditions and changes to borrower credit quality at that time. 
 At September 30, 2024, the investment securities portfolio balance decreased approximately 94 million from year end 2023 due to repayments and no purchases of investment securities in 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, ASB s regulatory capital ratios were above the well-capitalized and regulatory requirements, including the conservation buffers. Approximately 83 of the Bank s deposits are FDIC insured or fully collateralized. ASB has access to approximately 3.1 billion in funding sources to meet its liquidity needs. 
 ASB continues to maintain its low-risk profile, strong balance sheet and straightforward community banking business model.

 Provision for credit losses 9 (9) No provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects strong credit quality, the healthy Hawaii economy, lower loan portfolio balances as well as the reversal of 0.2 million credit loss reserves for loans impacted by the Maui wildfires. 
 Delinquency rates have increased from 0.24 at September 30, 2023 to 0.47 at September 30, 2024 primarily due to Maui-related loan accommodations and one commercial real estate loan in foreclosure. 
 Net charge-off to average loans increased 8 basis points from 0.07 at September 30, 2023 to 0.15 at September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in consumer loan net charge-offs. 
 Noninterest expense 56 56 Expenses 81 88 (7) The decrease in expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was due to a decrease in provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in interest expense. 
 Operating income 
 24 13 11 The increase in operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to lower provision for credit losses, higher interest and dividend income and higher noninterest income, partially offset by higher interest expense. 
 Net income 
 19 11 8 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher as compared to the same period in 2023 due to higher operating income.

 Average loan portfolio balances decreased 3 million commercial, home equity line of credit and consumer loan portfolio average balances decreased 85 million, 41 million and 24 million, respectively, due to payoffs and decreased demand for these loan products. Residential and commercial real estate loan average balances increased 87 million and 61 million, respectively. 
 Average investment securities portfolio balances decreased 388 million primarily due to repayments, no purchases in 2024 and sale of investment securities in the quarter ended December 31, 2023. 
 Average investment securities portfolio yields decreased 5 basis points. 
 Noninterest income 50 45 5 Higher bank-owned life insurance income higher returns from insurance policies. 
 Higher fee income from other financial products - higher revenues from Investment Services. 
 Revenues 312 292 20 The increase in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to higher interest and dividend income and higher noninterest income. 
 Interest expense 76 56 20 Increase in interest expense due to an increase in core deposit and term certificate yields, partially offset by lower other borrowing balances. 
 Average core deposit balances decreased 375 million; average term certificate balances increased 226 million. 
 Average deposit yields increased from 51 to 91 basis points primarily due to the increase in term certificate yields of 52 basis points and the shift in mix of deposits from low cost core deposits to term certificates. 
 Average other borrowings decreased 172 million and average yields increased 29 basis points. 
 Provision for credit losses (4) 10 (14) 2024 negative provision for credit losses included reversal of 2.5 million credit loss reserves for loans impacted by the Maui wildfires, improving loan loss rates and lower loan portfolio balances. 
 2024 negative provision for credit losses also included the release of 0.9 million of credit loss reserves for unfunded loan commitments. 
 Delinquency rates have increased from 0.24 at September 30, 2023 to 0.47 at September 30, 2024 primarily due to Maui-related loan accommodations and one commercial real estate loan in foreclosure. 
 Net charge-off to average loans increased 4 basis points from 0.11 as of September 30, 2023 to 0.15 at September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in consumer loan net charge-offs. 
 Noninterest expense 248 165 83 The increase in noninterest expenses was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of 82.2 million as a result of HEI s comprehensive review of strategic options for ASB, expenses related to the Maui wildfires and higher compensation and benefits expenses. 
 Expenses 320 231 89 The increase in expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was due to higher noninterest expense and interest expense, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. 
 Operating income (loss) 
 (8) 61 (69) The decrease in operating income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to higher noninterest expense and interest expense, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income, lower provision for credit losses and higher noninterest income.

Includes nonaccrual loans. 
 3 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the taxable-equivalent basis adjustments made to the table above were not material. 
 4 Defined as net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets. 
 Earning assets, costing liabilities, contingencies and other factors. Earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on costing liabilities. At its September 18, 2024 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower the federal funds rate target range by 1/2 
 105 

percentage point to 4.75 - 5.0 . ASB s net interest income and net interest margin has been impacted by the higher interest rates as the Bank has used higher costing other borrowings and term certificates to fund its loan growth. 
 Loans and mortgage-backed securities are ASB s primary earning assets. 
 Loan portfolio . ASB s loan volumes and yields are affected by market interest rates, competition, demand for financing, availability of funds and management s responses to these factors. See Note 5 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a composition of ASB s loan portfolio. 
 Home equity key credit statistics . The home equity line of credit (HELOC) portfolio makes up 16 of the total loan portfolio and is generally an interest-only revolving loan for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC outstanding balance converts to a fully amortizing variable-rate term loan with a 20-year amortization period. Borrowers also have a Fixed Rate Loan Option to convert a part of their available line of credit into a 5, 7 or 10-year fully amortizing fixed-rate loan with level principal and interest payments. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 36 of the portfolio balances were amortizing loans under the Fixed Rate Loan Option. A HELOC loan is typically in a subordinate lien position to a borrower s first mortgage loan, however, approximately 51 of ASB s HELOC loan portfolio is in a first lien position. 
 Loan portfolio risk elements . See Note 5 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Investment securities . ASB s investment portfolio was comprised as follows: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Balance of total Balance of total U.S. Treasury and federal agency obligations 67,532 3 71,927 3 Mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies or sponsored agencies 2,127,921 95 2,218,565 95 Corporate bonds 33,924 1 32,903 1 Mortgage revenue bonds 13,935 1 14,358 1 Total investment securities 2,243,312 100 2,337,753 100 
 Currently, ASB s investment portfolio consists of U.S. Treasury and federal agency obligations, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and mortgage revenue bonds. ASB owns mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government agencies or sponsored agencies, including the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and Small Business Administration (SBA). Principal and interest on mortgage-backed securities issued by FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA and SBA are guaranteed by the issuer and, in the case of GNMA and SBA, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. U.S. Treasury securities are also backed by the full faith of the U.S. government. 
 Deposits and other borrowings . Deposits continue to be the largest source of funds for ASB and are affected by market interest rates, competition and management s responses to these factors. In 2024, deposits decreased by 147 million due to an outflow of core deposits and reduction of public certificates of deposits, partially offset by an increase in time certificates. Core deposit retention will remain challenging in the current interest rate environment. Advances from the FHLB of Des Moines, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank and federal funds purchased continue to be additional sources of funds. As of September 30, 2024, ASB s costing liabilities consisted of 94 deposits and 6 borrowings as compared to 92 deposits and 8 borrowings as of December 31, 2023. The weighted average cost of interest-bearing deposits for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 1.32 and 0.76 , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ASB had approximately 1.7 billion and 1.6 billion of deposits that were uninsured or not collateralized, respectively. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines and Federal Reserve Bank . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ASB had 520 million and 200 million of advances outstanding at the FHLB of Des Moines, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the unused borrowing capacity with the FHLB of Des Moines was 1.5 billion. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ASB had nil and 550 million of borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank, respectively. The FHLB of Des Moines and Federal Reserve Bank are important sources of liquidity for ASB. 
 Contingencies . ASB is subject in the normal course of business to pending and threatened legal proceedings. Management does not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of these pending or threatened legal proceedings will be material to its financial position. However, ASB cannot rule out the possibility that such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or liquidity for a particular reporting period in the future. 
 Other factors . Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB s operations and also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASB s investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into 
 106 

decreases and increases in the fair value of the investment securities, respectively. In addition, changes in credit spreads also impact the fair values of the investment securities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, ASB had an unrealized loss, net of taxes, on available-for-sale investment securities in AOCI of 128.9 million compared to an unrealized loss, net of taxes, of 150.4 million as of December 31, 2023. See Item 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of ASB s interest rate risk sensitivity. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, ASB recorded a negative provision for credit losses of 2.9 million in the allowance for credit losses primarily due to the release of 2.5 million of credit loss reserves related to the Maui wildfires, improving credit loss rates and lower loan balances. During the first nine months of 2023, ASB recorded a provision for credit losses of 9.4 million in the allowance for credit losses for growth in the loan portfolio, credit loss reserves related to the Maui wildfires and additional credit loss reserves to cover net charge-offs, partly offset by the release of credit loss reserves for improved credit trends and lower credit loss rates. Nine months ended September 30 Year ended

 ASB maintains a reserve for credit losses that consists of two components, the allowance for credit losses and an allowance for loan commitments (unfunded reserve). The level of the reserve for unfunded loan commitments is adjusted by recording an expense or recovery in provision for credit losses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, ASB recorded a negative provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments of 0.9 million as compared to a provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments of 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the reserve for unfunded loan commitments was 4.2 million and 5.1 million, respectively. 
 Legislation and regulation. ASB is subject to extensive regulation, principally by the OCC and the FDIC. Depending on ASB s level of regulatory capital and other considerations, these regulations could restrict the ability of ASB to compete with other institutions and to pay dividends to its shareholder. See the discussion below under Liquidity and capital resources.

 As of September 30, 2024, ASB was one of Hawaii s largest financial institutions based on assets of 9.3 billion and deposits of 8.0 billion. 
 As of September 30, 2024, ASB s unused FHLB borrowing capacity was approximately 1.5 billion. As of September 30, 2024, ASB had commitments to borrowers for loans and unused lines and letters of credit of 1.8 billion, of which, commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loan terms have been modified were nil. Management believes ASB s current sources of funds will enable it to meet these obligations while maintaining liquidity at satisfactory levels. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by ASB s operating activities was 49 million. Net cash provided by ASB s investing activities during the same period was 231 million, primarily due to the receipt of investment security repayments and maturities of 133 million, a net decrease in loans receivable of 111 million and proceeds from the sale of commercial loans of 40 million partly offset by contributions to low income housing investments of 34 million and a net increase in FHLB stock of 14 million. Net cash used in financing activities during this period was 382 million, primarily 
 107 

due to a net decrease in other borrowings of 230 million, a decrease in deposit liabilities of 147 million and a net decrease in mortgage escrow deposits of 6 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by ASB s operating activities was 80 million. Net cash used during the same period by ASB s investing activities was 38 million, primarily due to a net increase in loans receivable of 283 million, purchases of loans held for investment of 26 million and additions to premises and equipment of 5 million, partly offset by the receipt of investment security repayments and maturities of 170 million, proceeds from the sale of commercial loans of 95 million, a net decrease in FHLB stock of 9 million and proceeds from the redemption of bank owned life insurance of 3 million. Net cash provided by financing activities during this period was 65 million, primarily due to a net increase in other borrowings of 336 million, partly offset by a net decrease in repurchase agreements of 183 million, decreases in deposit liabilities of 44 million, a net decrease in mortgage escrow deposits of 5 million and 39 million in common stock dividends to HEI (through ASB Hawaii). 
 ASB believes that maintaining a satisfactory regulatory capital position provides a basis for public confidence, affords protection to depositors, helps to ensure continued access to capital markets on favorable terms and provides a foundation for growth. FDIC regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that are not well-capitalized to compete on the same terms as well-capitalized institutions, such as by offering interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions. As of September 30, 2024, ASB was well-capitalized (well-capitalized ratio requirements noted in parentheses) with a Tier-1 leverage ratio of 8.6 (5.0 ), common equity Tier-1 ratio of 13.5 (6.5 ), Tier-1 capital ratio of 13.5 (8.0 and total capital ratio of 14.6 (10.0 ). As of December 31, 2023, ASB was well-capitalized (well-capitalized ratio requirements noted in parentheses) with a Tier-1 leverage ratio of 7.7 (5.0 ), common equity Tier-1 ratio of 12.3 (6.5 ), Tier-1 capital ratio of 12.3 (8.0 and total capital ratio of 13.4 (10.0 ). All dividends are subject to review by the OCC and FRB and receipt of a letter from the FRB communicating the agencies non-objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to HEI (through ASB Hawaii). As of September 30, 2024, ASB did not request a dividend distribution from the OCC and FRB and will reevaluate its ability to distribute excess capital next quarter.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company considers interest-rate risk (a non-trading market risk) to be a significant market risk for ASB as it could potentially have material impacts on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For additional quantitative and qualitative information about the Company s market risks, see HEI s and Hawaiian Electric s Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A of HEI s 2023 Form 10-K (pages 81 to 83). 
 ASB s interest-rate risk sensitivity measures as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 constitute forward-looking statements and were as follows: Change in interest rates Change in NII (gradual change in interest rates) Change in EVE (instantaneous change in interest rates) (basis points) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 +300 (0.9 2.1 1.6 2.7 +200 (0.6) 1.4 1.7 2.5 +100 (0.3) 0.7 1.3 1.7 -100 (0.1) (1.0) (2.2) (2.3) -200 (0.3) (2.2) (5.2) (5.4) -300 (0.8) (3.5) (10.2) (10.3) 
 ASB s net interest income (NII) sensitivity profile shifted to a more neutral position as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 primarily driven by lower cash balances and higher rate sensitive deposit balances. 
 Economic value of equity (EVE) sensitivity decreased as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 due to lower core deposit duration, partially offset by decrease in duration of mortgage-related investments and loans. 
 
 The computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes on the NII sensitivity and the percentage change in EVE is based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments, balance changes and pricing strategies, and should not be relied upon as indications of actual results. To the extent market conditions and other factors vary from the assumptions used in the simulation analysis, actual results may differ materially from the simulation results. NII sensitivity analysis measures the change in ASB s twelve-month, pretax NII in alternate interest rate scenarios, and is intended to help management identify potential exposures in ASB s current balance sheet and formulate appropriate strategies for managing interest rate risk. The simulation does not contemplate any actions that ASB management might undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Further, the changes in NII vary in the twelve-month simulation period and are not necessarily evenly distributed over the period. These analyses are for analytical purposes only and do not represent management s views of future market movements, the level of future earnings or the timing of any changes in earnings within the twelve month analysis horizon. The actual impact of changes in interest rates on NII will depend on the magnitude and speed with which rates change, actual changes in ASB s balance sheet and management s responses to the changes in interest rates.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The descriptions of legal proceedings (including judicial proceedings and proceedings before the PUC and environmental and other administrative agencies) in HEI s and Hawaiian Electric s 2023 Form 10-K (see Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings and proceedings referred to therein) and this Form 10-Q (see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 2, 4 and 5 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) are incorporated by reference in this Item 1. With regard to any pending legal proceeding, alternative dispute resolution, such as mediation or settlement, may be pursued where appropriate, with such efforts typically maintained in confidence unless and until a resolution is achieved. Certain HEI subsidiaries (including Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries, ASB and Pacific Current and its subsidiaries) may also be involved in ordinary routine PUC proceedings, environmental proceedings and litigation incidental to their respective businesses. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 For information about Risk Factors, see pages 20 to 33 of HEI s and Hawaiian Electric s 2023 Form 10-K and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Also, see Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements on pages iv through vi herein and as supplemented below. 
 There may be future conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and it is possible that any plan developed to alleviate such doubt may be unsuccessful. In addition, any capital raised may result in dilution to our current shareholders. 
 As described more fully in Note 1 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred net losses of approximately 104 million and 1.36 billion, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Utilities incurred net losses of approximately 83 million and 1.27 billion, respectively. The net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to the accruals of estimated wildfire liabilities in the second and third quarters of 2024, totaling approximately 1.92 billion related to the Maui windstorm and wildfire tort-related legal claims. The Company previously disclosed in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2024, that based on its financial and liquidity condition, and because it had not yet implemented a capital financing plan to address proposed wildfire settlement payments, there was substantial doubt about HEI s and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Management believes that HEI s and the Utilities current cash balances, excluding ASB, as of September 30, 2024, amounting to 677.7 million and 147.6 million, respectively, the available capacity on Hawaiian Electric s ABL facility (see Note 6 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), the additional liquidity from HEI s recently registered ATM program, and expenditure reduction efforts, provide sufficient liquidity to alleviate the conditions that caused the substantial doubt about HEI s and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, HEI has agreed to transfer the amount of the first payment, 479 million, into a new subsidiary, which is restricted from disbursing such funds except in connection with the initial payments to the settlement funds. HEI expects to make this initial payment in late 2025 and HEI and the Utilities have sufficient resources to fund their operations and satisfy their other obligations for the next 12 months following the issuances of their financial statements. The plans that have been implemented have mitigated the conditions that previously caused the substantial doubt about HEI and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern as of the date of filing their 2024 second quarter financial statements. Although the Company has raised sufficient cash to pay the first installment of the settlement of wildfire tort claims, the Company is currently working with its financial advisors on a financing plan to raise the additional capital necessary to fund the remaining payment installments of the settlement of wildfire tort claims. There is no assurance that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts on a timely basis or on reasonable terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we raise funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, our shareholders may experience dilution. While management believes the Company will be able to raise the necessary capital, there is no assurance that management s plans will be successful. 
 The recurrence of any substantial doubt about HEI s and the Utilities ability to continue as a going concern may affect the price of our common stock, may impact our relationship with third parties with whom we do business, including our vendors, lenders and employees, may impact our ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt and may impact our ability to comply, going forward, with certain covenants in our debt agreements and/or satisfy conditions to draw thereunder, which could significantly and materially restrict our operations. 
 If a court-approved definitive settlement agreement to resolve Maui windstorm and wildfire tort-related legal claims is not obtained, or if financing for settlement payments is not available, we may need to consider other alternatives for addressing the 
 111 

outstanding legal claims or settlement payments, and such alternatives could adversely affect our financial results or other factors impacting our finances, operations or stock valuation. 
 As described more fully in Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, the Company entered into Settlement Agreements effective November 1, 2024, to resolve all Maui windstorm and wildfire tort-related legal claims, including all claims among the defendants. Such Settlement Agreements are subject to court approval, and other conditions including resolution of the claims of the insurance companies that have paid claims for property loss and other damages. If all conditions of the Settlement Agreements are satisfied, the Company has agreed to make substantial payments to settle all Maui windstorm and wildfire tort-related legal claims. As described more fully in Note 2 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, if the conditions of the Settlement Agreements are not satisfied or the agreements are otherwise terminated, the Company intends to vigorously defend against the litigation. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in the defense of the litigation or that insurance proceeds will be available to fund any potential settlements, judgments, or costs associated with the litigation. 
 If all conditions of the Settlement Agreements are satisfied, the Company expects to finance the settlement payments through a mix of debt, common equity, equity-linked securities or other potential options. While management believes the Company will be able to raise the capital necessary to finance the settlement payments, there is no assurance that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts, on a timely basis or on reasonable terms acceptable to us, if at all. 
 If the Company s financing plans are unsuccessful, we may need to consider other strategic alternatives, including delaying strategic initiatives, selling assets, or other strategic measures including, without limitation, obtaining relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Such alternatives could adversely affect our financial results or other factors impacting our finances, operations or stock valuation.
