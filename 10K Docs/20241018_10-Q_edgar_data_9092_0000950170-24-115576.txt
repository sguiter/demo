Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND OVERVIEW 
 With more than a century of water technology innovation, Badger Meter is a global provider of industry leading water management solutions, with nearly 95 of net sales derived from water-related applications. These tailorable solutions encompass smart measurement hardware, reliable communications, data and analytics software as well as ongoing support and expertise essential to optimize customers' operations and contribute to the sustainable use and protection of the world s most precious resource. 
 
 The Company s smart measurement hardware is primarily comprised of the following product families: 
 
 	meters that measure the flow of water and other fluids and are known for accuracy, long-lasting durability and for providing valuable and timely flow measurement data. 
 
 	water quality monitoring solutions, including optical sensing and electrochemical instruments that provide real-time, on-demand data parameters. 
 
 	high frequency pressure and acoustic leak detection hardware that provides real-time monitoring data. 
 
 The Company s broad range of communication solutions include the ORION branded family of radio endpoints, providing customers with a choice of industry-leading options for communicating data from hardware into usable applications. 
 
 The Company s hardware-enabled software provides the insights and analytics critical to the holistic management of our customers water systems. These digital solutions increase visibility, empowering customers to monitor system performance and make decisions aiding efficiency, resiliency, and sustainability. 
 
 The Company also provides training, project management, technical support and other collaborative services for customers. 
 
 The Company s solutions fall into two product lines: sales of meters, water quality sensors and other hardware, communication, and software and related technologies, to water utilities (utility water) and sales of meters, other sensing instruments, valves, software and other solutions to commercial and industrial customers, including water related applications (flow instrumentation). 
 
 Utility Water Product Line (approximately 85 of Net Sales in fiscal 2023) 
 Utility water smart metering solutions are comprised of water meters along with the related radio and software technologies and services used by water utilities as the basis for generating their water and wastewater revenues, enabling operating efficiencies and engaging with their end consumers. This product line further comprises other instruments and sensors used in the water distribution system to ensure the safe and efficient delivery of clean water. These sensors are used to detect leaks and to monitor various water quality parameters throughout the distribution system. The largest geographic market in which the Company operates is North America, primarily the United States. The majority of water meters sold are mechanical in nature, with increasing adoption over time of ultrasonic (static) metering technology due to a variety of attributes, including their ability to maintain measurement accuracy over their useful life. 
 Utility water meters (both residential and commercial sizes) are generally classified as either manually read meters or remotely read meters via radio technology. A manually read meter consists of a water meter and a register that provides a visual totalized meter reading. Meters equipped with radio technology (endpoints) receive flow measurement data from battery-powered encoder registers attached to the water meter, which is encrypted and transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility usage and billing systems. These remotely read systems are classified as either automatic meter reading (AMR) systems, where a vehicle equipped for meter reading purposes collects the data from the utilities meters, or advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems, where data is gathered utilizing a network (either fixed or cellular) of data collectors or gateway receivers that are able to receive radio data transmission from the utilities meters. Among other benefits, AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to drive through service territories to collect data from the meters and provide utilities with more frequent and diverse data from their meters at specified intervals. 
 The ORION family of endpoints offers water utilities a choice of industry-leading options for communicating meter reading and event data. ORION Cellular endpoints power our Network as a Service (NaaS) approach to AMI, eliminating the 
 15 

Table of Contents 

need for the utility to install or maintain infrastructure, enabling rapid or gradual deployment, and enhancing network reliability. ORION mobile read endpoints support customers looking to deploy an AMR solution. 
 Information and analytics are critical to the smart water ecosystem. The Company s BEACON SaaS, amongst others, improves utility visibility to their water and water usage. BEACON is a secure, cloud-hosted software suite that includes a customizable dashboard and has the ability to establish alerts for specific conditions. It also allows for consumer engagement tools that permit end water users (such as homeowners) to view and manage their water usage activity. Benefits to the utility include improved customer service, increased visibility through faster leak detection, the ability to promote and quantify the effects of its water conservation efforts, and easier compliance reporting. 
 Water meter replacement and the adoption and deployment of new technologies comprise the majority of smart water product sales, including radio products. To a much lesser extent, housing starts also contribute to sales annually. The industry continues to undergo a conversion from manually read water meters to meters with radio technology, and for AMR systems to be upgraded to digital AMI solutions. The Company estimates that approximately one-third of water meters installed in the United States have been converted to AMI systems. 
 In addition, the Company provides various other hardware, instruments and sensors, and related software, to enhance the scope and breadth of connected data valuable to a water utility's operation. This includes water quality monitoring solutions utilizing optical sensors and electrochemical instruments that measure a variety of parameters including turbidity, pH, chlorine, nitrates and approximately 40 others. Utilizing these solutions, water quality can be monitored continually or periodically throughout the network from its original source to the point in which it is recycled and returned. Real-time water quality parameters enhance the scope of actionable data for water utilities to improve operational security, awareness and efficiency. It also includes high frequency pressure and leak detection sensors that provide real-time alarms and event location triangulation to aid operators in responding to burst pipe and other leak events quickly, reducing water loss and system downtime. The data and insights collected from these additional operational sensors are often conveyed by cellular networks and can be leveraged alongside of the metering data within BEACON to unlock powerful insights about the operations of a customer's distribution network. 
 The Company s net sales and corresponding net earnings depend on unit volume and product mix, with the Company generally earning higher average selling prices and margins on meters coupled with radio technology, software, water quality monitoring and on ultrasonic compared to mechanical meters. 
 
 Flow Instrumentation Product Line (approximately 15 of Net Sales in fiscal 2023) 
 The flow instrumentation product line primarily serves water applications throughout the broader industrial market, with both standard and customized solutions. These solutions include meters, valves and other sensing instruments sold worldwide to measure and control the quantity of fluids, including water, air, steam, and other liquids and gases. These products, oftentimes leveraging the same technologies used in utility water, are used in a variety of industries and applications, with the Company s primary market focus being water/wastewater, heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) and corporate sustainability. Flow instrumentation products are generally sold through manufacturers representatives and original equipment manufacturers as the primary flow measurement device within a product or system. Specialized communication protocols that control the entire flow measurement process and mandatory certifications drive these markets. 
 The industries served by the Company s flow instrumentation products face accelerating demands to contain costs, reduce product variability, and meet ever-changing safety, regulatory and sustainability requirements. To address these challenges, customers must reap more value from every component in their systems. This system-wide scrutiny has heightened the focus on flow instrumentation and water quality monitoring in wastewater treatment, industrial process, building automation and precision engineering applications where flow measurement, quality and control are critical. 
 
 The Company offers one of the broadest flow measurement, control and communication portfolios in the market. Customers rely on the Company for application-specific solutions that deliver accurate, timely and dependable flow data and control essential for product quality, cost control, safer operations, regulatory compliance and more sustainable operations. 
 Long-Term Business Trends 
 Across the globe significant infrastructure investment needs, aging workforce, increasing regulations and a focus on climate-change and sustainability are driving companies and utilities to better manage critical resources like water. Some customers measure fluids to identify leaks and/or misappropriation for cost control or add measurement points to help automate manufacturing. Other customers employ measurement to comply with government mandates and laws including those associated with process and discharge water quality monitoring. The Company provides flow measurement technology critical to providing baseline usage data and to quantify reductions as customers attempt to reduce consumption. For example, once 
 16 

Table of Contents 

water usage metrics are better understood, a strategy for water-use reduction can be developed with specific water-reduction initiatives targeted to those areas where it is most viable. With the Company s technology, customers have found costly leaks, pinpointed equipment in need of repair, and identified areas for process improvements. 
 Increasingly, customers in the utility water market are interested in more frequent and diverse data collection and the use of water metering, pressure and quality analytics to evaluate water distribution activity. Specifically, AMI technology enables water utilities to capture readings from each meter at more frequent and variable intervals. There are more than 50,000 water utilities in the United States and the Company estimates that approximately one-third of their respective connections have converted to an AMI radio solution. The Company believes it is well positioned to meet the continuing conversion trends to AMI with its comprehensive radio and software solutions. 
 In addition, certain water utilities are converting from mechanical to static meters. Ultrasonic water metering maintains a high level of measurement accuracy over the life of the meter, reducing a utility s non-revenue water. The Company has over a decade of proven reliability in the market with its ultrasonic meters. 
 As noted above, customers are increasingly looking for more frequent and diverse data to holistically manage their water networks. As a leading provider of water quality and pressure management monitoring solutions, we are able to meet these needs and enhance the scope of actionable data for customers to help measure, conserve and protect water. 
 Together, our tailorable smart water solutions provide actionable information through data analytics derived from an interconnected and interoperable network of sensors and devices that help people and organizations efficiently use and conserve water. Badger Meter is well positioned to benefit from the adoption of smart water solutions. With strong relationships with telecommunication providers such as AT T and Verizon (among others), we stay abreast of emerging cellular technology changes to provide the premier infrastructure-free AMI solution. 
 Acquisitions 
 Effective January 1, 2024, the Company acquired select remote water monitoring hardware and software, inclusive of the Telog product line and Unity Remote Monitoring software as a service (the "Telog/Unity Assets). The total purchase consideration for the Telog/Unity Assets was 3.0 million in cash. 
 Effective January 1, 2023, the Company acquired 100 of the outstanding stock of Syrinix Ltd. ("Syrinix"), headquartered in the United Kingdom, a provider of high-frequency pressure monitoring and leak detection solutions. 
 The total purchase consideration for Syrinix, net of cash acquired, was 17.1 million. The Company's allocation of the purchase price at December 31, 2023 included 0.6 million of receivables, 0.7 million of inventories, 2.1 million of other assets, 7.7 million of intangible assets and 10.3 million of goodwill. The intangible assets acquired were primarily developed technology, customer relationships and trademarks with estimated average useful lives of 13 to 15 years. The Company also assumed 1.9 million of payables, 2.0 million of deferred income taxes and 0.4 million of other liabilities as part of the acquisition. 
 Revenue and Product Mix 
 As the industry continues to evolve, the Company has been at the forefront of innovation across measurement hardware (metering, water quality, pressure sensors, etc.), radio and software technologies in order to meet its customers increasing expectations for accurate and actionable data and insights. As technologies such as ORION Cellular and BEACON digital solutions have become more widely adopted, the Company s revenue from SaaS has increased significantly, and is margin accretive. 
 The Company also seeks opportunities for additional revenue enhancement. For instance, the Company has made inroads into select regional markets outside the US such as the Middle East, UK and others with its tailorable smart water solutions portfolio. The Company is periodically asked to oversee and supervise field installation of its products and provide training and other services for certain customers. Strategic mergers and acquisitions are another avenue for profitable sales growth.

Sales of products into the flow instrumentation end markets were 25.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023. Flow instrumentation sales were flat on steady order demand within the water-focused end markets, generally offset by declines across de-emphasized applications. 
 Earnings 
 Total operating earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 40.6 million, or 19.5 of sales, compared to 31.4 million, or 16.9 of sales, in the comparable prior year quarter. Gross margin dollars increased 11.2 million, with gross margin as a percent of sales of 40.2 , an increase from 39.1 of sales in the prior year comparable quarter.

Selling, engineering and administration SEA expenses were 43.3 million or 20.8 of sales compared to 41.3 million or 22.2 of sales in the comparable prior year quarter. The increase in spending primarily relates to higher personnel-related investments, while the year-over-year improvement in SEA expense leverage was the result of effective spending controls and higher sales.

The prior year quarter effective tax rate included a discrete income tax benefit related to stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting transactions.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The main sources of liquidity for the Company are cash from operations and borrowing capacity. In addition, depending on market conditions, the Company may access the capital markets to strengthen its capital position and to provide additional liquidity for general corporate purposes. 
 Primary Working Capital 
 The Company uses primary working capital PWC as a percentage of sales as a key metric for working capital efficiency. The Company defines this metric as the sum of Receivables and Inventories less Payables, divided by trailing twelve-month Net sales. The following table shows the components of our PWC:

Overall, PWC increased 19.2 million compared to the previous year-end. Receivables at September 30, 2024 increased 9.9 million due to higher sales activity. Inventories increased 4.8 million due to component cost inflation, higher safety stock levels and increased sales activity. Payables at September 30, 2024 were 4.5 million less than year-end due primarily to a stabilizing inventory balance and timing of payments relative to quarter-end. 
 Cash Provided by Operations 
 Cash provided by operations in the first nine months of 2024 was 103.0 million compared to 72.2 million in the same period of 2023. Higher net earnings and favorable working capital trends contributed to the increase in cash provided by operations compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Property, plant and equipment expenditures for the first nine months of 2024 were 8.1 million compared to 9.9 million in the comparable prior year period. 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased to 259.0 million from 191.8 million at December 31, 2023, the result of the 103.0 million cash provided by operations, offset by the 3.0 million deployed to acquire the Telog/Unity net assets and payment of quarterly dividends. 
 The Company's credit facility includes a 150.0 million multi-currency line of credit that supports commercial paper (up to 100.0 million). The facility includes several features that enhance the Company's financial flexibility including an increase feature, acquisition holiday, and favorable financial covenants. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. The Company believes that its operating cash flows, available borrowing capacity, and its ability to raise capital provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital expenditures and the development of new products. The Company had 154.5 million of unused credit lines available at September 30, 2024. 
 Other M atters 
 
 On March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules to enhance disclosures pertaining to climate related risks and associated board and management governance of such risks. On April 4, 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed implementation of the rules pending the completion of judicial review of consolidated legal challenges to the rules by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. If the rules go effective as currently contemplated, disclosures will be made prospectively, with phased-in effective dates starting with fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, subject to any additional regulatory or judicial delays. Other governing bodies have passed or are considering passing related legislature requiring certain environmental, social and governance disclosures. The Company is currently assessing the impact of these changes to its consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The Company is subject to contingencies related to environmental laws and regulations. A future change in circumstances with respect to these specific matters or with respect to sites formerly or currently owned or operated by the
