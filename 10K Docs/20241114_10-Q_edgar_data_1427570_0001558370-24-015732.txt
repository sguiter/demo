 million, primarily due to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of million, and million of net accounts receivable. The Company has raised gross proceeds of million from the issuance of a senior secured convertible note on October 16, 2024, for further details see Note 11. Based on its available cash resources, the Company will not have sufficient cash on hand to fund its current operations for more than twelve months from the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s anticipated operations include plans to (i) merge with Vyome Therapeutics, Inc and sell certain assets to Biorad, which will continue the operations, (ii) grow sales and operations of the Company with the Lap-Band product line both domestically and internationally as well as to obtain cost savings synergies, (iii) introduce to the market Lap-Band 2.0 FLEX, (iv) continue development of the Diabetes Bloc-Stim Neuromodulation DBSN device, and (v) prior to such merger and sale, explore and capitalize on synergistic opportunities to expand our portfolio and offer future minimally invasive treatments and therapies in the obesity continuum of care. The Company believes that it has the flexibility to manage the growth of its expenditures and operations depending on the amount of available cash flows, which could include reducing expenditures for marketing and product development activities. There can be no assurance as to whether the Company will close the planned transactions or whether additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. If sufficient funds on acceptable terms are not available when needed, it would have a negative impact on the Company s financial condition and could force the Company to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates or testing products that the Company would otherwise plan to develop. Therefore, the plans cannot be deemed probable of being implemented. As a result, the Company s plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.

Based on the review of the statute of limitations for the various states these vendors were located, legal counsel provided a conclusion regarding whether the laws per the respective states provided that the statute of limitations has expired. The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense in which the defendant introduces evidence, which, if found to be credible, will negate criminal or civil liability, even if it is proven the defendant committed the alleged acts. The party raising the affirmative defense has the burden of proof on establishing that it applies. In a civil action in which a creditor demands payment on a written instrument evidencing a debt, the successful assertion of the statute of limitations defense will bar collection of the debt. In order to assert the statute of limitations as a defense, a defendant must specifically assert the defense is the answer. If a defendant fails to specifically plead the defense, it will be deemed to be waived. Since no action to enforce such liabilities was brought before September 30, 2024, it is our opinion that the liability is time-barred from collection under the respective state laws and should be removed from the Company s balance sheet. Therefore, the Company made the decision to write-off the payables totaling thousand. As of September 30, 2024, the write-off of thousand resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt which was reported on the statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Each unit was sold at the public offering price of . The warrants in the units are immediately exercisable at a price of per share and expire from the date of issuance. Alternatively, each warrant can be exercised pursuant to the alternative cashless exercise provision, to which the holders would receive an aggregate number of shares of common stock equal the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of common stock that would be issuable upon a cash exercise and (y) . For purposes of clarity, one common warrant to purchase one and one -half shares would be exercisable for shares under this alternative cashless exercise provision. The shares of common stock (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrants were only purchasable together in this offering but were issued separately and immediately separable upon issuance. As of September 30, 2024 warrants to purchase shares of common stock have been exercised under the alternative cashless exercise for a total of shares of common stock. Net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, were approximately million. The Company has been using the net proceeds of this offering to continue implementation of its growth strategies, for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company also granted the underwriters an option to purchase an additional shares of common stock and/or additional warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock, to cover over-allotments, of which Maxim Group LLC exercised its option to purchase additional warrants to purchase shares of common stock.

 Issued Exercised ) Cancelled ) Balance September 30, 2024 On February 8, 2023, the Company completed a public offering in which classes of warrants were issued. There were common stock purchase warrants issued with an alternative cashless exercise provision. The alternative cashless exercise allows the holder to exercise one warrant share for shares of common stock or exercise via the cash exercise price of per share of common stock per warrant. The Company classifies these warrants as a liability, and the Company utilized a bifurcated Black-Scholes option pricing model to consider the cash exercise option and cashless exercise option. The bifurcated Black-Scholes option pricing model used an exercise price where the two exercise methods would be indifferent with market inputs of the stock price on the issuance, risk free interest rate, expected share price volatility and dividend yield. The Company calculates the fair value of the warrants at each reporting period and when a warrant is exercised, with the changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. Below is a summary of the initial inputs used in the bifurcated Black-Scholes option pricing model. Exercise Price Term (years) Volatility Risk Free Rate Dividend Yield The following table presents the changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities: Gain on changes in fair value of liability warrants ) Fair value as of September 30, 2024 In addition, of the investors purchased pre-funded warrants at a price of per warrant.

 Australia Europe Rest of World Total revenue Operating Segments The Company conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Australia, Europe and the Rest of World (primarily in the Middle East). All regions sell the Lap-Band system, which consisted of nearly all our revenue and gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There was revenue or gross profit recorded for the DBSN device for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as this product is still in the development stage. Additionally, there was revenue recorded for the Obalon Balloon system during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. thousand and thousand, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of thousand and thousand, respectively. The income tax expense is related to minimum state taxes and projected Australian and Netherlands income, respectively. The income tax provisions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were calculated using the discrete year-to-date method. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of primarily due to the existence of valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets and current liabilities resulting from the estimated state income tax liabilities and foreign tax liabilities. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Based on the level of historical losses, projections of losses in future periods and potential limitations pursuant to changes in ownership under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, the Company provided a full valuation allowance at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Such options generally vest over a period of and expire at after the grant date. The Company recognized compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. The Company uses a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which requires the input of both subjective and objective assumptions as follows: Expected Term The estimate of expected term is based on the historical exercise behavior of grantees, as well as the contractual life of the options granted. Expected Volatility The expected volatility factor is based on the volatility of the Company s common stock for a period equal to the term of the stock options. Risk-free Interest Rate The risk-free interest rate is determined using the implied yield for a traded zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the expected term of the stock options. Expected Dividend Yield The expected dividend yield is based on the Company s historical practice of paying dividends on its common stock.

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures assist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results. Management believes that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial information provides investors with greater transparency and facilitates comparison of operating results across a broad spectrum of companies with varying capital structures, compensation strategies, and amortization methods, which provides a more complete understanding of our financial performance, competitive position, and prospects for the future. However, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in Form 10-Q have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures presented by the Company may be different from similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA Management uses adjusted EBITDA in its evaluation of the Company s core results of operations and trends between fiscal periods and believes that these measures are important components of its internal performance measurement process. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, changes in fair value of liability warrants, and other one-time costs.

This primarily resulted from a small increase in sales volume offset by continued pressure primarily from GLP-1 pharmaceutical weight-loss alternatives. Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit. The following table summarizes our unaudited cost of revenue and gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as well as the percentage compared to total revenue and amount of change and percentage of change (dollars in thousands):

Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 1.4 million, which was slightly above 1.3 million for the same period in 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 62.8 compared to 59.8 for the same period in 2023. The increase in gross profit percentage is due to the reduction in overhead related costs, primarily payroll, as we had a reduction of employees late in 2023.

 Operating Expense. The following table summarizes our unaudited operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as well as the percentage of total revenue and the amount of change and percentage of change (dollars in thousands): 

Three Months Ended September 30, Amount Percentage 2024 2023 Change Change Sales and marketing 719 31.4 1,791 83.1 (1,072) (59.9) General and administrative 2,082 90.8 2,058 95.5 24 1.2 Research and development 399 17.4 542 25.2 (143) (26.4) Impairment of long-lived assets 777 36.1 (777) (100.0) Total operating expenses 3,200 139.6 5,168 239.9 (1,968) (38.1) Sales and Marketing Expense. Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 1.1 million, or 59.9 , to 0.7 million, compared to 1.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease of 0.5 million in advertising and marketing expenses, including consulting and professional marketing services, as the Company has reevaluated its marketing approach and has moved to a targeted digital marketing campaign, resulting in a reduction of costs. Additionally, there was a decrease of 0.5 million in payroll-related expenditures, including commissions, stock compensation expense and travel, due to changes in sales personnel and a reduction in sales, and a reduction of 0.1 million in other expenses. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 24 thousand, or 1.2 , to approximately 2.1 million, compared to 2.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due a 0.4 million increase in professional services primarily related to the merger and asset sale transaction that was entered into during July 2024, offset by a 0.2 million reduction in employee related expenses, 0.1 million in bad debt expense, and 0.1 million in other expenses. Research and Development Expense . Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 0.1 million, or 26.4 to 0.4 million, compared to the same period in the prior year. The primary reason for the decrease is due to a reduction in payroll, consulting and clinical trials, as the Company has paused all clinical work to preserve cash. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Impairment of long-lived assets decreased by 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company impaired approximately 0.8 million, consisting of fixed assets and intangible assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no impairment was recorded. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 Revenue. The following table summarizes our unaudited revenue by geographic location based on the location of customers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as well as the percentage of each location to total revenue and the amount of change and percentage of change (dollars in thousands):

This primarily resulted from a decrease in sales volume primarily due to GLP-1 pharmaceutical weight-loss alternatives.

 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit. The following table summarizes our unaudited cost of revenue and gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as well as the percentage compared to total revenue and amount of change and percentage of change (dollars in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Amount Percentage 2024 2023 Change Change Revenue 6,201 100.0 6,696 100.0 (495) (7.4) Cost of revenue 2,463 39.7 2,990 44.7 (527) (17.6) Gross profit 3,738 60.3 3,706 55.3 32 0.9 Gross Profit. Gross profit for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 3.7 million, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 60.3 compared to 55.3 for the same period in 2023. The increase in gross profit percentage is due to the reduction in overhead related costs, primarily payroll, as we had a reduction of employees late in 2023. Operating Expense. The following table summarizes our unaudited operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as well as the percentage of total revenue and the amount of change and percentage of change (dollars in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Amount Percentage 2024 2023 Change Change Sales and marketing 2,408 38.8 6,150 91.8 (3,742) (60.8) General and administrative 6,074 98.0 8,724 130.3 (2,650) (30.4) Research and development 1,282 20.7 1,576 23.5 (294) (18.7) Impairment of long-lived assets 777 11.6 (777) (100.0) Gain on disposal of assets, net (33) (0.5) 33 (100.0) Total operating expenses 9,764 157.5 17,194 256.8 (7,430) (43.2) Sales and Marketing Expense. Sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 3.7 million, or 60.8 , to 2.4 million, compared to 6.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease of approximately 2.0 million in advertising and marketing expenses, including consulting and professional marketing services, as the Company has reevaluated its marketing approach and has moved to a targeted digital marketing campaign, resulting in a reduction of costs. Additionally, there was a decrease of 1.6 million in payroll-related expenditures, including commissions, stock compensation expense and travel, due to changes in sales personnel and a reduction in sales, and a 0.1 million reduction in other expenses. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 2.7 million, or 30.4 , to 6.1 million, compared to 8.7 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in professional services, such as audit and legal fees of 1.1 million primarily due to the Company incurring one-time adjustments for professional services related to the February 2023 public offering, and a reduction in payroll-related expenditures, including stock-based compensation expense, of 1.0 million due to decline in staffing levels, and a reduction in rent expense of 0.1 million, as we moved our headquarters at the end of the second quarter of 2023 to a smaller facility to reduce costs. Additionally, there was a reduction in bad debt expense of 0.4 million, and a reduction in other miscellaneous expenses of 0.1 million. Research and Development Expense . Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 0.3 million, or 18.7 to 1.3 million, compared to approximately 1.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The primary reason for the decrease is due to a reduction in consulting and clinical trials, as the Company has paused all clinical work to preserve cash.

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Impairment of long-lived assets decreased by 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company impaired approximately 0.8 million, consisting of fixed assets and intangible assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no impairment was recorded. Gain loss on disposal of assets, net. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had a gain of approximately 33 thousand related to the sale of fully depreciated assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no disposals were recorded. Liquidity and Capital Resources The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company currently does not generate revenue sufficient to offset operating costs and anticipates such shortfalls to continue as the Company has modified its strategy to a metrics-driven approach through a sustainable and scalable business model, via a digital lead generation and re-engagement strategy. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had net working capital of approximately 1.3 million, primarily due to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 0.8 million. The Company s principal source of liquidity as of September 30, 2024, consisted of approximately 0.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, and 1.3 million of accounts receivable. Additionally, the Company has raised gross proceeds of 0.7 million from the issuance of a senior secured convertible note on October 16, 2024. Based on its available cash resources, the Company will not have sufficient cash on hand to fund its current operations for more than twelve months from the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company believes in the viability of its business strategy, which includes a merger and asset sale, and in its ability to raise additional funds, however, there can be no assurance to that effect. Management s plans are assuming the merger with Vyome and the asset purchase with Biorad, announced in July of 2024 occur. The following table summarizes our change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (3,740) (14,503) Net cash used in investing activates (10) Net cash provided by financing activities 24 12,113 Effect of exchange rate changes (6) Net change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (3,716) (2,406) Net Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities from operations was 3.7 million and 14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of our net loss of 5.4 million, partially offset by non-cash adjustments for stock-based compensation expense of 0.2 million and inventory reserve of 0.1 million, offset by a negative cash impact of 0.4 million related to old accounts payable that have passed their statute of limitations. We show a positive cash impact on accounts payable of 0.7 million, inventory of approximately 0.7 million, accounts receivable of 0.3 million, and prepaid expenses of 0.1 million For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of our net loss of 9.7 million, partially offset by non-cash adjustments for stock-based compensation expense of 0.7 million, non-cash offering cost of 0.3 million and bad debt expense of approximately 0.5 million, offset by a negative cash impact related to gains recognized for changes in fair value of liability warrants of 3.9 million. We show a negative cash impact on accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 2.8 million, accounts receivable of 0.4 million, and prepaid expenses of 0.3 million. This was offset by a positive cash impact on inventory of 0.3 million.

 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities There was no cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was minimal. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Financing activities provided 24 thousand related to exercise of warrants for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash provided by financing activities was 12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the proceeds received from the public offering completed during February 2023 and April 2023, less costs to complete the transaction and costs paid related to the October 2023 offering. Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements The Company s anticipated operations include plans to (i) merge with Vyome Therapeutics, Inc and sell certain assets to Biorad, which will continue the operations, (ii) grow sales and operations of the Company with the Lap-Band product line both domestically and internationally as well as to obtain cost savings synergies, (iii) introduce to the market Lap-Band 2.0 FLEX, (iv) continue development of the Diabetes Bloc-Stim Neuromodulation DBSN device, and (v) prior to such merger, explore and capitalize on synergistic opportunities to expand our portfolio and offer future minimally invasive treatments and therapies in the obesity continuum of care. The Company believes that it has the flexibility to manage the growth of its expenditures and operations depending on the amount of available cash flows, which could include reducing expenditures for marketing and product development activities. If management s plans do not develop, and the Company does not raise additional cash in addition to the funds raised in October 2024, at the current burn rate, management expects to run out of cash during the fourth quarter of 2024. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of medical devices, such as our Diabetes Bloc-Stim Neuromodulation, we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of the Diabetes Bloc-Stim Neuromodulation or other additional products and successfully deliver a commercial product to the market. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors and will be decided by Biorad, once the pending asset sale is complete. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Information with respect to our critical accounting policies and estimates which we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management is contained in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes from the information discussed therein. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our significant accounting policies, which are fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide disclosure pursuant to this item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), defines the term disclosure controls and procedures as those controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. An internal control material weakness is a significant deficiency, or aggregation of deficiencies, that does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that material misstatements in financial statements will be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their work. An internal control significant deficiency, or aggregation of deficiencies, is one that could result in a misstatement of the financial statements that is more than inconsequential. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting management used the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, and determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at a reasonable assurance level due to the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: Control Environment: The Company has insufficient internal resources with appropriate accounting and finance knowledge and expertise to design, implement, document and operate effective internal controls over the financial reporting process. As a result, there was a lack of management review over several areas of the consolidated financial statements, including errors which were individually assessed as significant deficiencies that, when aggregated, resulted in a material weakness related to: 1) insufficient review of obsolete and scrap inventory; 2) insufficient reviews of accounts payable; and 3) inappropriate application of accounting standards related to functional currency. In addition to these identified errors, there were other areas of the consolidated financial statements that were impacted by certain deficiencies. During the prior year, there were deficiencies identified that have not yet been remediated including misstatements of inaccurate reporting of earnings per share due to formula errors over the weighted average share calculation spreadsheet and errors to the stock-based compensation expense. The root cause of all of the deficiencies identified above was related to insufficient internal resources with appropriate accounting and finance knowledge, which aggregated into this material weakness. Journal Entry Access and Review: The Company did not have effective processes to ensure that all journal entries were properly approved prior to being posted to the general ledger. Furthermore, a segregation of duties conflict is present as the Sr. Accounting Manager has the ability to both prepare and post journal entries to the general ledger. As a result, it was concluded that there is material weakness in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over access and reviews of journal entries. Information Technology IT Access Change and IT Security: A segregation of duties conflict is present as access, change management and other IT security risks to the Company s information technology systems are not monitored or reviewed on a timely basis. This material weakness resulted from the aggregation of various control deficiencies. Financial Reporting:

 Inventory Capitalization The Company s controls were not designed effectively as the Company did not have a process in place to evaluate the amount of inventory, cost of goods sold, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses. Income Taxes The Company did not design and maintain effective management review controls at a sufficient level of precision over the accounting for income taxes. Management s controls surrounding the evaluation of income tax provision and related disclosures were not operating effectively as the disclosure was not updated to reflect the appropriate tax amortization related to the accrued settlement account. While this did not have an impact on the financial statements due to the full valuation allowance recorded on the deferred tax assets, this did have an impact on the presentation of the prior year footnote disclosure. Additionally, there were errors identified within the tax provision during the prior year related to cost of goods sold for the Company s foreign entities. This material weakness resulted in certain material corrections to the financial statements including the establishment of a FIN 48 liability, the tax benefit related to impairment charges recorded for the IPR D in the prior year, the overstatement of the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance related to depreciable assets in the prior year, a return to provision adjustment in 2022 related to Obalon net operating losses generated in 2021 as a result of inaccurate stock compensation recorded within the tax provision and a difference in pretax book income that was unaccounted for in the disclosure. Purchase Accounting The Company did not design and maintain effective management review controls at a sufficient level of precision over the accounting for transactions related to the prepaid D O insurance policy purchased in connection with the merger transaction in June 2021. This material weakness resulted in certain material corrections to the financial statements and in the restatement of the consolidated financial statements. We are currently implementing our remediation plan to address the material weaknesses identified above. Such measures include: Designing and implementing controls to formalize roles and review responsibilities to align with our team's skills and experience and designing and implementing formalized controls. Designing and implementing formal processes, policies and procedures supporting our financial close process. Designing a formal review of a monthly journal entry report to ensure journal entries are appropriately approved within a timely manner. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Other than in connection with executing upon the continued implementation of the remediation measures referenced above, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On August 6, 2021, Cowen and Company, LLC filed a complaint against ReShape, as successor in interest to Obalon Therapeutics, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York based on an alleged breach of contract arising out of Cowen s prior engagement as Obalon s financial advisor. The complaint alleges that Cowen is entitled to be paid a 1.35 million fee in connection with ReShape s merger with Obalon under the terms of Cowen s engagement agreement with Obalon. The complaint also sought reimbursement of Cowen s attorneys fees and interest in connection with its claim. On May 11, 2023, the Supreme Court of the State of New York issued the final judgement in favor of Cowen Company in the amount of 1.35 million, plus interest at the statutory rate of 9 per annum from June 16, 2021 until judgement is paid in full, and reimbursement of 675,000 of Cowen s attorneys fees, with 275,000 to be paid upfront, 200,000 paid after six months and 200,000 paid after 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has paid the judgement, interest and legal fees in full.

RISK FACTORS Except for the additional risk factors set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on April 1, 2024. The Merger may not be consummated unless important conditions are satisfied or waived and there can be no assurance that the Merger will be consummated. The Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by applicable law) to consummate the Merger. Those conditions include, among others: approval of the proposal to issue shares of our common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement and approval of the proposal to sell our assets pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement by our stockholders; approval of the proposal to complete the Merger by Vyome s stockholders; the absence of any adverse law or order promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted, or issued by any government entity that prohibits, restrains, or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the absence of any stop order issued by the SEC suspending the use of such registration statement; the shares of our common stock to be issued in the Merger being approved for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market and approval of the combined company s continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market; subject to certain materiality exceptions, the accuracy of certain representations and warranties of each of Vyome and ReShape contained in the Merger Agreement and the compliance by each party with the covenants contained in the Merger Agreement; and the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to each of Vyome and ReShape. 
 These conditions to the consummation of the Merger may not be satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by applicable law) and, as a result, the Merger may not be consummated at the time expected, or at all. In addition, we or Vyome may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances. Failure to consummate the Merger could negatively impact our future operations and financial results and our future stock price. If the Merger is not consummated for any reason, we may be subjected to a number of material risks, including the following: a decline in the market price of the shares of our common stock to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be consummated and will be beneficial to the value of our business after the closing date of the Merger; having to pay certain costs related to the proposed Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, printing and mailing fees, which must be paid regardless of whether the Merger is consummated; addressing the consequences of operational decisions made since the signing of the Merger Agreement, including because of restrictions on our operations imposed by the terms of the Merger Agreement and decisions to delay or defer capital expenditures; returning the focus of management and personnel to operating ReShape on a standalone basis, without any of the benefits expected to have been provided by the consummation of the Merger; and

 negative reactions from our stockholders, suppliers, employees, and the medical community. 
 In addition to the above risks, we may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Vyome a termination fee of 1.0 million, which may materially adversely affect our financial condition. Our business may be adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of our management on the Merger. A failure to consummate the Merger may also result in negative publicity, reputational harm, litigation against us or our directors and officers, and a negative impression of ReShape in the financial markets. If the Merger is not consummated, we cannot assure our stockholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price. The Merger may disrupt attention of our management from ongoing business operations. We have expended, and expect to continue to expend, significant management resources to consummate the Merger. The attention of our management may be diverted away from the day-to-day operations of our businesses, including implementing initiatives to improve performance, execution of existing business plans and pursuing other beneficial opportunities, in an effort to consummate the Merger. This diversion of management resources could disrupt our operations and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows or the combined company after the closing date of the Merger. The Asset Purchase may not be consummated unless important conditions are satisfied or waived and there can be no assurance that the Asset Sale will be consummated. The Asset Purchase Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by applicable law) to consummate the Asset Sale. Those conditions include, among others: approval of the proposal to sell our assets pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement by our stockholders; satisfaction of conditions regarding the accuracy of representations and warranties and compliance with covenants in the Asset Purchase Agreement; and the absence of any adverse law or order promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted, or issued by any government entity that prohibits, restrains, or makes illegal the consummation of the Asset Sale or the other transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement. 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities In a private transaction, on October 16, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the SPA with an institutional investor (the Investor ). Pursuant to the SPA, the Company agreed to issue the Investor a senior secured convertible note in the aggregate original principal amount of 833,333.34 (the Note ), and also issue to the Investor 7,983 shares of common stock, par value 0.001, of the Company Common Stock as commitment shares to the Investor. In connection with the SPA, the Company issued to the Investor the Note on October 16, 2024, which bears an interest rate of 10 per annum and is due and payable on the earlier of (i) January 16, 2025 and (ii) the date of consummation or termination of the Company s previously announced merger with Vyome Therapeutics, Inc. The initial conversion price of the Note is 5.22 per share of Common Stock. The Note may not be converted by the Investor into shares of Common Stock if such conversion would result in the Investor and its affiliates owning in excess of 4.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of all shares issuable upon conversion of the Note. The Note provides for certain events of default that are typical for a transaction of this type, including, among other things, any breach of the representations or warranties made by the Company or its subsidiaries. In connection with any event of default that results in the acceleration of payment of the Note and while it is continuing, the interest rate on the Note shall accrue at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 24 per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law.
