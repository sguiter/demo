Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts
emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that
is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered
under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company
can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but
any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that
when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the company, as an emerging
growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison
of the company s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth
company which has opted out of utilizing the emerging growth company reduced reporting requirements difficult.

The Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived
assets, including intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset may not
be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected
future pretax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the
carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value. The
measurement of impairment requires management to make estimates of these cash flows related to long-lived assets, as well as other fair
value determinations. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no indicators of impairment.

The fair value of goodwill was determined based on the discounted cash flow method, which is an income
approach, which required the use of inputs that were unobservable in the marketplace (Level 3), including a discount rate that would be
used by a market participant, projections of revenues and cash flows with the revised projections reflecting the increase in freight and
storage costs in the current interim quarter, among others.

If the estimated realizable value of the inventory
is less than cost, the Company makes provisions in order to reduce its carrying value to its estimated market value. The Company also
reviews inventory for slow moving inventory and obsolescence and records allowance for obsolescence.

was approximately of the Company s total sales and the remaining consisted of general gardening, home goods, and other
products and accessories. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, sales of hydroponic products, including ventilation and grow
light systems, were approximately of the Company s total sales and the remaining consisted of general gardening, home
goods and other products and accessories. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million and 
million of inventory stored in China. The Company s majority of long-lived assets are located in California, United States, majority
of the deferred tax assets are US related, and a majority of the Company s revenues are derived from within the United States. 

The Company will recognize forfeitures of such
equity-based compensation as they occur. 

In November 2023, The FASB issued ASU 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments apply to all public entities that are required
to report segment information in accordance with Topic 280, Segment Reporting. The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve reportable
segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The key amendments: 1. Require
that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating
decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. 2. Require that a public entity disclose, on
an annual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. The other segment
items category is the difference between segment revenue less the significant expenses disclosed and each reported measure of segment
profit or loss. 3. Require that a public entity provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets
currently required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting, in interim periods. 4. Clarify that if
the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate
resources, a public entity may report one or more of those additional measures of segment profit. However, at least one of the reported
segment profit or loss measures (or the single reported measure, if only one is disclosed) should be the measure that is most consistent
with the measurement principles used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the public entity s consolidated financial statements.
5. Require that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s)
of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. 6. Require that a public entity that
has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in the ASU and all existing segment disclosures
in Topic 280. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. A public entity should apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods
presented in the financial statements. Upon transition, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should
be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The Company does not expect
the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06,
Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC's Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. This ASU incorporates
certain U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure requirements into the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Codification ).
The amendments in the ASU are expected to clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of Codification Topics,
allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC s existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously
subject to the requirements, and align the requirements in the Codification with the SEC s regulations. In SEC Release No. 33-10532,
Disclosure Update and Simplification, issued August 17, 2018, the SEC referred certain of its disclosure requirements that overlap with,
but require incremental information to, generally accepted accounting principles to the FASB for potential incorporation into the Codification.
The ASU incorporates into the Codification 14 of the 27 disclosures referred by the SEC. They modify the disclosure or presentation requirements
of a variety of Topics in the Codification. The requirements are relatively narrow in nature. Some of the amendments represent clarifications
to, or technical corrections of, the current requirements. Because of the variety of Topics amended, a broad range of entities may be
affected by one or more of those amendments. For entities subject to the SEC s existing disclosure requirements and for entities
required to file or furnish financial statements with or to the SEC in preparation for the sale of or for purposes of issuing securities
that are not subject to contractual restrictions on transfer, the effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC
removes that related disclosure from its rules. For all other entities, the amendments will be effective two years later. However, if
by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the related disclosure from its regulations, the amendments will be removed from the Codification
and not become effective for any entity. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements. 

In September 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities Supplier
Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations. The amendments in this ASU require that a company
that uses a supplier finance program in connection with the purchase of goods or services disclose sufficient information about the program
to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period,
and potential magnitude. ASU 2022-04 is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2022, except for the rollforward of the supplier finance program obligations, which is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. An entity should apply ASU No. 2022-04 retrospectively to all periods in which a
balance sheet is presented, except for the obligation rollforward, which should be applied prospectively. The adoption of this standard
did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair
Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The amendments in
this ASU clarify the guidance in ASC 820 on the fair value measurement of an equity security that is subject to a contractual sale restriction
and require specific disclosures related to such an equity security. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2024. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2020 and January 2021, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and ASU
No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope, respectively (collectively, Topic 848 ). Topic 848 provides optional
expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank
Offered Rate LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The expedients
and exceptions provided by Topic 848 are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In December 2022,
the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which deferred the sunset date
of Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic
848. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt
 Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity
(Subtopic 815-40). This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred
stock, as well as amend the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based
accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the related EPS guidance. This standard is effective for the Company
on July 1, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption is either a modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective
method of transition. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

The Company does not believe other recently issued
but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the consolidated financial position,
statements of operations and cash flows. 

of the equity
interest in Box Harmony with significant influence but does not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control of Box Harmony. The
Company accounts for its ownership interest in Box Harmony following the equity method of accounting, in accordance with ASC 323, Investments
 Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Under this method, the carrying cost is initially recorded at cost and then increased or decreased
by recording its percentage of gain or loss in its statement of operations and a corresponding charge or credit to the carrying value
of the asset. 

Global Social Media, LLC 

On February 10, 2022, the Company entered into
a joint venture agreement with Bro Angel, LLC, Ji Shin and Bing Luo (the GSM Joint Venture Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms
of the GSM Joint Venture Agreement, the parties formed a Nevada limited liability company, Global Social Media, LLC GSM ),
for the principal purpose of providing a social media platform, contents and services to assist businesses, including the Company and
other businesses, in marketing their products. 

Following entry into the GSM Joint Venture Agreement,
GSM issued 10,000 certificated units of membership interest (the GSM Equity Units ), of which the Company was issued 6,000
GSM Equity Units and Bro Angel was issued 4,000 GSM Equity Units. Messrs. Shin and Luo are the owners of 100 of the equity of Bro Angel.
The LLC Agreement prohibits the issuance of additional Equity Units and certain other actions unless approved in advance by Bro Angel,
creating a noncontrolling right that would not be substantive to overcome the majority voting interests held by the Company. 

As of the date of this report, the members had
not completed the capital contributions and no receivables were recorded. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Agreements, the Company
owns of the equity interest in GSM and control of GSM s operations. Based on ASU 2015-02, the Company consolidates GSM into
its financial statements due to its majority equity ownership and control over operations.For the three months ended September 30, 2024

Stock Option 

On May 12, 2022, the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors approved an incentive plan for the Company s executive officers consisting of a cash performance bonus of
 to be awarded to Kevin Vassily, CFO of the Company, and grants of stock option (the Option Grants exercisable to
purchase (i) shares of Common Stock to Chenlong Tan, CEO and (ii) shares of Common Stock to Mr. Vassily. The Option
Grants, which were issued on May 13, 2022, have an exercise price of , a contractual term of 10 years, and consist of six vesting
tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions,
assuming continued employment of the recipients through each vesting date. Each of the six vesting tranches of the Option Grants will
vest when both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at 150 million for the first tranche and increases
by increments of 50 million through the fourth tranche and 100 million thereafter (based on achieving such market capitalization for
five consecutive trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following six operational milestones focused on revenue or
any one of the six operational milestones focused on operating income have been achieved during a given fiscal year. 

The estimated achievement status of the operational
milestones as of September 30, 2024 was as follows:

The Company evaluated the performance condition
and market condition under ASC 718-10-20. The Option Grants are considered an award containing a performance and a market condition and
both conditions (in this case at least one of the performance conditions) must be satisfied for the award to vest. The market condition
is incorporated into the fair value of the award, and that fair value is recognized over the longer of the implied service period or requisite
service period if it is probable that one of the performance conditions will be met. In relation to the five awards deemed probable to
vest, the recognition period ranges from 2.93 years to 9.64 years. If the performance condition is ultimately not met, compensation cost
related to the award should not be recognized (or should be reversed to the extent any expense has been recognized related to such tranche)
because the vesting condition in the award would not have been satisfied. 

On the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was
used to determine for each tranche (i) a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and (ii) the future time when the market capitalization
milestone for such tranche was expected to be achieved. Separately, based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance,
each quarter we determine whether it is probable that the Company will achieve each operational milestone that has not previously been
achieved or deemed probable of achievement and, if so, the future time when the Company expects to achieve that operational milestone.
The Monte Carlo simulation utilized the following inputs:

stock options (the 2024 Stock Options issuable to Chenlong Tan, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, pursuant
to the terms of the iPower Inc. Amended and Restated 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ). Following the
Board s approval, Mr. Tan and the Company entered into a stock option award agreement (the "Stock Option Award
Agreement"). 

According to the Stock Option Award
Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Award Agreement and the Plan, upon vesting of the 2024 Stock
Options, Mr. Tan will have the option to purchase common stock, par value

In February 2022, the Russian Federation began
conducting military operations against Ukraine, and in October 2023, an armed conflict between Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups and
Israeli military forces began, both of which have since escalated into prolonged wars. While we do not do business in those regions, the
military conflicts in Ukraine and in Israel have resulted in global economic uncertainty and increased the cost of various commodities.

to supply chain disruptions which could cause us to seek alternate sources for product supply or suffer consequences that are unexpected
and difficult to mitigate. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position
or results of operations. Although, it is difficult to predict the impact that these factors may have on our business in the future, we
have experienced a delay in, as well as an increase in costs in shipping, and the resulting inventory level increase in our warehouse
facilities, thus resulting in reduced profits. In addition, supply chain disruptions may put upward pressure on our costs and increase
the risk that we may be unable to acquire the materials and services we need to continue to make certain products.

Overview 

Driven
by tech and data, iPower Inc. is an online supplier of consumer goods, including hydroponics equipment, general gardening supplies, and
consumer home goods. Through the operations of our e-commerce platforms and channel partners, our combined 121,000 square foot fulfillment
centers in Rancho Cucamonga and Los Angeles, California, we believe we are one of the leading marketers, distributors and retailers in
the consumer gardening and home goods categories, based on management s estimates. Our core strategy continues to focus on expanding
our geographic reach across the United States and internationally through organic growth, both in terms of expanding customer base as
well as brand and product development. iPower has developed a set of methodologies driven by proprietary data formulas to effectively
bring products to market and sales. 

We
are actively developing our in-house branded products and through supply chain partners, which to date include the iPower and Simple
Deluxe brands and more, some of which have been designated as Amazon best seller product leaders and Amazon Choice products,
among others. 

Trends
and Expectations 

Product and Brand Development 

We
plan to increase investments in product and brand development. We actively evaluate potential acquisition opportunities of companies and
product brand names that can complement our product catalog and improve our existing products and supply chain efficiencies. 

35 

Global Economic Disruption 

While
at present the majority of our products are sourced either in the United States or China, the military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine
and Israel and Hamas may nonetheless increase the likelihood of supply chain disruptions and hinder our ability to find the materials
we need to make our products. Thus far, as a result of the general global economic disruptions, we have experienced a decrease in the
speed with which we are able to purchase new inventory, as well as an increase in costs due to delays in shipping, the resulting increase
in time with which products remain in our warehouse facilities, thus resulting in reduced profits. In addition, supply chain disruptions
may make it harder for us to find favorable pricing and reliable sources for the materials we need, putting upward pressure on our costs
and increasing the risk that we may be unable to acquire the materials and services we need to continue to make certain products. 

Regulatory
Environment 

We
sell hydroponic gardening products to end users that may use such products in new and emerging industries or segments, including the growing
of cannabis. The demand for hydroponic gardening products depends on the uncertain growth of these industries or segments due to varying,
inconsistent, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and
consumer perceptions. For example, certain countries and a total of 46 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia have adopted frameworks
that authorize, regulate and tax the cultivation, processing, sale and use of cannabis for medicinal and/or non-medicinal use, including
legalization of hemp and CBD, while the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and the laws of U.S. states prohibit growing cannabis. Demand for
our products could be impacted by changes in the regulatory environment with respect to such industries and segments. 

Recent
Developments 

On
June 18, 2024, we closed on the registered direct offering (the Offering of 2,083,334 shares of common stock (the Shares and a concurrent private placement (the Private Placement of warrants Warrants to purchase 2,083,334
shares of common stock (the Warrant Shares ), which were sold for gross aggregate proceeds of 5,000,002.
The Shares were sold pursuant to a prospectus supplement, filed on June 18, 2024, to the registration statement on Form S-3, originally
filed on September 25, 2023 with the SEC (File No. 333-274665), and declared effective on September 29, 2023. The Warrants, which were
issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) or Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
 Securities Act ), have a term of five years and are immediately exercisable at 2.40 per share. The Shares and Warrants were
sold to purchasers named on the signature page of a certain securities purchase agreement, dated June 16, 2024, between the Company and
the purchaser (the Purchase Agreement ). Roth Capital Partners, LLC acted as the placement agent, pursuant to a placement
agency agreement. The Company paid compensation to the placement agent consisting of a cash fee equal to 6.5 of the gross proceeds of
the Offering plus reimbursement of certain expenses and legal fees. 

On
July 9, 2024, as required by the Purchase Agreement, we filed a resale registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC (the "Resale
Form S-1"). Upon filing an amendment on July 23, 2024, the Resale Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC on July 26, 2024.

Revenues 

 Revenues
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 28.3 to 19,008,521 as compared to 26,508,374 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. While pricing remained stable and with the additional logistics service income, the decrease was mainly due to the combination
of decreased orders from Amazon and temporary disruption of product supply during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and the increased
sales generated from promotional activities in the same quarter in 2023. 

Costs of Goods Sold 

 Costs of goods sold for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 28.7 to 10,520,624 as compared to 14,749,529 for the three months ended September 30,
2023. The decrease was primarily due to a combination of the costs related to the logistics service income and the decrease in sales,
freight costs, and lowered product costs resulted from management s efforts on supply chain management. 

37 

Gross Profit 

 Gross profit was 8,487,897
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 11,758,845 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The gross profit
ratio of the product sales revenues increased to 45.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 44.4 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The increase in the gross profit ratio was mainly driven by the decrease in costs of goods sold during the three months
ended September 30, 2024, as discussed above. 

Operating Expenses 

 Operating expenses for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 13.8 to 11,234,331 as compared to 13,027,522 for the three months ended September 30,
2023. The decrease was mainly due to the combination of a decrease in selling and fulfillment expenses of 4.1 million as a result of
decreased costs related to advertising, merchant fees, rental expenses and delivery fees, and an increase in general and administrative
expenses of 2.4 million, which included payroll expenses, stock-based compensation expense, insurance expenses, allowance for credit
losses, travel expenses and other operating expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due
to the expansion of our vendor network and development of the SuperSuite platform and an increased allowance for credit loss and inventory
reserves of 1.76 million. 

Loss from Operations 

Loss from operations was 2,746,434
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1,268,677 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in
loss resulted from the decrease in sales being greater than the decrease in operating expenses and the increase in gross profit ratio. 

Other Income (Expenses) 

Other income (expenses) consist
of interest expense and other non-operating income (expenses). Other income (expenses) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was
 77,805 as compared to (296,556) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other income (expenses) was mainly due
to the combination of an increase in other non-operating income of 285,852, and a decrease in interest, including amortization of debt
discount, on the revolving loan of 88,403 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from the decreasing loan balance. 

Net Loss Attributable to iPower Inc. 

 Net loss attributable to iPower
Inc. for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,029,281 as compared to 1,286,515 for the three months ended September 30, 2023,
representing an increase in net loss of 742,766. The increase was primarily due to the decrease in sales being greater than the decrease
in operating expenses and the increase in gross profit ratio as discussed above. 

Comprehensive Loss Attributable to iPower
Inc. 

 Comprehensive loss attributable
to iPower Inc. for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,084,335 as compared to 1,287,222 for the three months ended September
30, 2023, representing an increase in comprehensive loss of 797,113. The increase was due to the reasons discussed above, along with
an increase in other comprehensive loss of 54,347 as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the translation
of RMB, the functional currency of our VIE in the PRC, to USD, the reporting currency of the Company. 

38 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Sources
of Liquidity 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we primarily funded our operations with cash and cash equivalents generated from operations,
as well as through borrowing under our credit facility from JPMorgan Chase Bank JPM ). Additionally, on June 18, 2024,
we closed on the registered direct offering of 2,083,334 Shares and a concurrent Private Placement of Warrants to purchase up to 2,083,334
Warrant Shares, which Shares and Warrants were sold for gross aggregate proceeds of 5,000,002. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash
and cash equivalents of 2,577,305, representing a 4,800,532 decrease from 7,377,837 in cash as of June 30, 2024. The cash decrease
was primarily due to the result of cash used in operating activities and financing activities resulting
from our payments to pay down the short-term loans - related party and the JPM revolving line of credit. 

Based
on our current operating plans, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient
to finance our operations during the next 12 months. 

Our
cash requirements consist primarily of day-to-day operating expenses and obligations with respect to warehouse leases. We lease all our
office and warehouse facilities. We expect to make future payments on existing leases from cash generated from operations. We have credit
terms in place with our major suppliers, however as we bring on new suppliers, we are often required to prepay our inventory purchases
from them. This is consistent with our historical operating model which allowed us to operate using only cash generated by the business.
Beyond the next 12 months we believe that our cash flow from operations should improve as supply chain operations normalize and new suppliers
we are bringing online transition to credit terms more favorable to us. In addition, we plan to increase the size of our in-house product
catalog, which will have a net beneficial impact to our margin profile and ability to generate cash. Currently, we have approximately
 11.0 million in unused credit under the revolving line with JPM. Given our current working capital position and available funding from
our revolving credit line, we believe we will be able to manage through the current challenges by managing payment terms with customers
and vendors. 

Given
our current working capital position and available funding from our revolving credit line and proceeds from our June Registered Direct
offering, we believe we will be able to work through the current challenges by managing payment terms with customers and vendors. 

Working
Capital 

As
of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, our working capital was 12.2 million and 11.2 million, respectively. The historical
seasonality in our business during the year can cause cash and cash equivalents, inventory and accounts payable to fluctuate,
resulting in changes in our working capital. We anticipate that past historical trends to remain in place through the balance of the
fiscal year with working capital remaining near this level for the foreseeable future. 

Cash
Flows 

Operating Activities 

 Our
largest source of cash provided by operations is from sales of products. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments
to suppliers for products, to employees for compensation, and other general expenses. Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (1,415,643) and 4,052,341, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by
operating activities mainly resulted from a decrease in cash received from customers and an increase in cash paid for cost of revenues
and operating expenses. 

39 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 202,140 and 0, respectively. The increase
was due to the prepayments made for software developments during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

Financing Activities 

Net
cash used in financing activities was 3,308,599 and 5,075,000, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.
The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in payments on the revolving loan. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have
a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
AND ESTIMATES 

We
prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP,
and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur
from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences
between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition and results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates
on experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing
basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies, which we discuss further below. While our significant
accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we believe that
the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue
recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenues from service and product sales, net of promotional discounts and return allowances, when the following revenue
recognition criteria are met: a contract has been identified, separate performance obligations are identified, the transaction price is
determined, the transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations and revenue is recognized upon satisfying each performance
obligation. The Company transfers the risk of loss or damage upon shipment or completion of service, therefore, revenue from product sales
is recognized when it is shipped to the customer and the revenue from services is recognized upon completion of services. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue
by the Company s best estimate of expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience. 

The
Company evaluates the criteria of ASC 606 - Revenue Recognition Principal Agent Considerations in determining whether it is appropriate
to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when the Company is
primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide a specified good or service and the Company has discretion in establishing
the price, revenue is recorded at gross. 

40 

Payments
received prior to the delivery of goods to customers are recorded as customer deposits. 

The
Company periodically provides incentive offers to its customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such
as percentage discounts off current purchases and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by the Company s
customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction. 

Sales
discounts are recorded in the period in which the related sales are recorded. Sales return allowances are estimated based on historical
amounts and are recorded upon recognizing the related sales. Shipping and handling costs are recorded as selling expenses. 

Accounts receivable,
net 

During the ordinary course
of business, the Company extends unsecured credit to its customers. Accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to
collect from customers, which includes the amount withheld by sales channel partners and refundable to the Company. Based on historical
an expected loss rate and status of negotiations with the sales channel partner, management reviews its accounts receivable balances each
reporting period to determine if an allowance for credit loss is required. 

The
Company evaluates the creditworthiness of all of its customers individually before accepting them and continuously monitors the recoverability
of accounts receivable. If there are any indicators that a customer may not make payment, the Company may consider making provision for
non-collectability for that particular customer. At the same time, the Company may cease further sales or services to such customer. The
following are some of the factors that the Company develops allowance for credit losses: 

the customer fails to comply with its payment schedule; 

the customer is in serious financial difficulty; 

a significant dispute with the customer has occurred regarding job progress or other matters; 

the customer breaches any of its contractual obligations; 

the customer appears to be financially distressed due to economic or legal factors; 

the business between the customer and the Company is not active; and 

other objective evidence indicates non-collectability of the accounts receivable. 

Accounts
receivable are recognized and carried at carrying amount less an allowance for credit losses, if any. The Company maintains an allowance
for credit losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments based on contractual terms. The Company reviews
the collectability of its receivables on a regular and ongoing basis. The Company has also included in calculation of allowance for credit
losses the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers businesses and their ability to pay their accounts receivable.
After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. The Company also considers
external factors to the specific customer, including current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions, including the potential
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event we recover amounts previously written off, we will reduce the specific allowance for credit
losses. In late October 2024, the Company determined that the collectability of certain shortage claim receivables from Amazon was remote
so the Company recorded additional allowance for credit losses of approximately 1.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

41 

Inventory,
net 

Inventory
consists of finished goods ready for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or market. The Company values its inventory using the weighted
average costing method. The Company s policy is to include as a part of inventory and cost of goods sold any freight incurred to
ship the product from its vendors to warehouses. Outbound freight costs related to shipping costs to customers are considered period costs
and reflected in selling and fulfillment expenses. The Company regularly review inventory and consider forecasts of future demand, market
conditions and product obsolescence. 

If
the estimated realizable value of the inventory is less than cost, the Company makes provisions in order to reduce its carrying value
to its estimated market value. The Company also reviews inventory for slow moving and obsolescence and records allowance for obsolescence. 

Variable
interest entities 

On
February 15, 2022, the Company acquired 100 of the ordinary shares of Anivia and its subsidiaries, including Daheshou (Shenzhen) Information
Technology Co., Ltd., a company organized under the Laws of the PRC DHS ). Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, the
Company does not have direct ownership in DHS but is actively involved in DHS s operations as the sole manager to direct the activities
and significantly impact DHS s economic performance. DHS s operational funding is provided by the Company after February 15,
2022. During the term of the agreements, which run for a term of 10 years from February 2022 to February 2032, the Company bears all the
risk of loss and has the right to receive all of the benefits from DHS. As such, based on the determination that the Company is the primary
beneficiary of DHS, in accordance with ASC 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J, DHS is considered a variable interest entity VIE of the Company and the financial statements of DHS have been consolidated from the date such control existed, February 15, 2022. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for goodwill
under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other . 

Goodwill
is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment,
at the reporting unit level. The Company s review for impairment includes an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether
it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If it is determined
that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill, a quantitative
goodwill impairment test is performed, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amounts, including goodwill.
If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. However,
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that
excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 

42 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company performed a qualitative and quantitative goodwill impairment
analysis following the steps laid out in ASC 350-20-35-3C and noted no goodwill impairment. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the
goodwill balance amounted to 3,034,110 and 3,034,110, respectively. 

Intangible
Assets, net 

Finite
life intangible assets at September 30, 2024 include a covenant not to compete, supplier relationships and software recognized as part
of the acquisition of Anivia. Intangible assets are recorded at the estimated fair value of these items at the date of acquisition, February
15, 2022. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life as follows: 

Useful Life 
 
 Covenant Not to Compete 
 
 10 years 
 
 Supplier relationship 
 
 6 years 
 
 Software 
 
 5 years 

The
Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that
indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the ability to recover
the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related
operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between
estimated fair value and carrying value. The measurement of impairment requires management to make estimates of these cash flows related
to long-lived assets, as well as other fair value determinations. As of September 30, 2024, there were no indicators of impairment. 

Stock-based
Compensation 

The
Company applies ASC No. 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payment transactions with
employees and nonemployees upon adoption of ASU 2018-07, be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity instrument and recognized
as compensation expense over the requisite service period, with a corresponding addition to equity. Under this method, compensation cost
related to employee share options or similar equity instruments is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and
is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the
vesting period. In addition to the requisite service period, the Company also evaluates the performance condition and market condition
under ASC 718-10-20. For an award that contains both a performance and a market condition, and where both conditions must be satisfied
in order for the award to vest, the market condition is incorporated into the fair value of the award, and that fair value is recognized
over the employee s requisite service period or nonemployee s vesting period if it is probable that the performance condition
will be met. If the performance condition is ultimately not met, compensation cost related to the award should not be recognized (or should
be reversed) because the vesting condition in the award has not been satisfied. 

The
Company will recognize forfeitures of such equity-based compensation as they occur. 

43 

Income
taxes 

The Company accounts for income
taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their perspective tax bases. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets
to the amount expected to be realized. 

The Company has analyzed filing
positions in each of the federal and state jurisdictions where the Company is required to file income tax returns, as well as open tax
years in such jurisdictions. The Company has identified the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and the states of Nevada and California, as its
 major tax jurisdictions. However, the Company has certain tax attribute carryforwards which will remain subject to review
and adjustment by the relevant tax authorities until the statute of limitations closes with respect to the year in which such attributes
are utilized. 

The Company believes that
our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in
a material change to its financial position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to
ASC 740, Income Taxes. The Company s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with income-based tax audits is to record
such items as a component of income taxes. 

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements 

Other
than as set forth under Note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements under Recently issued accounting pronouncements, 
the Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on the consolidated financial position, statements of operations and cash flows. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a smaller reporting
company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

44 

As of September 30, 2024,
our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our management
concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective because, among other things, our controls related to the financial statement closing process
were not adequately designed or appropriately implemented to identify material misstatements in our financial reporting on a timely basis.
Management has evaluated remediation plans to address these deficiencies and is implementing changes to address the material weakness
identified, including hiring additional accountants and consultants and implementing controls and procedures over the financial reporting
process. 

Changes in Internal Controls 

There have been no changes
in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

UHY LLP, our independent registered
public accounting firm, is not required to and has not provided an assessment concerning the design or effectiveness of our internal controls
over financial reporting.
