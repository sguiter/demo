 NM - Percentage is not meaningful 
 Revenues 
 Revenues increased 10,261, or 24 , to 53,307 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. The net increase was attributable to the following: 
 Increase in revenues from league distributions 9,727 Other net increases 534 10,261 
 The increase in revenues from league distributions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in certain league distributions unrelated to national media rights fees. 
 Direct operating expenses 
 Direct operating expenses increased 4,691 to 8,211 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. The net increase was attributable to the following: 
 Increase in net provisions for league revenue sharing expense (net of escrow and excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax 4,126 Increase in net provisions for certain team personnel transactions 833 Other net decreases (268) 4,691 
 The increase in net provisions for league revenue sharing expense (net of escrow and excluding playoffs) and NBA luxury tax for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the net impact of adjustments to prior seasons revenue sharing expense (net of escrow). 
 Net provisions for certain team personnel transactions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflect provisions recorded for waiver/contract terminations of 833. 
 Direct operating expenses for fiscal year 2025 are expected to reflect higher team personnel compensation and corresponding NBA luxury tax due to the Knicks 2024-25 season roster. Based on the current roster, the Knicks would be a significant luxury tax payer for the 2024-25 season.

Table of Contents 

 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of (i) administrative costs, including compensation, costs under the Company s Services Agreement, professional fees, and operating lease costs, (ii) fees related to the Company s sponsorship sales and service representation agreements, and (iii) sales and marketing costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses generally do not fluctuate in line with changes in the Company s revenues and direct operating expenses. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 969, or 2 , to 52,587 as compared to the prior year period driven by (i) lower sales and marketing costs of 744, (ii) lower employee compensation and related benefits of 617, and (iii) lower other general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher professional fees of 1,181. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 12, or 2 , to 782 as compared to the prior year period. 
 Operating loss 
 Operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 6,551, or 44 , to 8,273 as compared to the prior year period primaril y due to higher revenues and, to a lesser extent, lower selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher direct operating expenses. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 411, or 91 , to 864 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher average cash balances in the current year period. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 874, or 13 , to 6,055 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower average borrowings under the Rangers Revolving Credit Facility in the current year period, partially offset by higher average borrowings under the Knicks Revolving Credit Facility in the current year period. 
 Miscellaneous expense, net 
 Miscellaneous expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 11,539, or 91 , to 1,126 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower unrealized losses in the current year period related to the Company s investments in Xtract One common stock and warrants. 
 Income taxes 
 See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the Company s income taxes. 
 Adjusted operating loss 
 The Company evaluates performance based on several factors, of which the key financial measure is operating income (loss) excluding (i) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, (ii) share-based compensation expense or benefit, (iii) restructuring charges or credits, (iv) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses, (v) the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to business acquisitions, and (vi) gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities under the Company s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which is referred to as adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP measure. 
 Management believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the Company s business without regard to the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash. In addition, management believes that the exclusion of gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities under the Company s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan provides investors with a clearer picture of the Company s operating performance given that, in accordance with GAAP, gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities under the Company s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan are recognized in Operating income (loss) whereas gains and losses related to the remeasurement of the assets under the Company s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which are equal to and therefore fully offset the gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities, are recognized in Miscellaneous income (expense), net, which is not reflected in Operating income (loss). 
 The Company believes adjusted operating income (loss) is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company. Adjusted operating income (loss) and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors and analysts to analyze the Company s performance. The Company uses revenues and adjusted operating 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 income (loss) measures as the most important indicators of its business performance and evaluates management s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. 
 Adjusted operating income (loss) should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Since adjusted operating income (loss) is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. The Company has presented the components that reconcile operating income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to adjusted operating income (loss). 
 The following are the reconciliations of operating loss to adjusted operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Operating loss (8,273) (14,824) 6,551 44 Depreciation and amortization 782 794 Share-based compensation 4,268 4,149 Remeasurement of deferred compensation plan liabilities 965 (104) Adjusted operating loss (a) 
 (2,258) (9,985) 7,727 77 
 _________________ 
 (a) Adjusted operating loss includes operating lease costs which is comprised of a contractual cash component plus or minus a non-cash component for each period presented. Pursuant to GAAP, recognition of operating lease costs is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement based upon the value of total future payments under the arrangement. Adjusted operating loss includes operating lease costs of (i) 854 and 829 of expense paid in cash for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and (ii) a non-cash expense of 457 and 482, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted operating loss decreased 7,727, or 77 , to 2,258 as compared to the prior year period. The decrease in adjusted operating loss was primarily due to higher revenues and, to a lesser extent, lower selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher direct operating expenses. 
 Adjusted operating income (loss) for fiscal year 2025 is expected to reflect higher team personnel compensation and corresponding NBA luxury tax due to Knicks 2024-25 season roster.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the Knicks Credit Agreement, the Rangers Credit Agreement, and the Rangers NHL Advance Agreement (each as defined therein). 
 Our principal uses of cash include the operation of our businesses, working capital-related items, the repayment of outstanding debt, repurchases of shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock, dividends, if declared, and investments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 52,252 in C ash and cash equivale nts. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s deferred revenue obligations were 272,957, net of billed, but not yet collected deferred revenue. This balance is primarily comprised of obligations in connection with tickets, suites, and local media rights. 
 We regularly monitor and assess our ability to meet our net funding and investing requirements. The decisions of the Company as to the use of its available liquidity will be based upon the ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, management s view of a favorable allocation of cash resources, and the timing of cash flow generation. To the extent the Company desires to access alternative sources of funding through the capital and credit markets, restrictions imposed by the NBA and NHL and potentially challenging U.S. and global economic and market conditions could adversely impact its ability to do so at that time. 
 We believe we have sufficient liquidity, including approximately 52,252 in Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, along with 250,000 of additional available borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities, to fund our operations and satisfy any obligations for the foreseeable future. If MSG Networks were to experience a bankruptcy or insolvency event (as set forth in each of the credit facilities), we would be prevented, absent a cure or waiver, from making borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. The Rangers Credit Agreement also includes an event of default that is implicated by a bankruptcy or insolvency event with respect to a material media rights counterparty, including MSG Networks. There were no borrowings under the Rangers Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 Financing Agreements and Stock Repurchases 
 See Note 12 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for discussions of the Company s debt obligations and various financing agreements, and the Company s stock repurchases, respectively. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The Company did not have any material changes in its contractual obligations since the end of fiscal year 2024 other than activities in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 Cash Flow Discussion 
 The following table summarizes the Company s cash flow activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net loss (7,542) (18,821) Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities: 195 2,445 Changes in working capital assets and liabilities (18,811) (37,765) Net cash used in operating activities (26,158) (54,141) Net cash used in investing activities (1,163) (1,729) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (9,502) 67,830 Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (36,823) 11,960 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 27,983 to 26,158 as compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to changes in working capital assets and liabilities and the decrease in net loss adjusted for non-cash items. The changes in working capital assets and liabilities were primarily driven by (i) a higher increase in deferred revenue of 25,806 primarily due to higher collections of ticket, suites, and sponsorship sales in advance of recognition, (ii) a lower decrease in accrued and other liabilities of 10,914 primarily due to lower payments related to employee compensation in the current year period, and (iii) a lower decrease in net related party receivables of 8,552 primarily due to primarily due to the 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 timing of collections related to the Company s arena license agreements. These changes were partially offset by (i) an increase in accounts receivable, net of 16,851 primarily due to higher receivables related to league distributions in the current year period and (ii) a higher increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 5,034 primarily due to higher prepayments related to team personnel compensation in the current year period. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 566 to 1,163 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower purchases of investments in the current year period. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 9,502 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 67,830. This was primarily due to additional borrowings under the Company s credit facilities in the prior year period. 
 
 Seasonality of Our Business 
 The Company s dependence on revenues from its NBA and NHL sports teams generally means that it earns a disproportionate share of its revenues in the second and third quarters of the Company s fiscal year, which is when the majority of the sports teams games are played. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Policies 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The following discussion has been included to provide the results of our annual impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets performed during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 
 Goodwill 
 The carrying amount of goodwill as of September 30, 2024 was 226,523. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as of August 31 st and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances. The Company performs its goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is the same as or one level below the operating segment level. The Company has one operating and reportable segment, and one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. 
 The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If the Company can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would not need to perform a quantitative impairment test for that reporting unit. If the Company cannot support such a conclusion or the Company does not elect to perform the qualitative assessment, quantitative assessment is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The estimates of the fair value of the Company s reporting units are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the selection of the appropriate discount rate, the estimate of the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and identification of appropriate continuing growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in the analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows. The amount of an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.

Table of Contents 

 The Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment of impairment for the Company s reporting unit for the fiscal year 2025 impairment test. These assessments considered factors such as: 
 macroeconomic conditions; 
 industry and market considerations; 
 market capitalization; 
 cost factors; 
 overall financial performance of the reporting unit; 
 other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; and 
 relevant reporting unit specific events such as changes in the carrying amount of net assets. 
 The Company performed its most recent annual impairment test of goodwill during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and there was no impairment of goodwill. Based on this impairment test, the Company concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. 
 Identifiable Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
 Identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment as of August 31 st and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The following table sets forth the amount of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets reported in the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024: 
 Sports franchises 102,564 Photographic related rights 1,080 103,644 
 The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In the qualitative assessment, the Company must evaluate the totality of qualitative factors, including any recent fair value measurements, that impact whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset other than goodwill has a carrying amount that more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The Company must proceed to conducting a quantitative analysis, if the Company (i) determines that such an impairment is more likely than not to exist, or (ii) forgoes the qualitative assessment entirely. Under the quantitative assessment, the impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For all periods presented, the Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment of impairment for the indefinite-lived intangible assets. These assessments considered the events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset. Examples of such events and circumstances include: 
 cost factors; 
 financial performance; 
 legal, regulatory, contractual, business or other factors; 
 other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; 
 industry and market considerations; and 
 macroeconomic conditions. 
 The Company performed its most recent annual impairment test of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and there were no impairments identified. Based on this impairment test, the Company concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets was less than their carrying amount.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There were no material changes to the disclosures regarding market risks in connection with our interest rate risk exposure. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 
 Potential interest rate risk exposure: 
 We have potential interest rate risk exposure related to outstanding borrowings incurred under our credit facilities. Changes in interest rates may increase interest expense payments with respect to any borrowings incurred under the credit facilities. 
 Borrowings under our credit facilities incur interest, depending on our election, at a floating rate based upon SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment, the U.S. Federal Funds Rate or the U.S. Prime Rate, plus, in each case, a fixed spread. If appropriate, we may seek to reduce such exposure through the use of interest rate swaps or similar instruments. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total o f 275 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in floating interest rates prevailing as of September 30, 2024 and continuing for a full year would increase interest expense by approximately 2.8 million. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the Knicks Credit Agreement, Rangers Credit Agreement, and Rangers NHL Advance Agreement. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024 the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits. Although the outcome of these lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty (including the extent of available insurance, if any), management does not believe that resolution of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 The risk factor set forth below should be read carefully in conjunction with the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Local Media Rights Are a Significant Revenue Stream for Our Business and Decreases in Local Media Rights Revenue Could Have a Material Negative Effect on our Business and Results of Operations. 
 Solvency and business disruptions impacting our broadcasting partner, MSG Networks, including the work-out or bankruptcy of MSG Networks (as discussed below) and actions by the NBA or NHL or their national broadcast partners, could adversely affect the revenue that can be derived from these media rights. 
 In October 2015, the Knicks and the Rangers entered into 20-year local media rights agreements with MSG Networks, a regional sports network and wholly-owned subsidiary of Sphere Entertainment. These agreements provide MSG Networks with exclusive local linear and digital rights to home and away games of the Knicks and the Rangers, as well as other team-related programming. 
 In recent years, certain regional sports networks have experienced financial difficulties. For example, in March 2023, Diamond Sports Group, an unconsolidated subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcasting Group Inc., which licenses and distributes sports content in a number of regional markets, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. As a result, the majority of Diamond Sports Group s media rights agreements have either been rejected in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings or have expired without renewal. For example, during its bankruptcy, Diamond Sports Group ended its media rights agreements with a number of NHL and NBA and MLB teams, including the Phoenix Suns of the NBA and the Dallas Stars of the NHL, and proposed the rejection of nearly all of its media rights agreements with the MLB teams in its portfolio. 
 MSG Networks was not able to refinance its credit facilities prior to the maturity thereof in October 2024 and entered into a forbearance agreement with its lenders that terminates on November 8, 2024. MSG Networks has indicated that it is pursuing a work-out of its indebtedness and, if the work-out is not successful, may seek bankruptcy protection prior to the lenders exercising their rights under its credit facilities. As part of a work-out or bankruptcy proceeding, MSG Networks may attempt to renegotiate its media rights agreements prior to expiration, including to reduce the fees thereunder, or in the absence of renegotiation, may seek to discharge those agreements. Media rights revenues for the Knicks and Rangers totaled 175.3 million in fiscal year 2024 and stated rights fees for fiscal year 2025 total up to approximately 186.7 million (which amounts are subject to reduction if games broadcast by the leagues national broadcast partners exceed certain numbers of games). If MSG Networks were to discharge its media rights agreements with us as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we would lose a significant recurring revenue stream with stated rights fees that increase annually, and would also lose the exposure provided by the MSG Networks broadcasting related to the Knicks and the Rangers, any of which could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. Although we would pursue alternative sources of distribution for home and away games of the Knicks and the Rangers, as well as other team-related programming, there can be no assurances as to the timing or success of such alternative sources of distribution, all of which would be subject to the approval of the applicable league. In addition, financial difficulties by MSG Networks may have negative implications under our credit facilities. For example, the Rangers Credit Agreement (as defined herein), which had no borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024, includes an event of default that is implicated by a bankruptcy or insolvency event (as set forth in the Rangers Credit Agreement) with respect to a material media rights counterparty, including MSG Networks. See Economic and Business Relationship Risks Certain of Our Subsidiaries Have Incurred Substantial Indebtedness, and the Occurrence of an Event of Default Under Our Subsidiaries Credit Facilities or Our Inability to Repay Such Indebtedness When Due Could Substantially Impair the Assets of Those Subsidiaries and Have a Negative Effect on Our Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had approximately 185 million remaining under the 525 million Class A Common Stock share repurchase program authorized by the Company s Board of Directors on September 11, 2015. Under the authorization, shares of Class A Common Stock may be purchased from time to time in open market or private transactions, block trades or such other manner as the Company may determine, in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations, with the timing and amount of purchases depending on market conditions and other factors. The Company has funded and expects to continue to fund stock repurchases, if any, through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and available borrowing capacity under its existing credit facilities. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not make any share repurchases under its share repurchase program.
