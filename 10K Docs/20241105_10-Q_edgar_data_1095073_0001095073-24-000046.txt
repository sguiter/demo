 The aggregate fair value and gross unrealized losses related to fixed maturity securities - available for sale in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 were billion and million, respectively. The fair value of securities for the single issuer (the U.S. government), whose securities comprised the largest unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024, amounted to less than of the overall fair value of the Company s fixed maturity securities - available for sale. The fair value of the securities for the issuer with the second largest unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 comprised less than of the Company s fixed maturity securities available for sale. In addition, as indicated on the above table, there was no significant concentration of unrealized losses in any one market sector. The million of unrealized losses related to fixed maturity securities - available for sale that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than one year were generally comprised of domestic and foreign corporate securities, agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and foreign government securities. Of these unrealized losses, million were related to securities that were rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. The million of unrealized losses related to fixed maturity securities - available for sale in an unrealized loss position for more than one year related primarily to domestic and foreign corporate securities, agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and foreign government securities. Of these unrealized losses, million were related to securities that were rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. In all instances, there were no projected cash flow shortfalls to recover the full book value of the investments and the related interest obligations. The mortgage-backed securities still have excess credit coverage and are current on interest and principal payments. Based upon the Company s current evaluation of securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates and non-issuer-specific credit spreads and are not credit-related. In addition, the contractual terms of these securities do not permit these securities to be settled at a price less than their amortized cost.

 billion were related to securities that were rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. In all instances, there were no projected cash flow shortfalls to recover the full book value of the investments and the related interest obligations.

 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) 
 The Company records results from limited partnership investments on the equity method of accounting with changes in value reported through net investment income. The net investment income from limited partnerships is dependent upon the Company s share of the net asset values NAVs of interests underlying each limited partnership. Due to the timing of receiving financial information from these partnerships, the results are generally reported on a one month or quarter lag. If the Company determines there has been a significant decline in value of a limited partnership during this lag period, a loss will be recorded in the period in which the Company identifies the decline. 
 The Company had contractual commitments to invest up to an additional billion in limited partnerships and private placement loan securities at September 30, 2024. These commitments will be funded when called in accordance with the partnership and loan agreements, which have investment periods that expire, unless extended, through 2034. 
 In 2022, the Company entered into corporate-owned life insurance COLI policies, which are invested in debt and equity securities. The COLI policies are carried within other invested assets at the policy cash surrender value of billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Variable Interest Entities 
 The Company is engaged with various special purpose entities and other entities that are deemed to be VIEs, primarily as an investor through normal investment activities but also as an investment manager. A VIE is an entity that either has investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, such as simple majority kick-out rights, or lacks sufficient funds to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities. The Company performs ongoing qualitative assessments of its VIEs to determine whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and therefore is the primary beneficiary. The Company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest when it has both the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Based on the Company s assessment, if it determines it is the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates the VIE in the Company s consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not hold any securities for which it is the primary beneficiary. 
 The Company, through normal investment activities, makes passive investments in general and limited partnerships and other alternative investments. For these non-consolidated VIEs, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary as it has no ability to direct activities that could significantly affect the economic performance of the investments. The Company s maximum exposure to loss as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is limited to the total carrying value of billion and billion, respectively, which are included in general and limited

 billion and billion. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling billion whereby the Company is committed to fund these investments and may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. These investments are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in management. 
 In addition, the Company makes passive investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which the Company is not the manager. These investments are included in asset-backed securities, which includes collateralized loan obligations, and are classified as fixed maturities, available for sale. The Company has not provided financial or other support with respect to these investments other than its original investment. For these investments, the Company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to the relative size of the Company s investment in comparison to the principal amount of the structured securities issued by the VIEs, credit subordination that reduces the Company s obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits or the Company s inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. The Company s maximum exposure to loss on these investments is limited to the amount of the Company s investment.) ) ) Net realized gains (losses) from dispositions ) ) ) ) Equity securities, fair value Net realized gains (losses) from dispositions Gains (losses) from fair value adjustments ) ) ) Other invested assets Total net gains (losses) on investments ) ) ) )

 Premiums. Gross written premiums increased by 0.8 to 4.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a 67 million, or 2.1 , increase in our reinsurance business, partially offset by a 33 million, or 2.8 , decrease in our insurance business. The increase in reinsurance premiums was primarily due to property pro rata and property catastrophe excess of loss lines of business, partially offset by actions taken on our North America casualty business. The decrease in insurance premiums compared to the prior year period was primarily due to portfolio actions taken on accident and health and specialty casualty lines of business, partially offset by an increase in property/short tail business and other specialty business. Gross written premiums increased by 10.1 to 13.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a 1.1 billion, or 12.7 , increase in our reinsurance business and a 163 million, or 4.3 , increase in our insurance business. The increase in reinsurance premiums was primarily driven by property and casualty pro rata lines of business and property catastrophe excess of loss lines of business. The increase in insurance premiums was primarily due to property/short tail business, other specialty business and professional liability business, as well as continuing growth in international business across all lines. The increase in insurance premiums was partially offset by portfolio actions taken on accident and health and workers compensation lines. 
 Net written premiums decreased by 1.6 to 3.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in premiums ceded to Mt. Logan Re, Ltd. Mt. Logan Re cells within the Reinsurance segment for property catastrophe excess of loss line of business, and an increase in premium cession in Insurance driven by business mix and lower retention in certain lines of business. Net written premiums increased by 8.5 to 11.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The current year over prior year increase remained relatively consistent with the percentage increase in gross written premiums. 
 Premiums earned increased by 11.5 to 3.9 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.5 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Premiums earned increased by 14.2 to 11.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Premiums earned generally reflect the portion of net premiums written that was recognized as revenue for the period as the exposure period expires. The change in premiums earned relative to net written premiums is primarily the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period, whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the coverage period. 
 Other Income (Expense). We recorded other expense of 102 million and other income of 103 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recorded other expense of 48 million and other income of 61 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The changes were primarily the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We recognized foreign currency exchange expense of 102 million and foreign exchange currency income of 100 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recognized foreign currency exchange expense of 61 million and foreign currency exchange income of 51 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, the other expense incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes a 9 million pension plan curtailment gain recognized in the second quarter of 2024.

 Incurred losses and LAE increased by 15.0 to 2.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase of 203 million in current year attritional losses and an increase of 135 million in current year catastrophe losses. The increase in current year attritional losses was mainly due to the impact of the increase in underlying exposures, due to increased premiums earned. The current year catastrophe losses of 310 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to Hurricane Helene 81 million), Hurricane Beryl 67 million), Hurricane Debby 60 million), the 2024 European flood Boris 48 million) and the third quarter 2024 Calgary Alberta storms 41 million). The 175 million of current year catastrophe losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related primarily to Hurricane Idalia 42 million), the 2023 Morocco earthquake 40 million), the 2023 Hawaii wildfire 35 million), the 2023 Italy convective storm 28 million), the 2023 third quarter U.S. storms 20 million) and the 2023 Hans windstorm 10 million).

 Incurred losses and LAE increased by 15.5 to 7.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase of 730 million in current year attritional losses and an increase of 229 million in current year catastrophe losses. The increase in current year attritional losses was mainly due to the impact of the increase in underlying exposures due to increased premiums earned. The current year catastrophe losses of 546 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to Hurricane Helene 81 million), Hurricane Beryl 67 million), the 2024 Baltimore bridge collapse 62 million), Hurricane Debby 60 million), the 2024 European flood Boris 48 million), the 2024 Brazil Floods 41 million), the third quarter 2024 Calgary Alberta storms 41 million), the 2024 Germany floods 41 million), the 2024 Dubai floods 40 million) and the 2024 Taiwan earthquake 27 million). The 317 million of current year catastrophe losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related primarily to the 2023 Turkey earthquakes 95 million) the 2023 New Zealand storms 46 million), Hurricane Idalia 42 million), the 2023 Morocco earthquake 40 million), the 2023 Hawaii wildfire 35 million), the 2023 Italy convective storm 28 million), the 2023 third quarter U.S. storms 20 million), Typhoon Mawar 11 million) and the 2023 Hans windstorm 10 million). 
 
 Catastrophe losses and loss expenses typically have a material effect on our incurred losses and LAE results and can vary significantly from period to period. Losses from natural catastrophes contributed 7.9 percentage points to the combined ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 5.0 percentage points in the corresponding period of 2023, and 4.9 percentage points to the combined ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 3.2 percentage points in the corresponding period of 2023. 
 Refer to the Ratios section for loss ratio analysis discussion. 
 Commission, Brokerage, Taxes and Fees. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees increased by 9.9 to 826 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 752 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees increased by 14.2 to 2.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were primarily due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned and changes in the mix of business. Refer to the Ratios section for commission and brokerage ratio analysis discussion. 
 Other Underwriting Expenses. Other underwriting expenses were 236 million and 215 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Other underwriting expenses were 694 million and 620 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases in other underwriting expenses remained relatively consistent with the growth in premiums earned. Refer to the Ratios section for other underwriting expense ratio analysis discussion. 
 Corporate Expenses. Corporate expenses, which are general operating expenses that are not allocated to segments, were 25 million and 19 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 69 million and 55 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in Corporate expenses for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 are primarily due to information management related costs, including the acceleration of cybersecurity, corporate applications and infrastructure investments. 
 Interest, Fees and Bond Issue Cost Amortization Expense. Interest, fees and other bond amortization expense was 38 million and 34 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest, fees and other bond amortization expense was 112 million and 99 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases were mainly due to higher interest costs on the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York borrowing. Interest expense was also impacted by the movements in the floating interest rate related to the Company s outstanding fixed to floating rate long-term subordinated notes, which is reset quarterly, per the note agreement. The floating rate was 7.76 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 8.01 as of September 30, 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit). We had income tax expense of 68 million and 47 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had income tax expense of 275 million and 169 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The period over period increase in income tax expense is primarily a function of the geographic location of the Company s pre-tax income and the statutory tax rates in those jurisdictions. The effective tax rate ETR is primarily affected by tax-exempt investment income, foreign tax credits and dividends. Variations in the ETR generally result from changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income, including the impact of catastrophe losses and net capital gains (losses), among jurisdictions with different tax rates. 
 With the assent of the governor on December 27, 2023, the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act of 2023 the 2023 Act became law. Beginning in 2025, a 15 corporate income tax will be applicable to Bermuda businesses that are part of multinational enterprise groups with annual revenue of 750 million or more. Group s Bermuda entities will be subject to

 the new corporate income tax. The Company has evaluated The 2023 Act and has recorded 578 million of net deferred income tax benefits as of December 31, 2023. The net deferred income tax benefits relate primarily to a default provision in the law that allows for an Economic Transition Adjustment ETA ). The ETA allowed companies to establish deferred tax assets or liabilities related to the revaluation of intangible assets, excluding goodwill, and their other assets and liabilities, based on fair value as of September 30, 2023. 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA was enacted. We have evaluated the tax provisions of the IRA, the most significant of which are the corporate alternative minimum tax and the share repurchase excise tax, and do not expect the legislation to have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 
 Net Income (Loss). 
 Our net income was 509 million and 678 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our net income was 2.0 billion and 1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The period over period changes in net income were primarily driven by the financial component fluctuations explained above. 
 
 Ratios. 
 Our combined ratio increased by 1.6 points to 93.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 91.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased by 0.6 points to 90.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 90.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The current year increase is primarily due to higher catastrophe losses. Refer to the analysis of combined ratio components below. 
 The loss ratio component increased by 2.0 points to 66.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 63.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to a 135 million increase in catastrophe losses. The loss ratio component increased by 0.7 points to 63.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 62.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase of 229 million in current year catastrophe losses. 
 The commission and brokerage ratio components decreased to 21.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 21.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and remained consistent with 21.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 21.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The quarter over quarter variance was mainly due to changes in the mix of business. 
 The other underwriting expense ratios decreased to 6.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and decreased to 6.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for the three and nine months comparative period was mainly due to a higher earned premium base. 
 
 Shareholders Equity. 
 Shareholders equity increased by 2.1 billion to 15.3 billion at September 30, 2024 from 13.2 billion at December 31, 2023, principally as a result of 2.0 billion of net income, 521 million of unrealized appreciation on fixed income available for sale securities and equity method investments, net of tax, 45 million of net foreign currency translation adjustments, 26 million of share-based compensation transactions and 24 million of net benefit plan obligation adjustments, partially offset by 249 million of shareholder dividends and 200 million of share repurchases. 
 
 Consolidated Investment Results 
 
 Net Investment Income. 
 Net investment income increased by 22.2 to 496 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with net investment income of 406 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of an increase of 79 million in income from fixed maturity investments, an increase of 21 million in income from other alternative investments and an increase of 12 million in income from short-term investments, partially offset by a decline of 24 million in limited partnership income. Net investment income increased by 44.8 to 1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with investment income of 1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of an increase of 277 million of income from fixed maturity

 investments, an increase of 86 million in limited partnership income, an increase of 43 million from short-term investments and an increase of 43 million in income from other alternative investments. The limited partnership income primarily reflects changes in reported net asset values. As such, until these asset values are monetized and the resultant income is distributed, they are subject to volatile results of future increases or decreases in the asset value.

 Segment Results. 
 The Company operates through two operating segments: Reinsurance and Insurance. The Reinsurance segment writes worldwide property and casualty reinsurance and specialty lines of business, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies. Business is written in the U.S., Bermuda, and Ireland offices, as well as, through branches in Canada, Singapore, the United Kingdom UK and Switzerland. The Insurance segment writes property and casualty insurance directly and through brokers, including for surplus lines, and general agents within the U.S., Bermuda, Canada, Europe, Singapore and South America through its offices in the U.S., Australia, Bermuda, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Singapore, the UK, Ireland, and branches located in the UK, the Netherlands, France, Germany and Spain. The two segments are managed independently, but conform with corporate guidelines with respect to pricing, risk management, control of aggregate catastrophe exposures, capital, investments and support operations. 
 Our two operating segments each have executive leaders who are responsible for the overall performance of their respective segments and who are directly accountable to our chief operating decision maker CODM ), the Chief Executive Officer of Everest Group, Ltd., who is ultimately responsible for reviewing the business to assess performance, make operating decisions and allocate resources. We report the results of our operations consistent with the manner in which our CODM reviews the business. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company revised the classification and presentation of certain products related to its accident and health business within the segment groupings. These products have been realigned from within the Reinsurance segment to the Insurance segment to appropriately reflect how the business segments are managed. These changes have been reflected retrospectively. 
 The Company does not review and evaluate the financial results of its operating segments based upon balance sheet data. Management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting results. Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses. The Company measures its underwriting results using ratios, in particular, loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which, respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by premiums earned. Management has determined that these measures are appropriate and align with how the business is managed. We continue to evaluate our segments as our business evolves and may further refine our segments and financial performance measures. 
 The following discusses the underwriting results for each of our segments for the periods indicated.

 Premiums. Gross written premiums increased by 2.1 to 3.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by property pro rata and property catastrophe excess of loss lines of business, partially offset by actions taken on our North America casualty business. Gross written premiums increased by 12.7 to 9.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to property and casualty pro rata and property catastrophe excess of loss lines of business. 
 Net written premiums of 3.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 remained consistent with the 3.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, with the minimal decrease due to increased cessions to Mt. Logan cells emanating from the property catastrophe line of business. Net written premiums increased by 11.2 to 8.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was consistent with the percentage increase in gross written premiums. 
 Premiums earned increased by 14.5 to 3.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Premiums earned increased by 17.4 to 8.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Premiums earned generally reflect the portion of net premiums written that was recorded as revenues for the period as the exposure periods expire.

 Incurred losses increased by 17.5 to 1.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 184 million in current year attritional losses and an increase of 105 million in current year catastrophe losses. The increase in current year attritional losses was mainly related to the impact of the increase in premiums earned. The current year catastrophe losses of 270 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to Hurricane Helene 65 million), Hurricane Debby 59 million), Hurricane Beryl 56 million), the 2024 European flood Boris 46 million) and the 2024 third quarter Calgary Alberta storms 35 million).

 Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage expense increased by 10.4 to 710 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 643 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Commission and brokerage expense increased by 15.5 to 2.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were mainly due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned and changes in the mix of business. 
 Segment other underwriting expenses increased to 73 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 65 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Segment other underwriting expenses increased to 215 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 189 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were mainly due to increased expenditures supporting the increased premium volume of the segment.

 Premiums. Gross written premiums decreased by 2.8 to 1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in insurance premiums was primarily due to portfolio actions taken on accident and health and specialty casualty lines of business, partially offset by an increase in property/short tail business and specialty lines of business. Gross written premiums increased by 4.3 to 3.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in insurance premiums was primarily due to increases in property/short tail business and specialty lines of business, partially offset by portfolio actions taken on accident and health and workers compensation lines of business. 
 Net written premiums decreased by 5.4 to 830 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 878 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in premium cession driven by business mix and lower retention in certain lines of business. Net written premiums of 2.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, remained consistent with the 2.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Premiums earned increased by 2.9 to 948 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 920 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Premiums earned increased by 5.6 to 2.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period, whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the coverage period.

 Incurred losses and LAE increased by 8.3 to 642 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 593 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to an increase of 19 million in current year attritional losses and an increase of 30 million in current year catastrophe losses. The increase in current year attritional losses was primarily due to changes in mix of business. The 40 million of current year catastrophe losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to Hurricane Helene 16 million), Hurricane Beryl 11 million), the 2024 Jasper fires 6 million) and the third quarter 2024 Calgary Alberta storms 6 million). The 10 million of current year catastrophe losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to the 2023 third quarter U.S. storms 5 million) and the 2023 Hawaii wildfire 5 million). 
 
 Incurred losses and LAE increased by 7.8 to 1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to an increase of 88 million in current year attritional losses and an increase in current year catastrophe losses of 48 million. The increase in current year attritional losses was primarily due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned and changes in mix of business. The current year catastrophe losses of 60 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to Hurricane Helene 16 million), Hurricane Beryl 11 million), the 2024 second quarter U.S. convective storms 10 million), the 2024 Jasper fires 6 million), the third quarter 2024 Calgary Alberta storms 6 million) and the 2024

 Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage expenses increased by 6.8 to 116 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 108 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Commission and brokerage expenses increased by 7.3 to 344 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 320 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were mainly due to changes in the mix of business. 
 Segment other underwriting expenses increased to 163 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 151 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Segment other underwriting expenses increased to 478 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 431 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were mainly due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned and increased expenses related to the continued investment of the international insurance platform. 
 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Investments. Total investments were 40.5 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.8 billion compared to 35.7 billion at December 31, 2023. The rise in investments was primarily related to an increase in fixed maturities - available for sale due to an overall net purchase of 2.1 billion of fixed maturities - available for sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Company s limited partnership investments are comprised of limited partnerships that invest in private equity, private credit and private real estate. Generally, the limited partnerships are reported on a month or quarter lag. We receive annual audited financial statements for all the limited partnerships, which are prepared using fair value accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance. For the quarterly reports, the Company reviews the financial reports for any unusual changes in carrying value. If the Company becomes aware of a significant decline in value during the lag reporting period, the loss will be recorded in the period in which the Company identifies the decline.

 Reinsurance Recoverables. 
 Reinsurance recoverables for both paid and unpaid losses totaled 2.5 billion and 2.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, 416 million, or 16.5 , was receivable from Mt. Logan Re collateralized segregated accounts; 250 million, or 10.0 , was receivable from Munich Reinsurance America, Inc. and 187 million, or 7.4 was receivable from Endurance Specialty Holdings, Ltd. No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5 of our recoverables. 
 Loss and LAE Reserves. Gross loss and LAE reserves totaled 27.5 billion and 24.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Changes in premiums earned and business mix, reserve re-estimations, catastrophe losses and changes in catastrophe loss reserves and claim settlement activity all impact loss and LAE reserves by segment and in total. 
 Our carried loss and LAE reserves represent management s best estimate of our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We continuously re-evaluate our reserves, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss and claim experience. Changes in reserves resulting from such re-evaluations are reflected in incurred losses in the period when the re-evaluation is made. Our analytical methods and processes operate at multiple levels, including individual contracts, groupings of like contracts, classes and lines of business, internal business units, segments, accident years, legal entities, and in the aggregate. In order to set appropriate reserves, we make qualitative and quantitative analyses and judgments at these various levels. We utilize actuarial science, business expertise and management judgment in a manner intended to ensure the accuracy and consistency of our reserving practices. Management s best estimate is developed through collaboration with actuarial, underwriting, claims, legal and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees. Each segment reserve committee includes the participation of the relevant parties from actuarial, finance, claims and segment senior management and has the responsibility for recommending and approving management s best estimate. Reserves are further reviewed by Everest s Chief Reserving Actuary and senior management. The objective of this process is to determine a single best estimate viewed by management to be the best estimate of its ultimate loss liability. Nevertheless, our reserves are estimates and are subject to variation, which may be significant. 
 There can be no assurance that reserves for, and losses from, claim obligations will not increase in the future, possibly by a material amount. However, we believe that our existing reserves and reserving methodologies lessen the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 Asbestos and Environmental Exposures. Asbestos and Environmental A E exposures represent a separate exposure group for monitoring and evaluating reserve adequacy. The following table summarizes the outstanding loss reserves with respect to A E reserves on both a gross and net of retrocessions basis for the periods indicated. 
 At September 30, At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Gross reserves 213 247 Ceded reserves (10) (15) Net reserves 203 232 
 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) 
 With respect to asbestos only, at September 30, 2024, we had net asbestos loss reserves of 184 million, or 90.4 , of total net A E reserves, all of which was for assumed business. 
 Ultimate loss projections for A E liabilities cannot be accomplished using standard actuarial techniques. We believe that our A E reserves represent management s best estimate of the ultimate liability; however, there can be no assurance that ultimate loss payments will not exceed such reserves, perhaps by a significant amount. 
 Industry analysts use the survival ratio to compare the A E reserves among companies with such liabilities. The survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a company s current net reserves by the three-year average of annual paid losses. Hence, the survival ratio equals the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves if future loss payments were to continue at historical levels. Using this measurement, our net three-year asbestos survival ratio was 5.8 years at September 30, 2024. These metrics can be skewed by individual large settlements occurring in the prior three years and therefore may not be indicative of the timing of future payments. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Capital. Shareholders equity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 15.3 billion and 13.2 billion, respectively. Management s objective in managing capital is to ensure that the Company s overall capital level, as well as the capital levels of its operating subsidiaries, exceed the amounts required by regulators, the amount needed to support our current financial strength ratings from rating agencies and our own economic capital models. The Company s capital has historically exceeded these benchmark levels. 
 Our two main operating companies, Everest Reinsurance (Bermuda) Ltd. Bermuda Re and Everest Reinsurance Company Everest Re ), are regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority and the State of Delaware s Department of Insurance, respectively. Both regulatory bodies have their own capital adequacy models based on statutory capital as opposed to GAAP basis equity. Failure to meet the required statutory capital levels could result in various regulatory restrictions, including restrictions on business activity and the payment of dividends to their parent companies. 
 The regulatory targeted capital and the actual statutory capital for Bermuda Re and Everest Re were as follows: 
 Bermuda Re (1) 
 Everest Re (2) 
 At December 31, At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Regulatory targeted capital 2,669 2,217 4,242 3,353 Actual capital 3,711 2,759 6,963 5,553 
 (1) Regulatory targeted capital represents the target capital level from the applicable year's Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement calculation. 
 (2) Regulatory targeted capital represents 200 of the Risk Based Capital authorized control level calculation for the applicable year. 
 Our financial strength ratings, as determined by A.M. Best, Standard Poor s and Moody s, are important, as they provide our customers and investors with an independent assessment of our financial strength using a rating scale that provides for relative comparisons. We continue to possess significant financial flexibility and access to debt and equity markets as a result of our financial strength, as evidenced by the financial strength ratings assigned by independent rating agencies.

 We maintain our own economic capital models to monitor and project our overall capital, as well as the capital at our operating subsidiaries. A key input to the economic models is projected income, and this input is continually compared to actual results, which may require a change in the capital strategy. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 536,469 of our common shares at a cost of 200 million in the open market. During this period, we paid 249 million in common share dividends to adjust our capital position and enhance long-term expected returns to our shareholders. During 2023, we repurchased no shares in the open market and paid 288 million in dividends. On May 22, 2020, our existing Board authorization to purchase up to 30 million of our shares was amended to authorize the purchase of up to 32 million shares. As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased 31.3 million shares under this authorization. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of 2.00 per share. The common stock dividend was paid on September 27, 2024 for holders of record as of September 16, 2024. We paid 86 million in dividends during the third quarter of 2024. 
 We may continue, from time to time, to seek to retire portions of our outstanding debt securities through cash repurchases, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will be subject to and depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. 
 On May 19, 2023, the Company completed the public offering of 4,140,000 common shares, which included full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase an additional 540,000 common shares, at a public offering price of 360.00 per share. Total net proceeds from the public offering were 1,445 million, after underwriting discount and expenses. The Company s intent was to use the net proceeds from this offering for long-term reinsurance opportunity and continued build out of the global insurance business. 
 Liquidity. Our liquidity requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations. Positive cash flow results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for claims, with disbursements generally taking place over an extended period after the collection of premiums, sometimes a period of many years. Collected premiums are generally invested, prior to their use in such disbursements, and investment income provides additional funding for loss payments. Our net cash flows from operating activities were 4.2 billion and 3.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, these cash flows reflected net catastrophe loss payments of 506 million and 651 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net tax payments of 340 million and 185 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 If disbursements for losses and LAE, policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses were to exceed premium inflows, cash flow from reinsurance and insurance operations would be negative. The effect on cash flow from insurance operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income. Additionally, cash inflows from investment maturities of both short-term investments and longer term maturities are available to supplement other operating cash flows. We do not expect to supplement negative insurance operations cash flows with investment dispositions. 
 As the timing of payments for losses and LAE cannot be predicted with certainty, we maintain portfolios of long-term invested assets with varying maturities, along with short-term investments that provide additional liquidity for payment of claims. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held cash and short-term investments of 5.5 billion and 3.6 billion, respectively. Our short-term investments are generally readily marketable and can be converted to cash. In addition to these cash and short-term investments, at September 30, 2024, we had 1.0 billion of fixed maturity securities - available for sale maturing within one year or less, 8.7 billion maturing within one to five years and 8.0 billion maturing after five years. We believe that these fixed maturity securities, in conjunction with the short-term investments and positive cash flow from operations, provide ample sources of liquidity for the expected payment of losses and LAE in the near future. We do not anticipate selling a significant amount of securities to pay losses and LAE. At September 30, 2024, we had 223 million of net pre-tax unrealized depreciation related to fixed maturity - available for sale securities, comprised of 793 million of pre-tax unrealized depreciation and 570 million of pre-tax unrealized appreciation. 
 Management generally expects annual positive cash flow from operations, which reflects the strength of overall pricing. However, given catastrophic events observed in recent periods, cash flow from operations may decline and could become negative in the near term as significant claim payments are made related to the catastrophes. However, as indicated above, the Company has access to ample liquidity to settle its catastrophe claims and also may receive payments under the catastrophe bond program and the Mt. Logan Re collateralized reinsurance arrangement.

 In addition to our cash flows from operations and liquid investments, Everest Reinsurance Company Everest Re is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLBNY ), which allows Everest Re to borrow up to 10 of its statutory admitted assets. As of September 30, 2024, Everest Re had statutory admitted assets of approximately 29.2 billion which provides borrowing capacity of up to approximately 2.9 billion. As of September 30, 2024, Everest Re had 819 million of borrowings outstanding, which begin to expire in 2024. See Note 7 Credit Facilities to the Notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q for further details. 
 
 Market Sensitive Instruments. 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC Financial Reporting Release #48 requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments and other financial instruments (collectively, market sensitive instruments ). We do not generally enter into market sensitive instruments for trading purposes. 
 Our current investment strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity. Our mix of investments is adjusted periodically, consistent with our current and projected operating results and market conditions. The fixed maturity securities in the investment portfolio are comprised of available for sale and held to maturity securities. Additionally, we have invested in equity securities. 
 The overall investment strategy considers the scope of present and anticipated Company operations. In particular, estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment asset and liability transactions, together with our capital structure and other factors, are used to develop a net liability analysis. This analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for which our investments provide liquidity. This analysis is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation, duration and credit quality. The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period. 
 Interest Rate Risk. Our 42.1 billion investment portfolio at September 30, 2024 is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities, which are generally subject to interest rate risk and some foreign currency exchange rate risk, and some equity securities, which are subject to price fluctuations and some foreign exchange rate risk. The overall economic impact of the foreign exchange risks on the investment portfolio is partially mitigated by changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated liabilities and their associated income statement impact. 
 Interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity securities portfolio from a change in market interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, interest rate risk includes prepayment risk on the 6.9 billion of mortgage-backed securities in the 31.3 billion fixed maturity portfolio. Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life, and thus, the expected yield of the security. 
 The table below displays the potential impact of market value fluctuations and after-tax unrealized appreciation on our fixed maturity portfolio (including 3.9 billion of short-term investments) for the period indicated based on upward and downward parallel and immediate 100 and 200 basis point shifts in interest rates. For legal entities with a U.S. dollar functional currency, this modeling was performed on each security individually. To generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage-backed securities, changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account. For legal entities with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the effective duration of the involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the market value change under the various interest rate change scenarios. 
 Impact of Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points At September 30, 2024 -200 -100 0 100 200 (Dollars in millions) Total Fair Value 37,472 36,331 35,190 34,049 32,907 Fair Value Change from Base ) 6.5 3.2 (3.2) (6.5) Change in Unrealized Appreciation After-tax from Base ) 1,961 980 (980) (1,961) 
 We had 27.5 billion and 24.6 billion of gross reserves for losses and LAE as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These amounts are recorded at their nominal value, as opposed to present value, which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value of money. Since losses are paid out over a period of time, the present value of the reserves is less than the nominal value. As interest rates rise, the present value of the reserves decreases 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 and, conversely, as interest rates decline, the present value increases. These movements are similar to the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments held. While the difference between present value and nominal value is not reflected in our financial statements, our financial results will include investment income over time from the investment portfolio until the claims are paid. Our loss and loss reserve obligations have an expected duration of approximately 3.9 years, which is reasonably consistent with our fixed income portfolio. If we were to discount our loss and LAE reserves, net of ceded reserves, the discount would be approximately 4.4 billion resulting in a discounted reserve balance of approximately 20.8 billion, representing approximately 59.0 of the value of the fixed maturity investment portfolio funds. 
 Foreign Currency Risk. Foreign currency risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Each of our non-U.S./Bermuda operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines. Each non-U.S. operation may conduct business in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates. The primary foreign currency exposures for these non-U.S. operations are the Canadian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. We mitigate foreign exchange exposure by generally matching the currency and duration of our assets to our corresponding operating liabilities. In accordance with US GAAP guidance, the impact on the fair value of available for sale fixed maturities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in relation to functional currency, is reflected as part of other comprehensive income. Conversely, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in relation to functional currency, on other assets and liabilities is reflected through net income as a component of other income (expense). In addition, we translate the assets, liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities to the U.S. dollar. This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such change during the quarter covered by this report. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute resolution procedures, the outcomes of which will determine the Company s rights and obligations under insurance and reinsurance agreements. In some disputes, the Company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect funds owing to it. In other matters, the Company is resisting attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. These disputes arise from time to time and are ultimately resolved through both informal and formal means, including negotiated resolution, arbitration and litigation. In all such matters, the Company believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable. The Company considers the statuses of these proceedings when determining its reserves for unpaid loss and LAE. 
 Aside from litigation and arbitrations related to these insurance and reinsurance agreements, the Company is not a party to any other material litigation or arbitration.
