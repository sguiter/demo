Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words may, could, would, should, believe, expect, anticipate, plan, estimate, target, project, intend, foresee and similar expressions. These statements include, among others, statements regarding our expected business outlook, anticipated financial and operating results, our business strategy and means to implement the strategy, our objectives, the amount and timing of capital expenditures, the likelihood of our success in expanding our business, financing plans, budgets, working capital needs and sources of liquidity. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. 
 Forward-looking statements are only predictions and are not guarantees of performance. These statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our products, the expansion of product offerings geographically or through new marketing applications, the timing and cost of planned capital expenditures, competitive conditions and general economic conditions. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Forward-looking statements also involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, those results may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 general economic and geopolitical conditions in North America and elsewhere throughout the globe and construction and industrial activity in the markets where we operate in North America; 

our ability to forecast trends in our business accurately, and the impact of economic downturns and economic uncertainty on the markets we serve (including as a result of current uncertainty due to inflation and increasing interest rates); 

the impact of conditions in the global credit and commodity markets and their effect on construction spending and the economy in general; 

trends in oil and natural gas which could adversely affect the demand for our products and services; 

our inability to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business from our key suppliers on acceptable terms or at all, as a result of supply chain disruptions, insolvency, financial difficulties, supplier relationships or other factors; 

increased maintenance and repair costs as our fleet ages and decreases in our equipment s residual value; 

risks related to a global pandemic and similar health concerns, such as the scope and duration of the outbreak, government actions and restrictive measures implemented in response to the pandemic, material delays and cancellations of construction or infrastructure projects, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and other impacts to the business; 

our indebtedness; 

risks associated with the expansion of our business and any potential acquisitions we may make, including any related capital expenditures, or our ability to consummate such acquisitions; 

our ability to integrate any businesses or assets we acquire; 

competitive pressures; 

security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies, failure to protect personal information, compliance with data protection laws and other disruptions in our information technology systems; 

adverse weather events or natural disasters; 

risks related to climate change and climate change regulation; 

compliance with laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, corporate governance matters and tax matters, as well as any future changes to such laws and regulations; and 

other factors discussed under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), we are under no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after we file this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise. Investors, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider the above mentioned factors carefully in evaluating the forward looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results or performance.

For a more detailed discussion of some of the foregoing risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as other reports and registration statements filed by us with the SEC. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read with other cautionary statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other public filings. All of our annual, quarterly and current reports, and any amendments thereto, filed with or furnished to the SEC are available on our Internet website under the Investor Relations link.

Revenues by reporting segment are presented in Note 11 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe that the disaggregation of our revenues from contracts to customers as reflected above, coupled with further discussion below and the reporting segments in Note 11, depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. For further information related to our accounting for revenues pursuant to Topic 606 and Topic 842, see Significant Accounting Policies in Note 2 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

single customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for any of the periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We manage credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and other monitoring procedures. Pursuant to Topic 842 and Topic 326 for rental and non-rental receivables, respectively, we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects our estimate of our expected credit losses. Our allowance is estimated using a loss rate model based on delinquency. The estimated loss rate is based on our historical experience with specific customers, our understanding of our current economic circumstances, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and our own judgment as to the likelihood of ultimate payment based upon available data. Our largest exposure to doubtful accounts is our rental operations, which as discussed above is accounted for under Topic 842. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue under ASC 842 represents of our total revenues and an approximate corresponding percentage of our receivables, net and associated allowance for doubtful accounts. We perform credit evaluations of customers and establish credit limits based on reviews of our customers current credit information and payment histories. We believe our credit risk is somewhat mitigated by our geographically diverse customer base and our credit evaluation procedures. The actual rate of future credit losses, however, may not be similar to past experience. Our estimate of doubtful accounts could change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense as a percentage of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately and , respectively. We do not have material contract assets, impairment losses associated therewith, or material contract liabilities associated with contracts with customers. Our contracts with customers do not generally result in material amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue. We did not recognize material revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 that were included in the contract liability balance as of the beginning of such periods.

estimated useful life, earthmoving equipment over a estimated useful life with a salvage value, and material handling equipment over a estimated useful life. Attachments and other smaller type equipment are depreciated generally over a estimated useful life. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives and any salvage value assigned to rental equipment. Depreciation expense on rental equipment is reflected in rental depreciation in cost of revenues on the condensed consolidated statements of income. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs and property taxes are reflected in rental expenses in cost of revenues on the condensed consolidated statements of income. However, expenditures for additions or improvements that significantly extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized in the period incurred. When rental equipment is sold or disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any gains or losses are included in gross profit in the condensed consolidated statements of income. We receive individual offers for fleet on a continual basis, at which time we perform an analysis on whether or not to accept the offer. The rental equipment is not transferred to inventory under the held for sale model as the equipment is used to generate revenues until the equipment is sold. 
 on and is t expected to have an impact on our financial statements, but will result in expanded reportable segment disclosures. Income Taxes In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which should improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The ASU requires that public entities on an annual basis disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation, provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold and the following information about income taxes paid: the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes and the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by individual jurisdictions. Lastly, the amendments in this ASU require that entities disclose income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign and income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign. ASU 2023-09 becomes effective January 1, 2025 and is not expected to have an impact on our financial statements, but will result in expanded tax disclosures.

, we completed the acquisition of Lewistown Rentals Lewistown ), a Lewistown, Montana-based equipment rental business and three of its affiliated rental operations in Havre, Glasgow and Great Falls, Montana.

The level of goodwill that resulted from the Lewistown acquisition is primarily reflective of Lewistown s going-concern value, the value of assembled workforce, new customer relationships expected to arise from the acquisition and expected synergies from combining operations. We currently expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes. Acquisition costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were million included within selling, general and administrative SG A expenses on the condensed consolidated statement of income. Since our acquisition of Lewistown on May 1, 2024, significant amounts of equipment rental fleet have been moved between H E locations and the acquired locations, and it is impractical to reasonably estimate the amount of Lewistown revenues and earnings since the acquisition date. The assets and liabilities were recorded as of May 1, 2024 and the results of operations are included in the Company's consolidated results as of that date. Precision Rentals Effective , we completed the acquisition of Precision Rentals Precision ), an equipment rental company with a branch located in each of Arizona and Colorado. The acquisition expands our presence in both geographic markets. The aggregate cumulative cash consideration paid was approximately million, which includes million of fair value allocated to a noncompete agreement which is accounted for as a separate transaction from the net assets acquired in the business combination. The acquisition and related fees and expenses were funded from available cash and borrowings. Customary closing adjustments were finalized during the second quarter of 2024.

(d/b/a Giffin Equipment) Giffin ), an equipment rental company with three branches located in California. The acquisition expands our presence in the California market. The aggregate cash consideration paid was approximately million. The acquisition and related fees and expenses were funded from available cash and borrowings.

The level of goodwill that resulted from the Giffin acquisition is primarily reflective of Giffin s going-concern value, the value of assembled workforce, new customer relationships expected to arise from the acquisition and expected synergies from combining operations. We currently expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes. Acquisition costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were million included within SG A expenses on the condensed consolidated statement of income. Since our acquisition of Giffin on November 1, 2023, significant amounts of equipment rental fleet have been moved between H E locations and the acquired locations, and it is impractical to reasonably estimate the amount of Giffin revenues and earnings since the acquisition date. The assets and liabilities were recorded as of November 1, 2023 and the results of operations are included in the Company's consolidated results as of that date. Pro forma financial information (unaudited) We completed the Giffin acquisition effective November 1, 2023, the Precision acquisition effective January 1, 2024 and the Lewistown acquisition effective May 1, 2024; therefore, our reported condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 does not include Giffin, Precision or Lewistown and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 does not include Lewistown for the entire period.

For our Level 3 unobservable inputs, we calculate a discount rate for our manufacturing floor plans payable based on the U.S. prime rate plus the applicable margin on our Credit Facility. The discount rate is disclosed in the above table. The assets collateralized against the manufacturer flooring plans payable approximate its carrying value.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion summarizes the financial position of H E Equipment Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024, and its results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and should be read in conjunction with (i) the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and (ii) the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties (see discussion of Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Overview 
 Background 
 Founded in 1961 through our predecessor companies, we have been in the equipment services business for approximately 63 years and are one of the largest rental equipment companies in the nation. H E Equipment Services L.L.C. H E L.L.C. was formed in June 2002 through the business combination of Head Engquist, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gulf Wide Industries, L.L.C., and ICM Equipment Company L.L.C. In connection with our initial public offering in February 2006, we converted H E L.L.C. into H E Equipment Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (d/b/a H E Rentals ). 
 H E serves a diverse set of end markets in many high-growth geographies including branches throughout the Pacific Northwest, West Coast, Intermountain, Southwest, Gulf Coast, Southeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. As of September 30, 2024, we operated 157 branch locations across 32 states throughout the United States. 
 While focusing primarily on equipment rentals, we additionally engage in sales of rental equipment, sales of new equipment, parts sales and repair and maintenance services. The Company s construction rental fleet is among the industry s youngest with an equipment mix comprised of aerial work platforms, earthmoving, material handling, and other general and specialty lines. We are confident our operating experience and extensive infrastructure developed throughout our history as an integrated equipment services company qualified us to successfully transition to a pure-play rental company. This experience and infrastructure continues to provide us with a competitive advantage enabling us to broaden our industry expansion. Our workforce includes an outside and inside sales force for our rental operations and equipment sales, highly skilled service technicians, transportation drivers and regional and district managers. Our management, from the corporate level down to the branch store level, has extensive industry experience. We believe this allows us to provide specialized equipment knowledge, improve the effectiveness of our sales force and strengthen our customer relationships. In addition, we operate our day-to-day business on a branch basis, which allows us to more closely service our customers, fosters management accountability at local levels and strengthens our local and regional relationships. 
 Effective November 1, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Giffin Equipment Giffin ), a privately-held equipment rentals company with three branch locations in California. 
 Effective January 1, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Precision Rentals Precision ), a privately-held equipment rentals company with a branch location in each of Arizona and Colorado. 
 Effective May 1, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Lewistown Rentals Lewistown ), a privately-held equipment rentals company with four branch locations in Montana. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Item 7, included in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, presents the accounting estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows, and which require complex management judgment and assumptions, or involve uncertainties. There have been no significant changes to these critical accounting estimates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our critical accounting estimates include, among others, useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment, acquisition accounting, goodwill, and income taxes. 
 Information regarding our other significant accounting estimates is included in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 21 

Business Segments 
 We have four reportable segments because we derive our revenues from four business activities: (1) equipment rentals; (2) sales of rental equipment; (3) sales of new equipment; (4) parts, service and other revenues. Our primary segment is equipment rentals. These segments are based upon how we allocate resources and assess performance. We revised our reportable segments by aggregating parts sales and service revenues into one segment during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 due to revised internal reporting provided to our Chief Operating Decision Maker. For additional information about our business segments, see Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Equipment Rentals. Our rental operation is our principal focus and we primarily rent our core types of construction and industrial equipment (aerial work platforms, earthmoving equipment, material handling equipment and other general and specialty lines). We have a well-maintained rental fleet and a dedicated sales team. We actively manage the size, quality, age and composition of our rental fleet based on our analysis of key measures such as time utilization (a reflection of equipment usage based on customer demand and calculated as our fleet s original equipment cost on-rent divided by our fleet s original equipment cost, averaged over the time period), rental rate trends and targets, rental equipment dollar utilization, and maintenance and repair costs, which we closely monitor. Given the use of these measures by management, we believe that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by the disclosure of the measures as it allows investors to view performance from management s perspective. Additionally, we maintain fleet quality through quality control inspections and our parts and services operations. 

Sales of Rental Equipment. Our rental equipment sales are generated primarily from sales from our rental fleet. Sales of our rental fleet equipment allow us to manage the size, quality, composition and age of our rental fleet, and provide us with a profitable distribution channel for the disposal of rental equipment. 

Sales of New Equipment. We sell equipment through a professional sales force. Sales of new equipment may be impacted by the availability of equipment from the manufacturer. 

Parts, Service and Other Revenues. Our parts business provides parts to our own rental fleet and sells parts for the equipment we sell. In order to provide timely parts and services support to our rental fleet as well as our customers, we maintain a parts inventory. Our services operation provides maintenance and repair services to our own rental fleet and for our customers equipment at our facilities as well as at our customers locations. Our other revenues relate to costs primarily related to ancillary charges associated with equipment maintenance and repair services. 

Revenue Sources 
 We generate our total revenues from our four business activities and our other equipment support activities. Equipment rentals accounts for the majority of our total revenues. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of our total revenues, approximately 82.0 were attributable to equipment rentals, 10.0 were attributable to sales of rental equipment, 3.0 were attributable to sales of new equipment, 5.0 were attributable to parts, service and other revenues. 
 The equipment that we rent, sell and service is principally used in the construction industry, as well as by companies for commercial and industrial uses such as plant maintenance and turnarounds, and in the petrochemical and energy sectors. As a result, our total revenues are affected by several factors including, but not limited to, the demand for and availability of rental equipment, rental rates and other competitive factors, the demand for used and new equipment, the level of construction and industrial activities, spending levels by our customers, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions, the price of oil and other commodities and general economic conditions. 
 Equipment Rentals. Our rental operation primarily represents revenues from renting owned equipment of our core types of construction and industrial equipment (aerial work platforms, earthmoving equipment, material handling equipment and other general and specialty lines). We primarily account for these rental contracts as operating leases. We recognize revenue from equipment rentals in the period earned, regardless of the timing of billing to customers. A rental contract includes rates for daily, weekly or monthly use, and rental revenues are earned on a daily basis as rental contracts remain outstanding. We have a well-maintained rental fleet and we actively manage the size, quality, age and composition of our rental fleet. 
 Sales of Rental Equipment. We generate the majority of our rental equipment sales revenues by selling equipment from our rental fleet. 
 Sales of New Equipment . Our sales of new equipment operation sells equipment across all of our core categories of equipment. 
 Parts, Service and Other. We primarily generate revenues from the sale of parts for equipment that we rent or sell. We primarily derive our services revenues from maintenance and repair services for equipment that we rent or sell and from customers' owned equipment. Our other revenues relate primarily to ancillary charges associated with equipment maintenance and repair services. 
 22 

Principal Costs and Expenses 
 Our largest expenses are rental expenses, rental depreciation, rental other expenses, the costs associated with the rental equipment we sell, the costs to purchase new equipment and costs associated with parts sales and services, all of which are included in cost of revenues. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total cost of revenues was 624.9 million. Our operating expenses consist principally of selling, general and administrative expenses SG A ). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our SG A expenses were 338.6 million. In addition, we have interest expense primarily related to our debt instruments. Operating expenses and all other income and expense items below the gross profit line of our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income are not generally allocated to our reportable segments. 
 We are also subject to federal and state income taxes. Future income tax examinations by state and federal agencies could result in additional income tax expense based on potential outcomes of such matters. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Rental Depreciation. Depreciation of rental equipment represents the depreciation costs attributable to rental equipment. Estimated useful lives vary based upon type of equipment. Generally, we depreciate aerial work platforms over a ten year estimated useful life, earthmoving equipment over a five year estimated useful life with a 25 salvage value, and material handling equipment over a seven year estimated useful life. Attachments and other smaller type equipment are depreciated over a three year estimated useful life. We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to rental equipment. 
 Rental Expense. Rental expense represents the costs associated with rental equipment, including, among other things, the cost of repairing and maintaining our rental equipment, property taxes on our fleet and other miscellaneous costs of owning rental equipment. 
 Rental Other. Rental other expenses consist primarily of equipment support activities that we provide our customers in connection with renting equipment, such as hauling services, damage waiver policies, environmental fees and other recovery fees. 
 Sales of Rental Equipment. Cost of rental equipment sold primarily consists of the net book value of rental equipment sold from our rental fleet. 
 Sales of New Equipment. Cost of new equipment sold primarily consists of the equipment cost of the new equipment that is sold. 
 Parts, Service and Other. Cost of parts sales represents costs attributable to the sale of parts used in the maintenance and repair of equipment on-rent by customers and directly to customers for their owned equipment. Cost of services revenues represents costs attributable to service provided for the maintenance and repair of equipment on-rent by customers and of customer-owned equipment. Our other expenses include costs associated with ancillary charges associated with equipment maintenance and repair services . 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Our SG A expenses include sales and marketing expenses, payroll and related benefit costs, including stock compensation expense, insurance expenses, professional fees, rent and other occupancy costs, property and other taxes, administrative overhead, acquisition costs, depreciation associated with property and equipment (other than rental equipment) and amortization expense associated with intangible assets. These expenses are not generally allocated to our reportable segments. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the periods presented represents the interest on our outstanding debt instruments, including aggregate amounts outstanding under our revolving 750.0 million senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility ), our 1.25 billion, 3.875 senior unsecured notes due 2028 (the Senior Unsecured Notes and finance lease obligations. Non-cash interest expense related to the amortization cost of deferred financing costs and the accretion/amortization of note discount/premium are also included in interest expense. 
 Principal Cash Flows 
 We generate cash primarily from our operating activities and, historically, we have used cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under the Credit Facility as the primary sources of funds to purchase new equipment and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, growth and expansion opportunities (see also Liquidity and Capital Resources below). The management of our working capital is closely tied to operating cash flows, as working capital can be impacted by, among other things, our accounts receivable activities, the level of equipment inventory, which may increase or decrease in response to current and expected demand, and the size and timing of our trade accounts payable payment cycles. 
 23 

Rental Fleet 
 A substantial portion of our total assets is our rental fleet equipment. The net book value of our rental equipment at September 30, 2024 was 1.9 billion, or approximately 66.5 of our total assets. Our rental fleet as of September 30, 2024 consisted of 63,727 units having an original acquisition cost (which we define as the cost originally paid to manufacturers) of 2.9 billion. As of September 30, 2024, our rental fleet composition was as follows (dollars in millions):

Determining the optimal age and mix for our rental fleet equipment is subjective and requires considerable estimates and judgments by management. We constantly evaluate the mix, age and quality of the equipment in our rental fleet in response to current economic and market conditions, competition and customer demand as part of our fleet management strategy. The mix and age of our rental fleet, as well as our cash flows, are impacted by sales of rental equipment, which are influenced by used equipment pricing at the retail and secondary auction market levels, the demand for our rental fleet, the availability of new equipment and the capital expenditures to acquire fleet. In making equipment acquisition decisions, we evaluate current economic and market conditions, competition, manufacturers availability, pricing and return on investment over the estimated useful life of the specific equipment, among other things. As a result of our in-house service capabilities and extensive maintenance program, our rental fleet is well-maintained. 
 The original acquisition cost of our gross rental fleet increased by approximately 156.0 million, or 5.6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023. The average age of our rental fleet equipment increased by approximately 1.1 months for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023. Our average rental rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 1.5 higher than the same period last year (see further discussion on rental rates in Results of Operations below). 
 The rental equipment mix among our core product lines for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was largely consistent with that of the prior year comparable period as a percentage of total units available for rent and as a percentage of original acquisition cost. 
 Principal External Factors that Affect our Businesses 
 We are subject to a number of external factors that may adversely affect our businesses. These factors, and other factors, are discussed below and under the heading Forward-Looking Statements, and in Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Economic downturns. The demand for our products is dependent on the general economy, which is in turn affected by geopolitical conditions, the stability of the global credit markets, inflationary pressures, increasing interest rates, the conditions of the industries in which our customers operate or serve, and other factors. Downturns in the general economy or in the construction and industrial markets, as well as adverse credit market conditions, can cause demand for our products to materially decrease. Our operations are also impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints. We have experienced and may continue to experience inflationary pressures, including but not limited to cost increases related to equipment, fuel and hauling expenses that we attempt to mitigate through pricing and productivity initiatives. 

Spending levels by customers. Rentals and sales of equipment to the construction industry and to industrial companies constitute a significant portion of our total revenues. As a result, we depend upon customers in these businesses and their ability and willingness to rent or buy equipment. Accordingly, our business is impacted by fluctuations in customers spending levels and seasonality, as discussed in Item 1 Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Adverse weather. Adverse weather in a geographic region in which we operate may depress demand for equipment in that region. Our equipment is primarily used outdoors and, as a result, prolonged adverse weather conditions may prohibit our customers from continuing their work projects. Adverse weather also has a seasonal impact in parts of our Intermountain region, particularly in the winter months. 

24 

Regional and Industry-Specific Activity and Trends. Expenditures by our customers may be impacted by the overall level of construction activity in the markets and regions in which they operate, the price of oil and other commodities, the price of materials, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, interest rates and other general economic trends impacting the industries in which our customers and end users operate. As our customers adjust their activity and spending levels in response to these external factors, our rentals and sales of equipment to those customers will be impacted. 

Climate Change and ESG Regulations. Our facilities and operations are subject to comprehensive and frequently changing federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. While we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or competitive position as a result of our efforts to comply with such requirements, new or more stringent laws or regulations regarding in environmental and worker health and safety laws could affect our operations and increase our operational and compliance expenditures. It is also possible that liabilities from newly-discovered non-compliance or contamination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of such factors, see Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Total Revenues . Our total revenues were 384.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 400.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 15.8 million, or 4.0 . Revenues of our business activities are further discussed below. 
 Equipment Rental Revenues . Our total revenues from equipment rentals for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 10.4 million, or 3.3 , to 326.2 million from 315.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increased equipment rental revenues was primarily due to our larger fleet as compared to the prior year. See Rentals and Rentals Other below for additional information. 
 Rentals : Rental revenues increased 7.8 million, or 2.8 , to 288.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 280.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Rental revenues from other rentals increased 8.4 million and aerial work platform equipment increased 4.0 million. Partially offsetting these increases, rental revenues from our earthmoving equipment decreased 2.8 million and material handling equipment decreased 1.8 million. Our average rental rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.1 compared to the same three months last year and decreased 0.6 from the three months ended June 30, 2024. Our average rental rates do not include the impact of acquisitions completed within the last twelve months. Rental equipment dollar utilization (annual rental revenues divided by the average original rental fleet equipment costs) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 39.4 compared to 41.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 2.1 . The decrease in comparative rental equipment dollar utilization was the result of a decrease in rental equipment time utilization and a decrease in equipment rental rates. Rental equipment time utilization as a percentage of original equipment cost was 67.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 70.0 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease 
 25 

of 2.4 . The decrease in rental equipment time utilization as a percentage of original equipment cost was largely reflective of the increase in fleet size. 
 Rentals Other: Our rentals other revenues consist primarily of equipment support activities that we provide to customers in connection with renting equipment, such as hauling charges, damage waiver policies, environmental and other recovery fees. Rental other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 38.1 million compared to 35.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 2.6 million, or 7.2 . This increase was primarily related to increased rental revenues discussed above. 
 Sales of Rental Equipment Revenues . Our sales of rental equipment decreased 24.9 million, or 47.3 , to 27.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 52.7 million for the same three months in 2023. This decrease is reflective of our ongoing fleet management strategy. Sales of earthmoving rental equipment decreased 16.7 million and material handling rental equipment decreased 7.2 million. Offsetting this decrease, sales of aerial work platform rental equipment increased 1.1 million. 
 Sales of New Equipment Revenues . Our sales of new equipment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.4 million, or 11.2 , to 14.1 million from 12.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sales of new material handling equipment increased 5.5 million as we capitalized on improved product line availability. Sales of aerial work platform equipment increased 1.2 million while sales of other equipment decreased 4.9 million. 
 Parts, Service and Other Revenues . Our parts, service and other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.7 million, or 14.0 , to 16.8 million from 19.5 million for the same three months last year.

We recorded an income tax expense of 34.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an income tax expense of 41.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 27.6 compared to 26.2 for the same period in 2023. Based on available evidence, both positive and negative, we believe it is more likely than not that our federal deferred tax assets at September 30, 2024 are fully realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flow From Operating Activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net cash provided by our operating activities was 366.2 million. Our reported net income of 90.2 million, when adjusted for non-cash income and expense items, such as depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, net amortization (accretion) of note discount (premium), provision for losses on accounts receivable, provision for inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation expense and net gains on the sale of long-lived assets, provided positive cash flows of 394.8 million. These cash flows from operating activities were also positively impacted by a 6.3 million increase in accrued expenses payable and other liabilities and a 2.9 million decrease in inventories driven by the classification of rental equipment at the time of purchase. Partially offsetting these positive cash flows were a 27.3 million decrease in accounts payable, a 5.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a 3.8 million increase in receivables and a 1.0 million decrease in manufacturing flooring plans payable. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net cash provided by our operating activities was 276.5 million.

Dividends paid totaled 30.0 million, or 0.825 per common share, and treasury stock purchases totaled 6.1 million. Payments on deferred financing costs related to the amended and restated credit facility totaled 4.9 million. 
 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 On December 14, 2020, we completed the offering of our Senior Unsecured Notes of 1.25 billion. No principal payments on the Senior Unsecured Notes are due until their scheduled maturity date of December 15, 2028. 
 The Senior Unsecured Notes were issued by H E Equipment Services, Inc. (the parent company) and are guaranteed by GNE Investments, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Great Northern Equipment, Inc., H E Equipment Services (California), LLC, H E California Holding, Inc., H E Equipment Services (Midwest), Inc., H E Equipment Services (Mid-Atlantic), Inc. and H E Finance Corp (collectively, the guarantor subsidiaries). The guarantees, made on a joint and several basis, are full and unconditional (subject to subordination provisions and subject to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by each guarantor will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws). There are no restrictions on H E Equipment Services, Inc. s ability to obtain funds from the guarantor subsidiaries by dividend or loan. There are no registration rights associated with the notes or the subsidiary guarantees. 
 Senior Secured Credit Facility 
 We and our subsidiaries are parties to a 750.0 million senior secured credit facility (our Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as administrative agent, and the lenders named therein. At September 30, 2024, we had 276.3 million borrowed under the Credit Facility and we could borrow up to 461.3 million, which with cash on hand amounted to a liquidity position of 472.4 million. We did not have any covenant violations related to the Credit Facility. At October 22, 2024, we had borrowings of 269.0 million outstanding under our Credit Facility leaving us with borrowing availability of 468.7 million, as a result of 12.3 million letters of credit outstanding under the facility. 
 Cash Requirements Related to Operations 
 Our principal sources of liquidity have been from cash provided by operating activities and the revenue from our rental operations and sales of rental fleet and new equipment, proceeds from the issuance of debt, and borrowings available under the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held balances of cash totaling 11.1 million, while as of December 31, 2023, the Company held balances of cash totaling 8.5 million. Our principal uses of cash historically have been to fund operating activities and working capital, purchases of rental fleet equipment, inventory and property and equipment, opening new branch locations, fund payments due under facility operating leases and manufacturer flooring plans payable, and to meet debt service requirements. In the future, we may pursue additional strategic acquisitions and seek to open new branch locations. 
 The amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions and growth prospects. In response to changing economic conditions, we believe we have the flexibility to modify our capital expenditures by adjusting them (either up or down) to match our actual performance. The condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include the payments for purchases of rental fleet, but does not reflect gross rental fleet capital expenditures which include items such as non-cash components. Our gross rental fleet capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 327.8 million and 595.2 million, respectively. This decrease in rental fleet capital expenditures reflects the normalization of fleet purchasing in the current year as compared to the prior year. Our gross property and equipment capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 93.9 million and 55.4 million, respectively. The increase in gross property and equipment capital expenditures in the current year as compared to the prior year is attributable to branch expansion. 
 To service our debt, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness (including the Credit Facility, the Senior Unsecured Notes and our other indebtedness), will depend upon our future operating performance and the availability of borrowings under the Credit Facility and/or other debt and equity financing alternatives available to us, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and conditions in the global credit and capital markets, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations and given the current state of the capital markets, we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under the Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, both in the short-term (over the next 12 months) and beyond. As noted earlier, at September 30, 2024, we had cash on hand of 11.1 million. At September 30, 2024, we had 
 31 

available borrowings of 461.3 million, net of 12.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. At October 22, 2024, we had 468.7 million of available borrowings under the Credit Facility, net of 12.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. 
 Quarterly Dividend 
 On August 13, 2024, the Company announced a quarterly dividend of 0.275 per share to stockholders of record, which was paid on September 13, 2024, totaling approximately 10.1 million. The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends; however, the declaration of any subsequent dividends is discretionary and will be subject to a final determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after its review of, among other things, business and market conditions. 
 Contractual and Commercial Commitments 
 There have been no material changes from the information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates since interest expense on the Credit Facility is currently calculated based upon (a) the Base Rate plus an applicable margin of 0.25 to 0.75 , depending on the Average Availability (as defined in the Credit Facility), in the case of index rate revolving loans and (b) SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment and an applicable margin of 1.25 to 1.75 , depending on the Average Availability (as defined in the Credit Facility), in the case of SOFR revolving loans. 
 With the exception of the above, there have been no significant changes in our exposure to market risk during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For an additional discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management s Quarterly Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or furnishes under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure. 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively) have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our current disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 The design of any system of control is based upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated objectives under all future events, no matter how remote, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may not deteriorate. Because of its inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 From time to time, we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business.

We are exposed to various claims relating to our business, including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and self-insured retentions, or self-insurance. Losses that exceed our deductibles and self-insured retentions are insured through various commercial lines of insurance policies.
