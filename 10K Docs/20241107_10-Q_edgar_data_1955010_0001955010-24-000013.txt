 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Some of the statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements because they relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about OHA Senior Private Lending Fund (U) LLC (the Company , we , us or our ), our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Forward-looking statements may include, among other things, statements as to our future operating results, our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies, the impact of the investments that we expect to make, the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives, our expected financings and investments, the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital, and the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies. Words such as expect, anticipate, target, goals, project, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, continue, forecast, may, will, would, should, potential, variations of such words, and similar expressions indicate a forward-looking statement, although not all forward-looking statements include these words. Readers are cautioned that the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions, are not guarantees of future performance, and are subject to risks, events, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.

Other factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially include, but are not limited to, changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, risks associated with possible disruption due to terrorism in our operations or the economy generally, the impact of geo-political conditions, including revolution, insurgency, terrorism or war and future changes in laws or regulations and conditions in our operating areas. 
 Any forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts, information and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless we are required to do so by law. Investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report.

Substantial additional fees and expenses may also be charged by OHA Private Credit Advisors II, L.P., in its capacity as the administrator to the Company (the Administrator ). 
 Management Fee 
 The management fee is payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of of the value of our net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month. For purposes of the Advisory Agreement, net assets means our total assets (which does not include unfunded capital commitments) less the fair value of our liabilities, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, management fees were million and million, respectively, of which were waived. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, management fees were million and million, respectively, of which were waived. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, remained payable related to the base management fee accrued in management fee payable on the statement of assets and liabilities. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee consists of components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of our income and a portion is based on a percentage of our capital gains, each as described below. 
 Incentive Fee Based on Income 
 The first part of the incentive fee is based on income, whereby the Company pays the Adviser annually in arrears of its Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (as defined below) for the relevant calendar year subject to a annualized hurdle rate (the Hurdle Rate ). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means dividends, cash interest or other distributions or other cash income and any third-party fees received from portfolio companies (such as upfront fees, commitment fees, origination fee, amendment fees, ticking fees and break-up fees, as well as prepayments premiums, but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance and fees earned by the Adviser or an affiliate in its capacity as an administrative agent, syndication agent, collateral agent, loan servicer or other similar capacity) accrued during the month, minus operating expenses for the month (including the management fee, taxes, any expenses payable under the Advisory Agreement and an administration agreement with our administrator (the Administration Agreement ), any expense of securitizations, and interest expense or other financing fees and any distributions paid on preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee and Member servicing and/or distribution fees). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind PIK interest and zero-coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 The Company pays the Adviser an incentive fee with respect to the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as follows: 
 No incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar year in which the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns does not exceed an annualized Hurdle Rate of ; 
 of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than in any calendar year. This portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than is referred to as the catch-up. The catch-up is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a Hurdle

 in any calendar year; and 
 of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds in any calendar year, which reflects that once the Hurdle Rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns is paid to the Adviser. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, income based incentive fees (before waivers) were million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, income based incentive fees were million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million related to the income based incentive fee had accrued and remained payable on the statement of assets and liabilities, respectively. 
 Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains 
 The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. The amount payable equals: 
 of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 There were capital gains based incentive fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, remained payable related to the capital gains based incentive fee accrued in capital gains incentive fee payable on the statement of assets and liabilities.

 Overview 
 The Company is a Delaware limited liability company formed on June 27, 2022. We are an externally managed, closed-end, diversified management investment company that elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. OHA Private Credit Advisors II, L.P. is the investment adviser of the Company. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, as amended (the Code ), beginning with our fiscal year (or period) ending December 31, 2022. We were formed to make investments and generate returns in the form of current income and long-term capital appreciation. 
 
 The Company s investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, predominately in the form of current income, with select investments exhibiting the ability to capture long-term capital appreciation with a focus on downside protection. The Company seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in the non-investment grade credit markets in North America and Europe, with a primary focus on direct lending in the United States. The Company will target investments in well-established, larger companies generally with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA of 75 million or greater Larger Borrowers ), consistent with OHA s investment history and proven investment process. We believe that credit profiles of Larger Borrowers generally benefit from greater business diversification, stronger market positions, experienced management teams and a greater ability to navigate challenging markets. 
 Subject to any restrictions imposed under the 1940 Act, any related RIC asset diversification requirements and any guidelines and limitations set forth herein, the Company s investments are expected to primarily consist of senior secured first lien loans and unitranche loans but may include second lien loans or other assets. The Company will seek target position sizes of 2 to 5 of NAV and seek to allocate (a) greater than or equal to 80 of NAV to first lien and unitranche loans and (b) less than or equal to 20 of NAV to second lien loans. The Company s investment mandate is structured so as to allow for co-investment across OHA s entire platform, based on existing SEC exemptive relief under Rule 17d-1 under the 1940 Act and any additional SEC exemptive relief obtained in the future. 

Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on senior secured loans and securities of private U.S. companies. The level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to private companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 
 Revenues 
 
 We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies. Our senior and subordinated debt investments are expected to bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. As of September 30, 2024, 99.8 of our debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio were at floating rates. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with transactions. Original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 
 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs described below.

Table of Contents 

 Risk Ratings Definitions 
 Risk Rating 1 - Investments with a score of 1 contain the lowest amount of risk in our portfolio. Borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. 
 Risk Rating 2 - Investments with a score of 2 contain an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. Borrower is performing in-line with expectations, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. Investments are assigned a score of 2 at the time of origination or acquisition. 
 
 Risk Rating 3 - Investments with a score of 3 mean the borrower is performing below expectations and that the loan s risk has increased somewhat since origination or acquisition. 
 
 Risk Rating 4 - Investments with a score of 4 mean the borrower is performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased materially since origination or acquisition. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 120 days past due). 
 
 Risk Rating 5 - Investments with a score of 5 mean the borrower is performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent.

If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. 
 Other Expenses 
 Organization costs and offering costs include expenses incurred in our initial formation and offering. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, valuation, other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. Administrative service expenses represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers, their respective staff and other non-investment professionals that perform duties for us. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, our sub-administrator, and other costs.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Administrator and Adviser may delegate its obligations under these agreements to an affiliate or to a third party and we reimburse the Administrator and Adviser for any services performed for us by such affiliate or third party. 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our Members in each taxable year generally at least 90 of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for distributions paid), and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our Members, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we incurred no U.S. federal excise tax. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 0.1 million of U.S. federal excise tax. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we incurred no U.S. federal excise tax.

The primary uses of our cash are investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser and Administrator or its affiliates), and cash distributions to the holders of our Shares. 
 There were no outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. 
 As of September 30, 2024, cash taken together with our uncalled capital commitments of 124.2 million, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 54.0 million in cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used approximately 96.9 million in cash for operating activities, primarily due to investment purchases of 182.1 million partially offset by sales and principal repayments of 80.2 million. Cash provided by financing activities was approximately 33.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily due to proceeds from issuance of common shares of 60.8 million, offset by 26.7 million of distributions paid. 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 18.1 million in cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 234.0 million in cash for operating activities, primarily due to a decrease in investments payable of 117.9 million and investment purchases of 134.9 million, offset by sales and principal repayments of 13.1 million. Cash provided by financing activities was 64.6 million during the period, which was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of additional Shares. 
 Equity 
 Subscriptions and Drawdowns 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 44,724,135 and 38,954,613, respectively, of Shares issued and outstanding with a par value of 0.01 per Share. 
 We have entered into subscription agreements with investors providing for the private placement of our Shares. Under the terms of the subscription agreements, each investor is required to fund drawdowns to purchase our Shares up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitment on an as-needed basis each time our Adviser delivers a capital call notice to such investor.

Distributions 
 
 We expect to pay quarterly distributions. Any distributions we make will be at the discretion of our Board, considering factors such as our earnings, cash flow, capital needs and general financial condition and the requirements of Delaware law. As a result, our distribution rates and payment frequency may vary from time to time.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. 
 Investments at Fair Value 
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period. 
 The Company is required to report its investments for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. The Company values its investments in accordance with ASC Topic 820, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. ASC Topic 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainties of valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a ready market for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. 
 Investments that are listed or traded on an exchange and are freely transferable are valued at either the closing price (in the case of securities and futures) or the mean of the closing bid and offer (in the case of options) on the principal exchange on which the investment is listed or traded. Investments for which other market quotations are readily available will typically be valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, the Company will utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Where it is possible to obtain reliable, independent market quotations from a third party vendor, the Company will use these quotations to determine the value of its investments. The Company utilizes mid-market pricing (i.e., mid-point of average bid and ask prices) to value these investments. The Adviser obtains these market quotations from independent pricing services, if available; otherwise from one or more broker quotes. To assess the continuing appropriateness of pricing sources and methodologies, the Adviser regularly performs price verification procedures and issues challenges as necessary to independent pricing services or brokers, and any differences are reviewed in accordance with the valuation procedures. The Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. 
 Where prices or inputs are not available or, in the judgment of the Adviser, not reliable, valuation approaches based on the facts and circumstances of the particular investment will be utilized. Securities that are not publicly traded or for which market prices are not readily available, as will be the case for a substantial portion of the Company s investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser as the Company s valuation designee under Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, pursuant to the Company s valuation policy, and under the oversight of the Board, based on, among other things, the input of independent valuation firms retained by the Company to review the Company s investments. These valuation approaches involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments complexity. 
 With respect to the quarterly valuation of investments, the Company undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments for which reliable market quotations are not readily available as of the last calendar day of each quarter, which includes, among other procedures, the following: 
 The valuation process begins with each investment being preliminarily valued by the Adviser s valuation team in consultation with the Adviser s investment professionals responsible for each portfolio investment; 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 In addition, independent valuation firms retained by the Company prepare quarter-end valuations of each such investment that was (i) originated or purchased prior to the first calendar day of the quarter and (ii) is not a de minimis investment, as determined by the Adviser. The independent valuation firms provide a final range of values on such investments to the Adviser. The independent valuation firms also provide analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations; 
 The Adviser s valuation committee with respect to the Company (the Valuation Committee reviews each valuation recommendation to confirm they have been calculated in accordance with the Company s valuation policy and compares such valuations to the independent valuation firms valuation ranges to ensure the Adviser s valuations are reasonable; 
 The Adviser s Valuation Committee then determines fair value marks for each of the Company s portfolio investments; and 
 The Board and Audit Committee periodically review the valuation process and provide oversight in accordance with the requirements of Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. 
 As part of the valuation process, the Company will take into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments for which reliable market quotations are not readily available, many of which are loans, including and in combination, as relevant, of: (i) the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company, generally based on an analysis of discounted cash flows, publicly traded comparable companies and comparable transactions, (ii) the nature and realizable value of any collateral, (iii) the portfolio company s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, (iv) the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and (v) overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity or debt sale occurs, the Adviser will consider whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. 
 The Company has and will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of the Company s portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter, and the Company and the Adviser may reasonably rely on that assistance. However, the Adviser is responsible for the ultimate valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Company s valuation policy, the Board s oversight and a consistently applied valuation process. 
 The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. 
 The fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820 prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodology used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The levels used for classifying investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
 Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology that reflect unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 
 Level 2: Inputs to the valuation methodology other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. 
 Level 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Adviser s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 The Company s accounting policy on the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to the Company s financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations, on the financial statements. The SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act which establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. We are in compliance with the requirements of Rule 2a-5. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and interest rate risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and therefore, we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser as the Company s valuation designee under Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, based on, among other things, the input of independent third-party valuation firm(s) retained by the Company, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We may fund portions of our investments with borrowings on a short term basis, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure investors that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 99.8 of our debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio were at floating rates. Based on our Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering base rate floors and ceilings for floating rate instruments assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure) (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 Change in Interest Rates Interest Income Interest Expense Net Income Up 300 basis points 13,531 13,531 Up 200 basis points 9,020 9,020 Up 100 basis points 4,510 4,510 Down 100 basis points (4,510) (4,510) Down 200 basis points (9,020) (9,020) 
 We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments.
