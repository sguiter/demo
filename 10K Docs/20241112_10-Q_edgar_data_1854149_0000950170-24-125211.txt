 units (the Units ), including Units sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional Units to cover over-allotments (the Over-Allotment Units ). The Units were sold at a price of per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of , which is described in Note 3. Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, the Company completed the private sale of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of per Private Placement Warrant (the Private Placement ), to Agriculture Natural Solutions Acquisition Warrant Holdings LLC (the Warrant Holdings Sponsor and the Company s independent directors, generating gross proceeds to the Company of , which is described in Note 4. Transaction costs amounted to , including in deferred underwriting fees, in upfront underwriting fees, and in other offering costs related to the Public Offering. In addition, cash of was held outside of the Trust Account (as defined below) and is available for the payment of offering costs and for working capital purposes. Following the closing of the Public Offering on November 13, 2023, an amount of per Unit) of the proceeds from the Public Offering and Private Placement was deposited into a U.S. based trust account, with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee (the Trust Account ). Except with respect to interest earned on the funds in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, the proceeds from the Public Offering held in the Trust Account will not be released until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Initial Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account proceeds as described below. The remaining proceeds outside the Trust Account may be used to pay for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. The Trust Account The proceeds held in the Trust Account are in demand deposit with a maturity of one hundred eighty-five (185) days or less or in money market funds that meet certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest only in direct U.S. government obligations or in an interest bearing demand deposit account. Funds will remain in the Trust Account until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Initial Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account proceeds as described below. The remaining proceeds outside the Trust Account may be used to pay for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses.

par value, of the Company (the Public Shares ), that have been properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) in a manner that would affect the substance or timing of its obligation to redeem of the Public Shares if it does not complete an Initial Business Combination within months from the closing of the Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of the Public Shares or pre-Initial Business Combination activity; and (iii) the redemption of of the Public Shares if the Company is unable to complete an Initial Business Combination within months from the closing of the Public Offering (subject to the requirements of law). The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company s public shareholders. Initial Business Combination The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Public Offering, although substantially all of the net proceeds of the Public Offering are intended to be generally applied toward consummating an Initial Business Combination. The Initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the Initial Business Combination. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect an Initial Business Combination. The Company, after signing a definitive agreement for an Initial Business Combination, will either (i) seek shareholder approval of the Initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose in connection with which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the Initial Business Combination, for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest but less taxes payable, or (ii) provide shareholders with the opportunity to sell their Public Shares to the Company by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount in cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest but less taxes payable. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of the Initial Business Combination or will allow shareholders to sell their Public Shares in a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require the Company to seek shareholder approval, unless a vote is required by law or under NASDAQ Global Market NASDAQ rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval, it will complete its Initial Business Combination only if it obtains the approval of an ordinary resolution for such Initial Business Combination under Cayman Islands law, or such higher approval threshold as may be required by law. However, in no event will the Company redeem the Public Shares if such redemption would cause the Public Shares to become a penny stock as such term is defined in Rule 3a51-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). In such case, the Company would not proceed with the redemption of its Public Shares and the related Initial Business Combination, and instead may search for an alternate Initial Business Combination. If the Company holds a shareholder vote or there is a tender offer for Public Shares in connection with an Initial Business Combination, a holder of Public Shares will have the right to redeem its shares for an amount in cash equal to its pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest but less taxes payable. As a result, such Public Shares will be recorded at redemption amount and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Public Offering, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Pursuant to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, if the Company is unable to complete the Initial Business Combination within months from the closing of the Public Offering, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned and not previously released to pay the Company s taxes (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the holders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. The Sponsor and the Company s independent directors will not be entitled to rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares (as defined below) held by them if the Company fails to complete the Initial Business Combination within months of the closing of the Public Offering. However, if the Sponsor or any of the Company s directors, officers or affiliates acquires Public Shares in or after the Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete the Initial Business Combination within the prescribed time period.

acres, and a water portfolio of approximately acre-feet. AFA s portfolio includes some of Australia s most iconic properties, including Boonoke , Burrabogie , Wanganella and Wingadee . AFA has total livestock carrying capacity of approximately dry sheep equivalent across its sheep and cattle operations (excluding the Conargo Feedlot). AFA also operates the historic Wanganella and Poll Boonoke merino sheep studs, amongst the most highly regarded studs in Australia. AFA s cropping operations are characterized by flexibility amongst crop types, geographies and seasons. Key crops include irrigated cotton, irrigated rice, wheat, barley, canola, corn, chickpeas and faba beans. More recently, AFA has expanded the capacity of its Conargo Feedlot to a licensed capacity of standard cattle units. Refer to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on September 28, 2022 for additional information regarding the Business Combination. Risks and Uncertainties The United States and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the geopolitical instability resulting from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the recent escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict. In response to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO deployed additional military forces to eastern Europe, and the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have announced various sanctions and restrictive actions against Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities, including the removal of certain financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system. Certain countries, including the United States, have also provided and may continue to provide military aid or other assistance to Ukraine and to Israel, increasing geopolitical tensions among a number of nations. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict and the resulting measures that have been taken, and could be taken in the future, by NATO, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Israel and its neighboring

. Following the closing of the Public Offering, the Company s liquidity needs were satisfied through an amount from net proceeds from the Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants held outside of the Trust Account for existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing business due diligence on prospective target businesses, traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses, reviewing corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, selecting the target business to acquire and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Initial Business Combination. If the Company s estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an Initial Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate its business prior to an Initial Business Combination. Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete an Initial Business Combination or because it becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of its Public Shares upon completion of an Initial Business Combination, in which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Initial Business Combination. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an Initial Business Combination, the Company s officers, directors and initial shareholders may, but are not obligated to, provide it with loans up to as the Company may require Working Capital Loans ). As of September 30, 2024, there were outstanding Working Capital Loans. See Note 4. The Company has incurred and expects to incur additional significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans, including the proposed business combination. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, management has determined that the Company has access to funds from the Sponsor, and the Sponsor has the financial ability to provide such funds, that are sufficient to fund the working capital needs of the Company until the earlier of the consummation of the business combination and one year from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed financial statements. The Company intends to complete a business combination before the mandatory liquidation date.

 As such, the initial carrying value of Public Shares classified as temporary equity was the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20. The Public Shares are subject to ASC 480-10-S99 and are currently not redeemable as the redemption is contingent upon the occurrence of events mentioned above. According to ASC 480-10-S99-15, no subsequent adjustment is needed if it is not probable that the instrument will become redeemable.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not consider the effect of the warrants sold in the Public Offering and Private Placement to purchase Public Shares in the calculation of diluted income (loss) per ordinary share, since their inclusion is contingent on a future event. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did t have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company.

The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company has been subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. There is currently no taxation imposed on income by the government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company s financial statement. The Company s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.

The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to additional Units to cover any over-allotments at the Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The Units that were issued in connection with the over-allotment option were identical to the Units issued in the Public Offering. On November 13, 2023, simultaneously in connection with the Public Offering, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full. 

 Class B ordinary shares, par value, of the Company (the Founder Shares in exchange for a payment (approximately per share) from the Sponsor to cover certain expenses on behalf of the Company.

In November 2022, the Company effected a share dividend with respect to Founder Shares of shares. In September 2023, the Sponsor surrendered to the Company for consideration an aggregate of Founder Shares, which the Company accepted and cancelled. In October 2023, the Company effected a share dividend with respect to the Company s Founder Shares of shares.

Founder Shares were retroactively restated to the net amount issued and outstanding resulting in Founder Shares, acquired for approximately per share and outstanding as of the periods presented. As used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, Founder Shares shall be deemed to include the Public Shares issuable upon conversion thereof. The Founder Shares are identical to the Public Shares included in the Units being sold in the Public Offering except that the Founder Shares automatically convert into Public Shares at the time of the Initial Business Combination (with such conversion taking place immediately prior to, simultaneously with, or immediately following the time of the Initial Business Combination, as may be determined by the directors of the Company) or earlier at the option of the holders thereof and are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below. The Sponsor agreed to forfeit up to an aggregate of Founder Shares to the extent that the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters so that the Founder Shares would represent of the Company s issued and outstanding shares after the Public Offering. As a result of the underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option in full, Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.

 Overview 
 We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Initial Business Combination ). Our Sponsor is Agriculture Natural Solutions Acquisition Sponsor LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company. Our Sponsor is an affiliate of Riverstone Investment Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and its affiliates Riverstone and Impact Ag Partners LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company, and its affiliates Impact Ag ). Although we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business or industry, we intend to capitalize on Riverstone s and Impact Ag s platforms to identify, acquire and build a company whose principal effort is developing and advancing a platform that decarbonizes the traditional agriculture sector and enhances natural capital at scale. We believe these areas of focus represent a favorable and highly fragmented market opportunity to consummate a business combination. 
 The Registration Statement for our initial public offering Public Offering was declared effective on November 8, 2023. On November 13, 2023, we consummated the Public Offering of 34,500,000 units (the Units ), including 4,500,000 Units that were issued pursuant to the underwriters full exercise of their overallotment option, at 10.00 per Unit (the Over-Allotment Units ), generating gross proceeds of 345.0 million, and incurring transaction costs of approximately 20.4 million, consisting of approximately 6.9 million of underwriting fees, approximately 12.1 million of deferred underwriting fees and approximately 1.4 million of other offering costs. The underwriters were granted a 45-day over-allotment option to up to 4,500,000 Over-Allotment Units at the Public Offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full and purchased an additional 4,500,000 Over-Allotment Units at the closing of the Public Offering. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share Public Share and one-half of one warrant Public Warrant ). 
 Simultaneously with the consummation of the Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 9,400,000 private placement warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement (the Private Placement to our Warrant Holdings Sponsor and our independent directors, generating gross proceeds of 9,400,000.

 Results of Operations 
 We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from March 22, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Public Offering, described below, and subsequent to the Public Offering, the Company s search for a target business with which to complete an initial business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination, at the earliest. Following the Public Offering, we generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities. We are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with completing an initial business combination. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported net income of 490,583 which consisted of general and administrative expenses of 4,339,078, offset by 4,829,661 of interest on Trust Account. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had no expense. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported net income of 6,869,813 which consisted of general and administrative expenses of 7,403,914, offset by 14,273,727 of interest on Trust Account. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 698, which consisted of formation costs. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of 1 and a working capital deficit of 2,139,023. Following the closing of the Public Offering, the Company s liquidity needs were satisfied through using an amount from net proceeds from the Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants held outside of the Trust Account for existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing business due diligence on prospective target businesses, traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses, reviewing corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, selecting the target business to acquire and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Initial Business Combination. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 1, which is made up of a net income of 6,869,813, changes in operating assets and liabilities of 5,749,722, and formation and operating costs funded by note payable through Sponsor of 1,654,193. These amounts were offset by an interest on Trust Account of 14,273,727. 
 If the Company s estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate its business prior to an initial business combination. Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete an initial business combination or because it becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of its Public Shares upon completion of an initial business combination, in which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such initial business combination. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an initial business combination, our officers, directors and initial shareholders may, but are not obligated to, provide us with loans up to 1,500,000 as the Company may require Working Capital Loans ). As of September 30, 2024, there were no Working Capital Loans outstanding. On October 30, 2024, the Company borrowed 393,701.70 under the Working Capital Note (as defined below). See Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contractual Obligations - Promissory Note to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The Company has incurred and expects to incur additional significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans, including the proposed business combination. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 205-40,

Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, our management has determined that the Company has access to funds from the Sponsor, and the Sponsor has the financial ability to provide such funds, that are sufficient to fund the working capital needs of the Company until the earlier of the consummation of the business combination and one year from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed financial statements. However, management has determined that if the Company is unable to complete a business combination by November 13, 2025, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after this date. The Company intends to complete a business combination before the mandatory liquidation date.

These holders will be entitled to certain demand and piggyback registration rights. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

 In addition, 0.35 per Unit, or approximately 12,075,000 in the aggregate, will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 
 Administrative Services Agreement 
 Commencing on the date that our securities were first listed on NASDAQ Global Market NASDAQ and continuing until the earlier of our consummation of an initial business combination or our liquidation, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of our Sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative support made available to the Company. Upon completion of an initial business combination or the Company s liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred 90,000 and 0, respectively, in administrative fees. 
 Promissory Note 
 On August 28, 2024, in connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the Working Capital Note in the principal amount of 1,500,000 to Warrant Holdings Sponsor. The Working Capital Note does not bear interest and is repayable in full upon consummation of an Initial Business Combination. If the Company does not complete an Initial Business Combination, the Working Capital Note will not be repaid and all amounts owed under the Working Capital Note will be forgiven except to the extent that the Company has funds available to it outside of its Trust Account. Immediately prior to the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, Warrant Holdings Sponsor may elect to convert all or any portion of the unpaid principal balance of the Working Capital Note into that number of warrants, each entitling the holder to purchase one Public Share (the Working Capital Warrants equal to the principal amount of the Working Capital Note so converted divided by 1.00. The Working Capital Warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The Working Capital Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of which automatically trigger the unpaid principal balance of the Working Capital Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Working Capital Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of September 30, 2024, this Working Capital Note had not been drawn upon. On October 30, 2024, the Company borrowed 393,701.70 under the Working Capital Note. 
 The foregoing description of the Working Capital Note is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Working Capital Note, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.7 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and incorporated herein by reference. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements, and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting estimates: 
 21 

Offering Costs 
 The Company complies with the requirements of the ASC 340-10-S99 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A Expenses of Offering. Deferred offering costs consist principally of professional and registration fees that are related to the Public Offering. FASB ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, addresses the allocation of proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt into its equity and debt components. The Company applied this guidance to allocate Public Offering proceeds from the Units between Public Shares and warrants, using the residual method by allocating Public Offering proceeds first to assigned value of the warrants and then to the Public Shares. Offering costs allocated to the Public Shares were charged to temporary equity and offering costs allocated to the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants were charged to shareholders equity as Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants after management s evaluation were accounted for under equity treatment. The significant judgement involved in valuation of warrant values and the allocation of proceeds led to the assessment of offering costs as a critical accounting estimate. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 We do not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material impact on our unaudited condensed financial statements. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 
 JOBS Act 
 On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our unaudited condensed financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 As an emerging growth company, we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the unaudited condensed financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five (5) years following the completion of our Public Offering or until we otherwise no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. As a result, pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 Item 4. Contro ls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principle executive officer and principle financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our principle executive officer and principle financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our principle executive officer and principle financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective during the period covered by this report. 
 22 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
