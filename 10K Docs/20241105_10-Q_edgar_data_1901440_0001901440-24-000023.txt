Components of the Company s Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 The Company conducts its operations across four major service categories: (1) Certification Testing of products, components and systems according to standards and regulatory requirements and other design and performance specifications; (2) Ongoing Certification Services to validate the continued compliance of previously certified products, components and systems; (3) Non-certification Testing and Other Services, which includes performance testing for customer or other requirements that may not be required by any regulation and may not result in a certification, as well as other services, including advisory and technical services; and (4) Software, comprising software as a service and license-based software solutions, including implementation and training services related to software. 
 Components of Revenue Change 
 The Company uses Organic, Acquisition / Divestiture and FX to explain the change in revenue from period to period. Revenue change is calculated as the percentage change in revenue in one period relative to the prior period s revenue and is a key financial measure that the Company uses to manage its business. The Company defines these components of revenue as follows: 
 Organic reflects revenue change in a given period excluding Acquisition / Divestiture and FX in that same year, expressed in dollars or as a percentage of revenue in the prior period. 
 Acquisition / Divestiture is calculated as revenue change in a given period related to acquisitions or disposals of businesses using prior period exchange rates, expressed in dollars or as a percentage of revenue in the prior period. Revenues from an acquisition or disposal are measured as Acquisition / Divestiture for the initial twelve-month period following the acquisition or disposal date. Subsequently, the revenue impact from the acquired or disposed business is measured as Organic. 
 FX reflects the impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on revenue in a given period, expressed in dollars or as a percentage of revenue in the prior period. The Company uses constant currency to calculate the FX impact on revenue in a given period by translating current period revenues at prior period exchange rates, expressed as a percentage of revenue in the prior period. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue includes personnel related expenses consisting of salaries, incentives, stock-based compensation and other benefits for employees directly attributable to revenue generation across each of the Company s four major service categories. In addition, cost of revenue includes facility related costs for laboratories and other buildings where testing and inspection services are performed, depreciation on equipment used in testing, amortization of capitalized software, customer-related travel costs, expenses related to third-party contractors or third-party facilities and consumable materials and supplies used in testing and inspection and other costs associated with generating revenue. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses include personnel related expenses consisting of salaries, incentives, stock-based compensation and other benefits for indirect administrative functions such as executive, finance, legal, human resources and information technology, not included within cost of revenue. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses include third-party consultancy costs, facility costs, depreciation and amortization, internal research and development costs as well as legal and accounting fees, travel, marketing, bad debt and non-chargeable materials and supplies. The Company expects selling, general and administrative expenses will be impacted by costs associated with being a publicly traded company. 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 During the third quarter of 2023, the Company identified a triggering event and performed a quantitative impairment assessment for a reporting unit in the Consumer segment, which resulted in a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of 37 million. 
 22 

Operating Income 
 Operating income is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and goodwill impairment. Operating income margin is calculated as operating income as a percentage of revenue. 
 Components of Operating Income Change 
 The Company uses Organic, Acquisition / Divestiture and FX to explain the change in operating income from period to period. Operating income change is calculated as the percentage change in operating income in one period relative to the prior period s operating income and is a key financial measure that the Company uses to manage its business. The Company defines these components of operating income as follows: 
 Organic reflects total operating income change in a given period excluding Acquisition / Divestiture and FX in that same period, expressed in dollars or as a percentage of operating income in the prior period. 
 Acquisition / Divestiture is calculated as operating income change in a given period related to acquisitions or disposals of businesses using prior period exchange rates, expressed in dollars or as a percentage of operating income in the prior period. Operating income change from an acquisition or disposal is measured as Acquisition / Divestiture for the initial twelve-month period following the acquisition or disposal date. Subsequently, operating income impact from the acquired or disposed business is measured as Organic. Acquisition / Divestiture also includes the change in due diligence related costs for merger and acquisition and disposal activities. 
 FX reflects the impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on operating income in a given period expressed in dollars or as a percentage of operating income in the prior period. The Company uses constant currency to calculate the FX impact on operating income in a given period by translating current period operating income at prior period exchange rates, expressed as a percentage of operating income in the prior period. 
 Goodwill Impairment reflects goodwill impairment charges recorded when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense on the Company s debt obligations. 
 Other Income (Expense), net 
 Other income (expense), net consists primarily of non-operating gains and losses, income and expenses related to the revaluation performed on designated balance sheet accounts, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, investment income, equity in earnings of non-consolidated affiliates, non-operating pension and postretirement benefit expenses and gains on divestitures. 
 Income Before Income Taxes 
 Income before income taxes is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses, goodwill impairment, interest expense and other income (expense), net. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense consists of current and deferred federal and state taxes for the Company s U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. 
 Net Income 
 Net income is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses, goodwill impairment, interest expense, other income (expense), net and income tax expense. Net income margin is calculated as net income as a percentage of revenue.

 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue increased by 29 million, or 8.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, due to increased compensation expenses of 20 million, primarily due to higher costs associated with performance-based incentives, including the Company s annual cash bonus plan, as well as base salary increases.

 Goodwill Impairment 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company identified a triggering event requiring a quantitative impairment assessment for a reporting unit in the Consumer segment, which resulted in a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of 37 million which did not reoccur in 2024. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased by 7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to interest on the Company s outstanding 6.500 senior notes due 2028 (the notes which were not outstanding in the same period in 2023.

 Income Tax Expense 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 19.0 , which differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to earnings subject to lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and a discrete tax benefit for the release of valuation allowances. This was partially offset by Section 162(m) limitations on current year compensation deductions of certain executive officers and U.S. tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income GILTI net of related foreign tax credits. 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 24.0 , which differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to the impact of non-deductible goodwill impairment and U.S. tax on GILTI net of related foreign tax credits, partially offset by earnings subject to lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and research and development tax credits.

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance which states that the Pillar Two minimum tax should be reflected as a period cost in the period the law is effective rather than enacted, the Company has reflected the impact of the Pillar Two rules that are effective as of September 30, 2024 in its financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the impact is immaterial. The Company is continuing to evaluate aspects of the legislation that will be effective January 1, 2025 and the potential impact on future periods as such changes could result in an increase in its effective tax rate in 2025 and/or other future periods.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue increased by 26 million, or 8.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. On an organic basis, revenue increased 27 million, or 9.2 , primarily due to Non-certification Testing and Other Services revenue growth of 13 million in retail due to increased capacity and demand and in consumer technology driven by higher electromagnetic compatibility testing for automotive and consumer electronics. Certification Testing revenue increased 9 million due to new customer opportunities in consumer technology as well as strength in HVAC as a result of low global warming potential refrigerant regulations. 
 29 

Segment Operating Income 
 Segment operating income increased by 42 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared an operating loss of 5 million in 2023 primarily due to the 27 million increase in organic revenue noted above and a goodwill impairment charge of 37 million in the mobility industry in the three months ended September 30, 2023 which did not reoccur in 2024. This was partially offset by a 23 million increase in organic expenses primarily due to higher compensation expenses of 19 million, related to higher costs associated with performance-based incentives and a prior year CSAR benefit under the Company s pre-IPO LTIP which did not reoccur in 2024. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue increased by 50 million, or 5.7 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.

 Segment Operating Income 
 Segment operating income increased by 61 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to the 62 million increase in organic revenue noted above and a goodwill impairment charge of 37 million in the mobility industry in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which did not reoccur in 2024. This was partially offset by a 38 million increase in organic expenses primarily due to higher compensation expenses of 22 million, related to higher costs associated with performance-based incentives and higher healthcare costs. Additionally, professional fees increased 5 million primarily related to ongoing software projects and higher costs related to the Company s public offerings and depreciation and amortization increased 5 million related to the completion of additional laboratory capacity and software placed in service. 
 
 Software and Advisory 
 The Software and Advisory segment provides complementary software and advisory solutions that extend the value proposition of TIC services the Company offers. The software and technical advisory offerings enable the Company s customers to manage complex regulatory requirements, deliver supply chain transparency and operationalize sustainability.

 Segment Operating Income 
 Segment operating income decreased by 4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to a 6 million increase in expenses, partially offset by the 2 million increase in organic revenue noted above. Expenses increased due to higher compensation expenses of 5 million primarily due to higher costs associated with company-wide performance-based incentives. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to financial measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), the Company considers a variety of financial and operating measures in assessing the performance of the Company s business. The key non-GAAP measures the Company uses are Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income margin, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share and Free Cash Flow, which management believes provide useful information to investors. These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income margin and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to measure the operational strength and performance of its business and the Company believes these measures provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and unusual items that are not expected to continue at the same level in the future. Further, the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide a meaningful measure of business performance and provide a basis for comparing its performance to that of other peer companies using similar measures. The Company uses Free Cash Flow as an additional liquidity measure and believes it provides useful information to investors about the cash generated from its core operations that may be available to repay debt, make other investments and return cash to stockholders. 
 There are material limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other expense (income), net, income tax expense, stock-based compensation expense for equity-settled awards, material asset impairment charges and restructuring expenses which directly affect the Company s net income, as applicable. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share do not take into account certain significant items, including other expense (income), net, stock-based compensation expense for equity-settled awards, material asset impairment charges and restructuring expenses which directly affect the Company s net income and diluted earnings per share, as applicable. Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure. Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 The table below presents these non-GAAP measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

 Adjusted Net Income 
 The Company defines Adjusted Net Income as net income adjusted for other expense (income), net, stock-based compensation expense for equity-settled awards, material asset impairment charges and restructuring expenses, as applicable, each net of tax. Adjusted Net Income margin is calculated as Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of revenue.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 The Company s primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operating activities and cash borrowed under a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders, which provides for senior unsecured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of 1,250 million (collectively, the Credit Facility ). The Company believes the combination of cash and cash equivalents on hand, the generation of cash from operating activities, funds available under the Credit Facility and the Company s ability to access the capital markets provide sufficient liquidity to meet the Company s cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, service of indebtedness and to address other needs for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter, as well as to finance acquisitions, make contributions to the Company s pension and postretirement plans and pay dividends to stockholders, as the Company s board of directors deems appropriate. 
 The Company s cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those referenced in the section titled Risk Factors in Part II Item 1A of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. In addition, the Company cannot predict whether or when it may enter into acquisitions, joint ventures or dispositions, make contributions to the Company s pension and postretirement plans, pay dividends, or what impact any such transactions could have on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 327 million in cash and cash equivalents and 744 million of unused availability under the Credit Facility and access to an accordion feature permitting an increase in the Credit Facility by an aggregate amount of up to 625 million (of which up to 400 million may consist of term loans), subject to the consent of any lenders providing such increase, the absence of any default or event of default and entry into customary documentation with respect to such increase. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table is a summary of the Company s cash flow activity: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 394 341 Net cash used in investing activities (175) (118) Net cash used in financing activities (202) (75) 
 Cash flows from operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 394 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 53 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 341 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by lower payments on the Company s CSARs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 36 

Cash flows from investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 175 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 57 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 118 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a 49 million net decrease in sales of short-term investments, a 23 million increase in capital expenditures and an 8 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions during the current period, partially offset by a 26 million increase in proceeds from divestitures during the current period. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 202 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 127 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 75 million for the same period in 2023. The change was primarily driven by a 110 million net increase in repayments of long-term debt during the current period and a 15 million increase in dividends to stockholders of UL Solutions during the current period. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 The Company makes strategic investments in capital expenditures to enable growth by expanding testing capacity to meet increased demand, to enable new capabilities and product offerings and to increase the efficiency of the Company s processes. Capital expenditures include the building and refurbishment of laboratories and office space, the replacement and upgrade of existing laboratory equipment at the end of its useful life, and investments in technology for internal-use and sale to customers through product development of new software and enhancements of existing software. Cash paid for capital expenditures increased 23 million, to 179 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 156 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Long-Term Debt 
 Credit Facility 
 In January 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders, which provides for senior unsecured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of 1,250 million (collectively, the Credit Facility ), consisting of term loans and revolving loan commitments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility. 
 Since entering the agreement in January 2022, borrowings under the Credit Facility bore interest at a rate per annum equal to, at Company s option, (a) in the case of U.S. dollar loans, the Bloomberg Short-term Bank Yield BSBY rate plus a margin, and for all other currencies, a specified benchmark rate for the applicable currency plus, in certain instances, a specified spread adjustment plus a margin (loans with a rate based on this clause (a), benchmark rate loans or (b) for U.S. dollar loans only, the base rate plus a margin (loans with a rate based on this clause (b), base rate loans ). In addition, the Credit Facility included a provision that replaces BSBY with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus certain specified credit spread adjustments in the event that BSBY ceases to be available as a reference rate. In November 2023, the Bloomberg Index Services Limited announced that the permanent cessation of BSBY and all of its tenors will be effective on November 15, 2024. Accordingly, on June 28, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment (the First Credit Facility Amendment to the Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders. The First Credit Facility Amendment provided, among other things, for (i) the replacement of BSBY with Term SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10 as a benchmark rate for interest periods commencing subsequent to June 28, 2024; (ii) UL Solutions Inc., which was previously the guarantor of the facility, became the named borrower, and UL LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company UL LLC ), which was previously the named borrower, became the guarantor. The foregoing summary of certain provisions of the First Credit Facility Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amendment filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 Senior Notes 
 In October 2023, the Company issued 300 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2028. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of UL Solutions Inc. and are unconditionally guaranteed by UL LLC. 
 37 

Dividends 
 In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid dividends to stockholders of 25 million and 75 million, respectively. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company paid a dividend of 20 million and 60 million to its then sole stockholder, UL Standards Engagement, respectively. 
 The Company increased the regular quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents per share beginning in the first quarter of 2024 and will periodically assess the size of the regular quarterly dividend based on the Company s dividend policy and certain factors described in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Dividends in the Prospectus. The Company cannot give any assurance that the Company will continue to declare dividends in any particular amounts, or at all, in the future. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The Company has purchase obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding, and that specify all significant terms, including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered, the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered, and the timing of the transactions. Purchase obligations exclude liabilities that are included on Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and include commitments for outsourced services, facilities, capital expenditures, cloud service arrangements and various other types of noncancelable contracts. 
 Refer to the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Prospectus, for information about the Company s noncancelable purchase obligations. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements recently adopted and not yet adopted, see Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The Company prepares its condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. While the majority of the Company s revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make judgments and estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. The Company s estimates are based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. To the extent that there are differences between estimates and actual results, the Company s future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected. 
 There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates as described in the Prospectus.

All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report may be forward-looking statements. Statements regarding the Company s future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, including, among others, statements regarding the Company s expected growth and future capital expenditures are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, should, would, likely, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, targets, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, continue and variations of these terms and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms or similar expressions (although not all forward-looking statement may contain such words). The Company cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 38 

There are or will be important factors that could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 any failure on the Company s part to protect and maintain its brand and reputation, or the impact on its brand or reputation of third-party events or actions outside of its control; 
 risks associated with the Company s information technology and software, including those relating to any future data breach or other cybersecurity incident;

 the Company s ability to compete in its industries and the effects of increased competition from its competitors; 
 risks associated with conducting business outside the United States, including those relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; enhanced trade, import or export restrictions; and global, regional or political instability; 
 risks associated with the Company s operations in China, which subject the Company and UL-CCIC Company Limited, the Company s joint venture with the China Certification Inspection (Group) Co., Ltd. CCIC ), to China s complex and rapidly evolving laws, which may be interpreted, applied or enforced inconsistently or in ways inconsistent with its current operations, as well as risks associated with the fact that the Chinese government has the power to exercise significant oversight and discretion over, and intervene in and influence, its business operations in China. 
 the relationship between the United States and China and between the Company and CCIC, as well as changes in U.S. and Chinese regulations affecting the Company s business operations in China; 
 any failure on the Company s part to attract, hire or retain its key employees, including its senior leadership and its skilled and trained engineering, technical and professional personnel; 
 the level of the Company s customers satisfaction and any failure on its part to properly and timely perform its services, meet its contractual obligations or fulfil its customers needs; 
 changes to the relevant regulatory frameworks or private sector requirements, including any requirement that the Company accept third-party test results or certifications of components, end products, processes or systems or any changes that result in a reduction in required inspections, tests or certifications or harmonized international or cross-industry benchmarks and standards; 
 the Company s ability to adequately maintain, protect and enhance its intellectual property, including its registered UL-in-a-circle certification mark and other certification marks; 
 the Company s ability to implement its growth strategies and initiatives successfully; 
 the Company s reliance on third parties, including subcontractors and outside laboratories; 
 the Company s ability to obtain and maintain the requisite licenses, approvals, accreditations and delegations of authority necessary to conduct its business; 
 the outcomes of current and future legal proceedings; 
 the Company s level of indebtedness and future cash needs; 
 failure to generate sufficient cash to service the Company s indebtedness; 
 a change in the assumptions the Company uses to value its goodwill or intangible assets, or the impairment of its goodwill or intangible assets; 
 constraints imposed on the Company s ability to operate its business or make necessary capital investments due to the Company s outstanding indebtedness; 
 the increased expenses and responsibilities associated with being a public company; 
 the significant influence that UL Standards Engagement has over the Company, including pursuant to its rights under the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the Stockholder Agreement with UL Standards Engagement; 
 natural disasters and other catastrophic events, including pandemics and the rapid spread of contagious illnesses, such as new variants of the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 the other factors discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Risk Factors in Part II Item 1A of the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 
 The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in the section titled Risk Factors in Part II Item 1A of the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and the Company s subsequent filings with the SEC. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the Company s underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what the Company anticipates. Many of the important factors that will determine these results are beyond the Company s ability to control or predict. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward- 
 39 

looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and, except as otherwise required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. If the Company updates one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that the Company will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict which will arise. In addition, the Company cannot assess the impact of each factor on the Company s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements attributable to the Company, or others acting on the Company s behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. 
 In addition, statements that the Company believes and similar statements reflect the Company s beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to the Company as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and while the Company believes such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and the Company s statements should not be read to indicate that the Company has conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report and the documents that the Company references in this Quarterly Report with the understanding that the Company s actual future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be materially different from what the Company expects. 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company is exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the Company s financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. The Company s market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure to potential changes in interest rates or inflation and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense. The Company does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company s operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on its Credit Facility, which carries variable interest rates. Because the Company s borrowings bear interest at a variable rate, the Company is exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates. The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk associated with its balances of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company does not currently use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. 
 In November 2023, the Bloomberg Index Services Limited announced that the permanent cessation of BSBY and all of its tenors will be effective on November 15, 2024. Accordingly, on June 28, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment (the First Credit Facility Amendment to the Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders. The First Credit Facility Amendment provided, among other things, for (i) the replacement of BSBY with Term SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10 as a benchmark rate for interest periods commencing subsequent to June 28, 2024; (ii) UL Solutions Inc., which was previously the guarantor of the facility, became the named borrower, and UL LLC, which was previously the named borrower, became the guarantor. The First Credit Facility Amendment had no impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, the variable interest rates applicable to both benchmark rate loans and base rate loans under the Credit Facility generally fluctuated in line with interest rate changes in the marketplace and are expected to continue fluctuating with any future Federal Reserve Board interest rate changes and future changes to the SOFR Index. In addition, increases in interest expense are considered with other expense increases that may be passed, in whole or in part, along to the Company s customers; however, the Company does not expect increases in interest expenses to materially impact pricing strategy in the near term. The increased interest payments on the Company s variable-rate debt are not material to the Company s overall liquidity position and have not impacted, and are not expected to have an impact on, the Company s ability to make timely payments under the Credit Facility or its other obligations. Furthermore, while interest rates impact management s evaluation of capital expenditure projects, the overall cash flows required to support the Company s planned investments have not been materially impacted. Thus, fluctuations in interest rates have not had a material impact on the Company s financial condition. 
 The interest rate for the Company s term loan as of September 30, 2024 was 6.07 , which was a floating rate based on the Term SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10 . A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates affecting the Credit 
 40 

Facility would result in a change to the annual interest expense of approximately 5 million, based on outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024 . A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates affecting the Company s cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments would not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. Notwithstanding the Company s efforts to manage interest rate risk, there can be no assurances that the Company will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 With global operations, the Company has foreign currency risk related to its revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, British pound sterling, Singapore dollar, New Taiwan dollar and the Korean won. Foreign currency gains (losses) are recorded in net income as transactions occur. Changes in exchange rates may substantially affect, either positively or negatively, the revenues and expenses, as expressed in U.S. dollars, of the Company s foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assuming a hypothetical change of 10 in the average foreign currency exchange rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effect on operating income would not be material. The Company is also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of local currencies of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. 
 The Company s results of operations are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to intercompany loan and operating balances between subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Brazilian real, euro, Korean won and the Japanese yen. A transaction made in a currency that differs from the local entity s functional currency is first remeasured at the entity s functional currency. Subsequent foreign currency exchange rate changes result in foreign currency gains (losses) that are recognized in net income. If the transaction is already denominated in the entity s functional currency, only the translation to U.S. dollar reporting is necessary. The remeasurement process required by GAAP for such intercompany loan and operating balances will give rise to foreign exchange gains (losses), which could materially impact the Company s results of operations. 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 The Company has conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information required to be disclosed in the Company s SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 No changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
