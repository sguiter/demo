The foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Report. 
 
 You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations and business strategy. We cannot assure you that the events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. 
 
 These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Report and in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed on March 5, 2024. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the effect of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Report may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. 
 
 The forward-looking statements made in this Report relate only to events as of the date on which the statements were made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Report or to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. You should read this Report and the documents that we reference in this Report and have filed as exhibits to this Report with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 
 
 Investors and others should note that we may announce material business and financial information to our investors using our investor relations website (investors.smartrent.com), SEC filings, webcasts, press releases, and conference calls.

 to and include recurring fixed plan subscription fees. Arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the Company s software at any time. Customers are granted continuous access to the services over the contractual period. Accordingly, fees collected for subscription services are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term beginning on the date the subscription service is made available to the customer.

The revenue is then amortized over its average service life. When a non-distinct Hub Device is included in a contract that does not require a long-term service commitment, the customer obtains a material right to renew the service because purchasing a new device is not required upon renewal. If a contract contains a material right, proceeds are allocated to the material right and recognized over the period of benefit, which is generally .

Despite the Company s requests, the supplier indicated they are not willing to refund the Company for the malfunctioning products previously purchased, and therefore, the Company filed a complaint against the supplier on March 22, 2022 in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Santa Clara (the "Court"). On July 26, 2022, the supplier filed a cross-complaint against the Company for breach of contract and other allegations. In April 2024, the Company made a substantive offer to return the product inventory (valued at to the supplier and pay a portion of the supplier s costs and fees. As of March 31, 2024, the Company recorded a legal accrual of within general and administrative expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss and accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The final settlement agreement was signed in June 2024. As of June 30, 2024, the legal accrual was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the related product inventory was recorded in other current assets. In July 2024, the inventory was returned to the supplier and the Court granted the parties' Request for Dismissal of the action with prejudice. In April 2023, a collective action was filed against the Company in Federal Court in Georgia (the "Federal Court") by two former employees alleging failure to pay overtime wages in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA ). The plaintiffs claim they were improperly classified as exempt employees under the FLSA and thus should have been entitled to overtime pay. Limited discovery was conducted in 2023, and Plaintiffs moved for conditional certification of a collective class in July 2023, which was granted on March 31, 2024. Notice was issued to potential class members, who had until July 15, 2024, to opt into the lawsuit. In October 2024, the parties engaged in a private mediation and agreed to settle the matter for a total amount of , inclusive of all Plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs and related releases, subject to a written agreement and the Federal Court s approval. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a legal accrual of related to this matter within general and administrative expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss and accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company regularly reviews outstanding legal claims, actions and enforcement matters, if any exist, to determine if accruals for expected negative outcomes of such matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates any such outstanding matters based on management s best judgment after consultation with counsel. There is no assurance that the Company's accruals for loss contingencies will not need to be adjusted in the future. The amount of such adjustment could significantly exceed the accruals the Company has recorded. As of September 30, 2024 , an accrual of was included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities related to the legal matters discussed above. The Company had such accruals as of December 31, 2023. 

 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock were issued to certain employees related to vested RSUs and exercised options.

 Overview 
 
 We are an enterprise real estate technology company that provides a comprehensive management platform designed for property owners, managers and residents. Our suite of products and services, which includes both smart building hardware and cloud-based SaaS solutions, provides seamless visibility and control over real estate assets. Our platform can lower operating costs, increase revenues, mitigate operational friction and protect assets for owners and operators, while providing a differentiated, elevated living experience for residents. 
 
 Through a Hub Device, we enable the integration of our platform with third-party smart devices, our own hardware devices and other technology interfaces. We use an open-architecture, brand-agnostic approach that allows owners, operators, and residents to manage their smart home systems through a single connected interface. Our Smart Community solutions include (i) smart apartments and homes, (ii) access control for buildings, common areas, and rental units, (iii) community and resident WiFi, and other solutions such as, asset protection and monitoring, parking management and self-guided tours. Our Smart Operations solutions include work order management, the automation of leasing and resident call handling, audit management, and the automation of the inspection process. We also have a professional services team that provides customers with training, installation, and support services. 
 
 SmartRent is a category leader in the enterprise smart home solutions industry. As of September 30, 2024, we had 787,038 Units Deployed (as defined below) and over 600 customers, including many of the largest multifamily residential owners in the United States. As of that date, we believe our customers owned an aggregate of approximately 7.3 million rental units. This represents approximately 17 of the United States market for institutionally owned multifamily rental units and single-family rental homes. In addition to multifamily residential owners, our customers include some of the leading homebuilders, single-family rental homeowners, and iBuyers in the United States. 
 
 Our Business Model 
 
 We generate revenue primarily from sales of smart home systems which enable property owners and property managers to have visibility and control over assets, while providing all-in-one home control offerings for residents. The majority of our revenue is generated from the direct sale to our customers of hardware smart home devices, which devices generally consist of a Hub Device, door-locks, thermostats, sensors, and light switches. We also generate professional services revenue from installing smart home hardware devices and hosted services revenue from monthly subscription revenue earned from the fees collected from customers to provide access to one or more of our software applications Hosted Services including access controls, asset monitoring, WiFi, and related services. Subscription arrangements have contractual terms ranging from one month to eight years; the majority of our recurring revenue contracts range from one month to one year and our median recurring revenue contract term is one year. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 
 We believe that our success is dependent on many factors, including those further discussed below. Our operating results and cash flows are dependent upon a number of opportunities, challenges and other factors, including our ability to grow our customer base in a cost-effective manner, expand our hardware and hosted service offerings to generate increased revenue per Unit Deployed (as defined below), and provide high quality hardware products and hosted service applications to maximize revenue and improve the leverage of our business model. While these areas represent opportunities for us, they also represent challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to operate our business. 
 
 Active Supply Chain Management 
 
 We continue to experience improvements in the challenges related to the global supply chain. In prior periods, the increased demand for electronics as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. trade relations with China and certain other factors in recent periods led to a global shortage of semiconductors, including Z wave chips, which are a central component of our Hub Devices. Due to this shortage in prior periods, we experienced Hub Device production delays, which affected our ability to meet scheduled installations and facilitate customer upgrades to our higher-margin Hub Devices. We also experienced shortages and shipment delays related to components for Access Control and made-to-order specialty locks. 
 The incremental improvements in the global supply chain are evidenced by our reduction of backlogged Units Deployed for Access Control and made-to-order locks. We believe that this positive trend will continue through the current year.

Investing in Research and Development 
 
 Our performance is significantly dependent on the investments we make in research and development, including our ability to attract and retain highly skilled research and development personnel. We must continually develop and introduce innovative new software services and hardware products, and integrate with third-party products and services, mobile applications and other new offerings. 
 
 New Products, Features and Functionality 
 
 We are evolving our business into a more diverse platform with new products, features and functionality that enhance the value of our smart home operating system. We have introduced a number of SaaS product enhancements and features, including Answer Automation and Work Management solutions, that streamline property management operations. We have also introduced Community WiFi, which provides communities with a private, device-dedicated WiFi network to power Hub Devices and other in-home smart devices, and Smart Package Room, which is a smart package management solution that transforms package visibility, reduces labor demands, optimizes storage space and enhances resident satisfaction. Our Smart Operations Solutions enhance our overall platform offering and customer value proposition by providing a comprehensive one-stop platform that broadens our support of property operations, enhancing the experience for residents, property owners and managers. We offer an open-API architecture that enables a myriad of third-party partner integrations, resulting in a multi-functional platform that enhances property management workflow efficiencies, empowers teams to get more done, elevates resident interactions, and improves resident living experiences. In the future, we intend to continue to release new products and solutions and enhance our existing products and solutions, and we expect that our operating results will be impacted by these releases. 
 
 Category Adoption and Market Growth 
 
 Our future growth depends in part on the continued consumer adoption of hardware and software products which improve the resident experience and the growth of this market. We need to deliver solutions that enhance the resident experience and deliver value to our customers, rental property owners and operators, as well as homebuilders and developers, by providing products and solutions designed to enhance visibility and control over assets while providing additional revenue opportunities. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 On July 30, 2024, the Company announced the departure of Lucas Haldeman, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company s board of directors, effective July 29, 2024. As part of the transition, Mr. Haldeman resigned as a member of the board of directors, effective July 29, 2024. The Company has appointed Daryl Stemm, the Company s Chief Financial Officer, as the Company s Interim Principal Executive Officer, effective as of July 29, 2024. John Dorman, the Board s lead independent director, has been appointed Chairman of the Board, and the Board has formed a Management Committee of current executives to guide the Company through the transition period. The Board has initiated a search to identify the next CEO of SmartRent and is working with a leading executive search firm to assist in the process of identifying and evaluating candidates. 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Key Metrics 
 
 We regularly monitor a number of operating metrics in order to evaluate our operating performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, measure our progress and make strategic decisions. Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate our key metrics are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our SaaS platform. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy. 
 
 Units Deployed and New Units Deployed 
 
 We define Units Deployed as the aggregate number of Hub Devices that have been installed (including customer self-installations) and have an active subscription as of a stated measurement date. We utilize the Units Deployed metric to assess the health of our business and measure the trajectory of our growth. We define New Units Deployed as the aggregate number of Hub Devices that were installed (including customer self-installations) and resulted in a new active subscription during a stated measurement period. Although our revenue is primarily driven by New Units Deployed and the number of Units Deployed, due to the expansion of our products and services that don't require a Hub Device, and Hub Device upgrades that do not result in net new active subscriptions, the correlation between New Units Deployed and revenue is not as strong as it was historically. 
 33 

Although the correlation has decreased, New Units Deployed is still an indicator of our ability to acquire new customers and expand our relationships with our current customers. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had an aggregate of 787,038 and 682,632 Units Deployed, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 15,168 and 32,308 New Units Deployed, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 67,347 and 135,436 New Units Deployed, respectively. 
 
 Units Shipped 
 
 We define Units Shipped as the aggregate number of Hub Devices that have been shipped to customers during a stated measurement period. Units Shipped is used to assess the trajectory of our growth and is an indicator of our ability to acquire new customers and expand our relationships with our current customers. However, we caution that Units Shipped also includes Hub Devices for upgrades and out of warranty replacements and may not be an indicator of New Units Deployed in future periods. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 44,763 and 62,585 Units Shipped, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 145,287 and 176,760 Units Shipped, respectively. 
 Units Booked 
 
 We define Units Booked as the aggregate number of Hub Device units subject to binding orders executed during a stated measurement period that will result in a New Unit Deployed. We utilize the concept of Units Booked to measure estimated near-term resource demand and the resulting approximate range of post-delivery revenue that we will earn and record. Units Booked represent binding orders only. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 there were 17,048 and 46,272 Units Booked, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 there were 101,029 and 131,347 Units Booked, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, ARR (as defined below) related to Units Booked was 1,991 and 7,301, respectively. 
 
 Bookings 
 We define Bookings as the contract value of hardware, professional services, and the first year of ARR for binding orders executed during a stated measurement period. We utilize Bookings to measure revenue expected to be earned in future periods from orders contracted during the current period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Bookings were 19,582 and 49,661, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Bookings were 103,864 and 118,505, respectively. 
 Annual Recurring Revenue 
 
 We define Annual Recurring Revenue ARR as the annualized value of our SaaS revenue earned in the current quarter, which we calculate by taking the total amount of SaaS revenue in the current quarter and multiplying that amount by four. We believe that ARR growth demonstrates our ability to acquire new customers and to maintain and expand our relationships with existing customers. More specifically, we monitor our ARR to assess the general health and trajectory of our Hosted Services business. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, ARR was approximately 53.2 million and 43.3 million, respectively. 
 
 Hardware Average Revenue per Unit ("ARPU"), Professional Services ARPU, SaaS ARPU, and Units Booked SaaS ARPU 
 
 We define Hardware ARPU as total hardware revenue during a given period divided by the total Units Shipped during the same period. Hardware ARPU is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our hardware pricing and assess our ability to market and sell our hardware offerings. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Hardware ARPU was 418 and 569, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Hardware ARPU was 499 and 570, respectively. 
 
 We define Professional Services ARPU as total professional services revenue during a given period divided by the total New Units Deployed, excluding customer self-installations, during the same period. Professional Services ARPU is used to assess our ability to effectively price our installation services. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Professional Services ARPU was 443 and 253, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Professional Services ARPU was 310 and 255, respectively. 
 
 We define SaaS ARPU as total SaaS revenue during a given period divided by the average aggregate Units Deployed in the same period. Average aggregate Units Deployed is calculated as the Units Deployed as of the current period plus the Units Deployed as of the previous period divided by two. SaaS ARPU is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our SaaS pricing and assess our ability to market and sell our various software solutions. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, SaaS ARPU was 5.70 and 5.41, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, SaaS ARPU was 5.61 and 5.33, respectively. 
 
 We define Units Booked SaaS ARPU as the first year ARR for binding orders executed during the stated measurement period divided by the total Units Booked in the same period. Units Booked SaaS ARPU is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our SaaS pricing and assess our ability to market and sell our various software solutions for orders executed during the period. 
 34 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Units Booked SaaS ARPU was 9.73 and 9.04, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Units Booked SaaS ARPU was 9.48 and 7.19, respectively. 
 
 Customer Churn 
 
 We define Customer Churn as cancelled deployed units during the measurement period divided by Units Deployed as of the beginning of the measurement period. Cancelled deployed units are the previously deployed units that have been cancelled during the same measurement period in which a customer cancels all product subscriptions. Our Hosted Services growth is driven by our ability to retain our customers and minimize Customer Churn. Our Customer Churn for our Smart Communities Solutions is 0.01 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our Customer Churn for our Smart Communities Solutions is 0.06 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Revenue Retention 
 We define Net Revenue Retention as SaaS revenue at the end of the current period related to properties which had SaaS revenue at the end of the same period in the prior year, divided by SaaS revenue at the end of the same period in the prior year for those same properties. Net Revenue Retention includes additions to revenue from price increases on existing products, and additions of new products at existing properties, offset by any reductions in revenue caused by cancellations or downgrades. Net Revenue Retention was 101 as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenue 
 
 We generate revenue primarily from sales of systems that consist of hardware devices, professional installation services and Hosted Services enabling property owners and property managers to have visibility and control over assets, while providing all-in-one home control offerings for residents. We record revenue as earned when control of these products and services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to collect for those products and services. The table below summarizes our revenue by solution.

Hardware Revenue 
 
 We generate revenue from the direct sale to our customers of hardware smart home devices, which devices generally consist of a Hub Device, door-locks, thermostats, sensors, and light switches. These hardware devices provide features that function independently without subscription to our software, and the performance obligation for hardware revenue is considered satisfied and revenue is recognized at a point in time when the hardware device is shipped to the customer. Certain Hub Devices do not function independently without the subscription, and therefore, the revenue is recognized in Hosted Services revenue. We generally provide a one-year warranty period on hardware devices that are delivered and installed. We record the cost of the warranty as a component of cost of hardware revenue. 
 
 Professional Services Revenue 
 
 We generate professional services revenue from installing smart home hardware devices, which does not result in significant customization of the installed products and is generally performed over a period ranging from two to four weeks. Installations can be performed by our employees, can be contracted out to a third party with our employees managing the engagement, or can be performed by the customer. Professional services contracts are generally performed on a fixed-price basis and revenue is recognized over the period in which installations are completed. 
 
 Hosted Services Revenue 
 
 Hosted Services primarily consist of monthly subscription revenue earned from the fees collected from customers to provide access to one or more of our software applications including access controls, asset monitoring and related services. These subscription arrangements have contractual terms ranging from one month to eight years and include recurring fixed plan subscription fees. The majority of our recurring revenue contracts range from one month to one year and our median recurring revenue contract term is one year. Our arrangements do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of our software at any time. Customers are granted continuous access to the services over the contractual period. Accordingly, fees collected for subscription services are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term beginning on the date the subscription service is made available to the customer. 
 
 We sell certain Hub Devices, which only function with the subscription to our software applications and related hosting services. We consider those devices and hosting services subscription as a single performance obligation, and therefore we defer the recognition of revenue for those devices that are sold with application subscriptions. The estimated average in-service life of those devices is four years. When a Hub Device without independent functionality is included in a contract that does not require a long-term service commitment, the customer obtains a material right to renew the service because purchasing a new device is not required upon renewal. If a contract contains a material right, proceeds are allocated to the material right and recognized over the period of benefit, which is generally four years. 
 
 Cost of Revenue 
 
 Cost of revenue consists primarily of direct costs of products and services together with the indirect cost of estimated warranty expense and customer care and support over the life of the service arrangement. We expect the cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. We record any change to cost of job performance and job conditions in the period during which the revision is identified. 
 
 Hardware 
 
 Cost of hardware revenue consists primarily of direct costs of products, Hub Devices, hardware devices and supplies purchased from third-party providers, shipping costs, warehouse facility (including depreciation and amortization of capitalized assets and right-of-use assets) and infrastructure costs, personnel-related costs associated with the procurement and distribution of our products and estimated warranty expenses together with the indirect cost of customer care and support. We expect an increase in cost of hardware revenue in absolute dollars in future periods. 
 
 In 2019, the U.S. administration imposed significant changes to U.S. trade policy with respect to China. Tariffs have subjected certain SmartRent products manufactured overseas to additional import duties. The amount of the import tariff has changed numerous times based on action by the U.S. administration. We continue to monitor the change in tariffs. If tariffs are increased, such actions may increase our cost of hardware revenue and reduce our hardware revenue margins in the future. 
 
 Professional Services 
 
 Cost of professional services revenue consists primarily of direct costs related to personnel-related expenses for installation and supervision of installation services, general contractor expenses and travel expenses associated with installation of our products, and indirect costs that are also primarily personnel-related expenses in connection with training of and ongoing support for customers and residents. 
 
 36 

Hosted Services 
 
 Cost of Hosted Services revenue consists primarily of the amortization of the direct costs of certain Hub Devices consistent with the revenue recognition period noted above in Hosted Services Revenue and infrastructure costs associated with providing our software applications together with the indirect cost of customer care and support over the life of the service arrangement. In future periods, we expect the cost of Hosted Services revenue to increase in absolute dollars at a rate that is lower than the corresponding increase in Hosted Services revenue. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs directly associated with our research and development activities. Our research and development efforts are focused on enhancing and developing additional functionality for our existing products and on new product development. We account for the cost of research and development by capitalizing qualifying costs, which are incurred during the product development stage, and amortizing those costs over the product s estimated useful life, which generally ranges from three to five years depending on the type of application. Costs incurred and capitalized during the product development stage generally include the costs of software configuration, coding, and testing. Such costs primarily include payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees directly involved in the product development. We expense preliminary evaluation costs as they are incurred before technological feasibility is achieved, as well as post development implementation and operation costs, such as training, maintenance and minor upgrades. We begin amortizing capitalized costs when a project is ready for its intended use, and we periodically reassess the estimated useful life of a project considering the effects of obsolescence, technology, competition and other economic factors which may result in a shorter remaining life. We believe our research and development costs will increase in absolute dollars as we increase our investment in product development to broaden the capabilities of our solutions and introduce new products and features - in particular as we enhance our WiFi offering. 
 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 
 Our sales and marketing expenses consist of costs directly associated with our sales and marketing activities, which primarily include personnel-related costs, sales commissions, marketing programs, trade shows, and promotional materials. Our sales and marketing expenses may increase over time as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel, increase our marketing activities, grow our operations, and continue to build brand awareness. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs associated with our general and administrative organization, professional fees for legal, accounting and other consulting services, office facility, insurance, information technology costs, and expenses incurred as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and stock exchange listing requirements, additional insurance expense, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. We may also increase the size of our general and administrative staff in order to support the growth of our business but at a rate that is lower than the corresponding increase in total revenue. 
 
 Other Income/Expenses 
 
 Other income/expenses consist primarily of interest income, net of interest expense, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and other income related to the operations of foreign subsidiaries. Interest expense is recorded in connection with our various debt facilities. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses relate to the impact of transactions denominated in a foreign currency other than the U.S. dollar. If we continue to expand our international operations, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies has increased, which we expect to continue. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 The income tax expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss is primarily related to the federal, state, and foreign taxes offset by a change in the valuation allowance. The Company established a full valuation allowance for net deferred U.S. federal and state tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. The Company expects to maintain this valuation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods if it reports taxable income. The Company believes that it has established an adequate allowance for uncertain tax positions, although it can provide no assurance that the final outcome of these matters will not be materially different. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

Total revenue decreased by 17.6 million, or 30 , to 40.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 58.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a 17.4 million decrease in revenue related to our Smart Apartments solution. The decrease in revenue resulted primarily from a 53 decrease in New Units Deployed to 15,168 units for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 32,308 units for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a 28 decrease in Units Shipped to 44,763 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 62,585 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by a 15 increase in the number of cumulative active subscriptions for our Hosted Services during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Overall decreases in New Units Deployed and Units Shipped are primarily attributable to our customers' decisions to defer capital expenditures, driven by broader macroeconomic conditions. In addition, changes in leadership and the structure of our sales organization have impacted sales and overall volumes. 
 Total revenue decreased by 37.1 million, or 21 , to 139.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 176.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a 38.9 million decrease in revenue related to our Smart Apartments solution. The decrease in revenue resulted primarily from a 50 decrease in New Units Deployed to 67,347 units for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 135,436 units for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and a 18 decrease in Units Shipped to 145,287 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 176,760 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by a 15 increase in the number of cumulative active subscriptions for our Hosted Services during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Hardware revenue decreased by 16.9 million, or 47 , to 18.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 35.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in hardware revenue was driven by a decrease in revenue related to our Smart Apartments Solutions and primarily resulted from a 28 decrease in Units Shipped to 44,763 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 62,585 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Hardware revenue decreased by approximately 28.2 million, or 28 , to 72.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 100.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in hardware revenue was driven by a decrease in revenue related to our Smart Apartments Solutions and resulted from a 18 decrease in Units Shipped to 145,287 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 176,760 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and a Hardware ARPU decrease of 12 to 499 for the 2024 period from 570 for the 2023 period. The Hardware ARPU decrease was primarily attributable to a change in product mix which was more heavily weighted to our Alloy SmartHome hardware. The impact of the decrease in hardware revenue was mitigated by an increase in hardware gross margin, primarily driven by the product mix change in the current period. 
 39 

Professional services revenue decreased by 2.7 million, or 45 , to 3.3 million for three months ended September 30, 2024, from 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Of the 2.7 million decrease, 2.6 million was driven by our Smart Apartments Solution. New Units Deployed decreased by 53 to 15,168 units for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 32,308 units for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was partially offset by an increase in Professional services ARPU of 75 to 443 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 253 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in ARPU is primarily attributable to professional services that generate revenue but do not result in a New Unit Deployed such as Access Control and WiFi. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, these services generated 1.5 million of revenue, or 45 of total professional services revenue, compared to 0.9 million of revenue, or 15 of total professional services revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Professional services revenue decreased by 16.2 million, or 56 , to 12.6 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 28.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Of the 16.2 million decrease, 15.2 million was driven by our Smart Apartments solution. New Units Deployed decreased by 50 to 67,347 units for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 135,436 units for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was partially offset by an increase in Professional services ARPU of 22 to 310 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 255 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Hosted Services revenue increased by 2.0 million, or 12 , to 18.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 16.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Of the 18.5 million revenue in 2024, 13.3 million is related to SaaS revenue and 5.2 million is related to hub amortization. Revenue increased from SaaS by 2.5 million and decreased from hub amortization by 0.5 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase of Hosted Services revenue resulted primarily from a 15 increase in the aggregate number of Units Deployed, primarily of our Smart Apartment solution, from 682,632 units at September 30, 2023 to 787,038 units at September 30, 2024 and an increase in SaaS ARPU of 5 to 5.70 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.41 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Hosted Services revenue increased by 7.4 million, or 16 , to 54.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 47.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Of the 54.5 million revenue in 2024, 38.0 million is related to SaaS revenue and 16.5 million is related to hub amortization. Revenue decreased from hub amortization by 1.1 million and increased from SaaS by 8.5 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase of Hosted Services revenue resulted primarily from a 15 increase in the aggregate number of Units Deployed, primarily of our Smart Apartment solution, from 682,632 units at September 30, 2023 to 787,038 units at September 30, 2024 and an increase in SaaS ARPU of 5 to 5.61 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.33 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We don t expect to deploy any more non-distinct Hub Devices, thus, the revenue contribution from hub amortization should continue to decrease in future periods until the non-distinct Hub Devices are fully amortized. The table below shows the expected revenue contribution from hub amortization.

Total cost of revenue decreased by 17.5 million, or 39 , to 27.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 44.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue resulted primarily from a 53 decrease in New Units Deployed and a 28 decrease in Units Shipped of our Smart Apartment solution hardware devices. 
 Total cost of revenue decreased by 54.7 million, or 38 , to 89.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 144.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue resulted primarily from a favorable product mix of our hardware devices (more heavily weighted to Alloy SmartHome hardware), a 50 decrease in New Units Deployed and a 18 decrease in Units Shipped of our Smart Apartment solution hardware devices. 
 Hardware cost of revenue decreased by approximately 13.8 million, or 50 , to 13.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 27.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in hardware cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a favorable product mix, resulting in improved hardware gross margin compared to the prior period, and a 28 decrease in Units Shipped. 
 Hardware cost of revenue decreased by 33.3 million, or 41 , to 48.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 82.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in hardware cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a favorable product mix, resulting in improved hardware gross margin compared to the prior period, and a 18 decrease in Units Shipped. 
 Professional services cost of revenue decreased by 4.3 million, or 39 , to 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 11.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in professional services cost of revenue is primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately 2.6 million in third-party direct labor costs due to a 53 decrease in New Units Deployed, and a decrease of 1.6 million in personnel-related costs, and related travel. Additionally, we have invested in technology initiatives to allow our teams to be more efficient and furthered our collaboration with third-party partners to augment our professional services resulting in improved professional services gross margin compared to the previous period. We believe we will continue to improve efficiency in future periods. 
 Professional services cost of revenue decreased by 22.4 million, or 50 , to 22.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 44.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in professional services cost of revenue is primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately 17.3 million in third-party direct labor costs due to a 50 decrease in New Units Deployed, and a decrease of 4.1 million in personnel-related costs, and related travel. Additionally, we have invested in technology initiatives to allow our teams to be more efficient and furthered our collaboration with third-party partners to augment our professional services resulting in improved professional services gross margin compared to the previous period. We believe we will continue to improve efficiency in future periods. 
 Hosted Services cost of revenue increased by 0.5 million, or 8 , to 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted from a 15 increase in the aggregate number of Units Deployed and the resulting increase in the number of active subscriptions for our software service applications partially offset by a 0.4 million decrease in hub amortization. 
 Hosted Services cost of revenue increased by approximately 0.9 million, or 6 , to 18.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 17.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted from a 15 increase in the aggregate number of Units Deployed and the resulting increase in the number of active subscriptions for our software service applications and an increase in personnel-related costs of 0.6 million, partially offset by a 1.1 million decrease in hub amortization. Our Hosted Services gross margin improved when compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by economies of scale related to our SaaS products. Additionally, Hosted Services attributable to hub amortization, which has a lower margin than our SaaS products, continues to represent a smaller portion of our Hosted Services cost of revenue.

Research and development expenses decreased by 1.0 million, or 13 , to approximately 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting primarily from a decrease of approximately 1.1 million in personnel-related expenses. 
 Research and development expenses increased by 1.1 million, or 5 , to approximately 22.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 21.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to an increase of 1.1 million in personnel-related expenses. The increase was primarily related to the employee retention credits recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which were refundable employment tax credits provided by The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. These employment tax credits did not recur during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We believe our research and development costs will increase in absolute dollars as we increase our investment in product development to enhance the capabilities of our solutions and introduce new products and features. 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 0.2 million, or 4 , to 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting primarily from a decrease in personnel-related expenses. We believe our sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods as we invest in building a scalable sales team, beginning with our new Chief Revenue Officer ("CRO"), Natalie Cariola. 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 0.9 million, or 6 , to 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting primarily from a decrease of approximately 1.0 million in personnel-related expenses. We believe our sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods as we invest in building a scalable sales team, beginning with our new CRO, Natalie Cariola. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased by 2.9 million, or 26 , to 14.2 million, from 11.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting primarily from 2.8 million of severance and related expenses attributable to the departure of our former CEO. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased by 9.0 million, or 26 , to 42.8 million, from 33.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting primarily from a 9.7 million increase in third-party consultants. This was largely driven by a 5.3 million legal accrual recorded as of June 30, 2024, in which the Company agreed to settle a dispute with a supplier by returning 5.0 million of inventory and paying a portion of the supplier s costs and fees. Additionally, we incurred 2.8 million of severance and related expenses attributable to the departure of our former CEO.

 Interest income, net increased by approximately 0.6 million to 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income for both periods is primarily attributable to interest earned on interest-bearing cash balances.

We provided a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has gross NOLs of 204.6 million and 193.4 million for federal and state income tax return purposes, respectively. Federal NOLs can be carried forward indefinitely, while State NOLs will expire between 2032 and 2043. The Company also has 0.1 million of R D credits available that expire in 2039. 
 The income tax expense is related to the federal, state, and foreign taxes offset by a change in the valuation allowance. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement the condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, described below, as non-GAAP measures. We believe the presentation of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our management team and improves investors understanding of our underlying operating performance and their ability to analyze our ongoing operating trends. 
 All historic non-GAAP financial measures have been reconciled with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures - these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP results. 
 
 We define EBITDA as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP before interest income, net, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before expenses related to non-recurring legal matters, stock-based compensation, impairment of investment in a non-affiliate, non-recurring warranty provisions, compensation expense in connection with acquisitions, other acquisition expenses, and other expenses caused by non-recurring, or unusual, events that are not indicative of our ongoing business. 
 Our management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial and operating performance, and we believe these measures are helpful to management and external users in understanding our performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA help management identify controllable cash expenses and make decisions designed to help us meet our identified financial and operational goals and to optimize our financial performance, while neutralizing the impact of some expenses included in our operating results caused by external influences over which management has little or no control and by non-recurring, or unusual, events that might otherwise mask trends in our performance. Accordingly, we believe these metrics measure our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short-term, namely our cost structure and expenses. 
 We believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors in assessing our results of operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other companies.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 163.4 million, which were held for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our cash equivalents are comprised primarily of money market funds. To date, our principal sources of liquidity have been the net proceeds received as a result of the Business Combination, and payments collected from sales to our customers. 
 Debt Issuances 
 Following the maturity of our Revolving Facility (as defined below) in December 2021, we entered into a 75.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a five-year term (the "Senior Revolving Facility" . Interest rates for draws upon the Senior Revolving Facility are determined by whether the Company elects a secured overnight financing rate loan SOFR Loan or alternate base rate loan ABR Loan ). For SOFR Loans, the interest rate is based upon the forward-looking term rate based on SOFR as published by the CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited (CBA) plus 0.10 , subject to a floor of 0.00 , plus an applicable margin. For ABR Loans, the interest rate is based upon the highest of (i) the Prime Rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50 , or (iii) 3.25 , plus an applicable margin. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable margins for SOFR Loans and ABR Loans under the Senior Revolving Facility were 1.75 and (0.50 ), respectively. The Senior Revolving Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company s assets and guaranteed by each of the Company s material domestic subsidiaries. 
 44 

We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity under the Senior Revolving Facility, and cash raised in the Business Combination will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months beyond the issuance date of this Report. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including our sales volume, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, and market adoption of our new and enhanced products and features. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. From time to time, we may seek to raise additional funds through equity and debt. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and on reasonable terms, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 In March 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 50 million of our Class A common stock. Repurchases under the program may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our Class A common stock and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. The timing and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the stock price, business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities, acquisition opportunities, and other factors. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 9.8 million shares of our Class A common stock under the stock repurchase program at an average price of approximately 1.75 per share for a total of 17.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 12.1 million shares of our Class A common stock under the stock repurchase program at an average price of approximately 1.93 per share for a total of 23.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 26.7 million remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program.

Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating activities used 20.9 million in cash resulting primarily from our net loss of 22.2 million and 26.4 million used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by approximately 27.7 million provided by non-cash expenses. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from a 23.2 million decrease in deferred revenue, a 5.6 million decrease in accounts payable, and a 5.3 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by a 8.2 million decrease in deferred cost of revenue. Non-cash expenses consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of 9.5 million, non-cash legal expenses of 7.3 million, primarily driven by 5.0 million in which the Company agreed to settle a legal dispute with a supplier by returning 5.0 million of inventory, depreciation and amortization of 4.7 million, provision for excess and obsolete inventory of 2.7 million and impairment of investment in non-affiliate of 2.3 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our operating activities used 1.4 million in cash resulting primarily from our net loss of 31.3 million partially offset by 10.9 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities and 19.0 million provided by non-cash expenses. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from a 26.4 million decrease in inventory, a 9.9 million decrease in deferred cost of revenue and a 0.5 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by an 12.3 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities and a 9.3 million decrease in accounts payable. Non-cash expenses consisted primarily of stock-based compensation of 10.2 million, depreciation and amortization of 4.0 million, compensation expense related to acquisitions of 1.9 million, and provision for excess and obsolete inventory of 1.8 million. Of the total cash used for our operating activities, 6.0 million was attributable to payments related to the SightPlan acquisition. While the Agreement with ADI did not have a cash flow impact during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we believe the Agreement will have a positive impact on cash flow in future periods. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 5.0 million of cash from investing activities, resulting primarily from cash paid of 4.5 million for capitalized internal-use software development costs and 0.5 million for the purchase of property and equipment. 
 45 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 3.3 million of cash for investing activities, resulting primarily from cash paid for capitalized internal-use software development costs. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our financing activities used 26.3 million of cash, resulting primarily from 23.5 million used for repurchases of Class A common stock, 1.8 million used for taxes paid related to net share settlements of stock-based compensation awards and 1.5 million used for earnout payments related to the iQuue acquisition. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our financing activities used 1.5 million of cash, resulting primarily from 1.7 million used for earnout payments related to the iQuue acquisition. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can significantly impact the amounts we report as assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and the related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We derive revenue primarily from sales of systems that consist of hardware devices, professional installation services and Hosted Services to assist property owners and property managers with visibility and control over assets, while providing all-in-one home control offerings for residents. Revenue is recognized when control of these products and services are transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products and services. 
 Payments we receive by credit card, check, or automated clearing house payments, and payment terms are determined by individual contracts and range from due upon receipt to net 30 days. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in reported revenue. Payments received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are reported as deferred revenue. 
 We apply the practical expedient that allows for inclusion of the future auto-renewals in the initial measurement of the transaction price. We only apply these steps when it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to a customer. 
 Accounting for contracts recognized over time involves the use of various estimates of total contract revenue and costs. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that estimates of costs to complete a performance obligation may be revised in the future as we observe the economic performance of our contracts. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revision to our estimates of revenue and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revision is identified. 
 We may enter into contracts that contain multiple distinct performance obligations including hardware and Hosted Services. The hardware performance obligation includes the delivery of hardware, and the Hosted Services performance obligation allows the customer use of our software during the contracted-use term. The subscription for the software and certain Hub Devices combine as one performance obligation, and there is no support or ongoing subscription for other device hardware. We partner with several manufacturers to offer a range of compatible hardware options for its customers. We maintain control of the hardware purchased from manufacturers prior to it being transferred to the customer, and accordingly, SmartRent is considered the principal in these arrangements. 
 For each performance obligation identified, we estimate the standalone selling price, which represents the price at which we would sell the good or service separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price, considering available information such as market conditions, historical pricing data, and internal pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations. We then allocate the transaction price among those obligations based on the estimation of the standalone selling price. 
 46 

Inventory Valuation 
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is computed under the first-in, first-out method. We adjust the inventory balance based on anticipated obsolescence, usage, and historical write-offs. Significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures. We consider marketability and product life cycle stage, product development plans, demand forecasts, historical revenue, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions in establishing our estimates. If the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements, we may be required to increase our inventory adjustment. A change in our estimates could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations. 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 Our stock-based compensation relates to stock options and restricted stock units ("RSUs") granted to our employees and directors. Stock-based awards are measured based on the grant date fair value. We estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs is based on the grant date fair value of the stock price. The fair value of these awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period in which the awards are expected to vest. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur by reversing previously recognized compensation expense. 
 The Black-Scholes model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock-based awards. These variables include the per share fair value of the underlying common stock, exercise price, expected term, risk-free interest rate, expected annual dividend yield, the expected stock price volatility over the expected term and forfeitures, which are recognized as they occur. For all stock options granted, we calculated the expected term using the simplified method for plain vanilla stock option awards. 
 The grant date fair value is also utilized with respect to RSUs with performance and service conditions to vest. For RSUs with a performance condition, based on a liquidity event, as well as a service condition to vest, no compensation expense is recognized until the performance condition has been satisfied. Subsequent to the liquidity event, compensation expense is recognized to the extent the requisite service period has been completed and compensation expense thereafter is recognized on an accelerated attribution method. Under the accelerated attribution method, compensation expense is recognized over the remaining requisite service period for each service condition tranche as though each tranche is, in substance, a separate award. In August 2021, the Company completed the merger with FWAA, which met the liquidity event vesting condition and triggered the recognition of compensation expense for RSUs for which the time-based vesting condition had been satisfied or partially satisfied. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act") exempts emerging growth companies as defined in Section 2(A) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can choose not to take advantage of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, and any such election to not take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. We are an emerging growth company and have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public business entities and non-public business entities until the earlier of the date we (a) are no longer an emerging growth company or (b) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. The extended transition period exemptions afforded by our emerging growth company status may make it difficult or impossible to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of this exemption because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act until the earliest of (a) the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the initial public offering by FWAA, which closed on February 9, 2021, (b) the last date of our fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, (c) the last date of our fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC with at least 700.0 million of outstanding securities held by non-affiliates or (d) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non- convertible debt securities during the previous three years.

Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial condition due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect, to date, on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Interest Rate Fluctuation Risk 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of approximately 163.7 million, which consisted primarily of institutional money market funds, which carries a degree of interest rate risk. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would increase our annual interest income by 16.4 million, or decrease our annual interest income by 6.7 million, based on our cash position as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all of our revenue is generated in U.S. dollars. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in the United States and to a lesser extent in Croatia and other international markets. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging strategies. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates. 
 48 

Item 4 - Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Interim Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) at the end of the period covered by this Report and, based on such evaluation, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Report was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Interim Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. Other Information 
 
 Item 1 Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we are subject to various claims, charges and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. We believe these actions are a normal incident of the nature and kind of business in which we are engaged. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with certainty, we do not believe that any asserted or unasserted legal claims or proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 
 Item 1A Risk Factors 
 
 We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties relating to our business, please see the section titled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on 10-K filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024. Other than the risk factor below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed therein. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future SEC filings. 
 
 We may not successfully manage the transition of leadership associated with the departure of our Chief Executive Officer, which could have an adverse impact on us. 
 
 On July 29, 2024, Lucas Haldeman ended his tenure as the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. In connection with Mr. Haldeman s departure, Daryl Stemm, our Chief Financial Officer, was appointed as our Interim Principal Executive Officer, and John Dorman, a current member of our board of directors, was appointed Chairman of the Board. The Company has also formed a Management Committee to guide the Company through the transition period until a new Chief Executive Officer is appointed. Our success will depend, in part, on our management of the transition to our Management Committee and our Interim Principal Executive Officer, the effectiveness of our Management Committee and our Interim Principal Executive Officer, our search for, transition to and integration of a permanent successor Chief Executive Officer, and the effectiveness of the permanent successor, if appointed. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in finding a suitable permanent successor or that we will be able to do so in a timely manner. The Chief Executive Officer position is critical to executing on and achieving our vision, strategic direction, culture, and products. The leadership transition may create uncertainty among employees, suppliers and customers, divert resources and management attention, and impact public or market perception, our stock price or our performance, any of which could negatively impact our ability to operate effectively which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
