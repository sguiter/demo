and negative net working capital
of million. As a result of our losses and our projected cash needs, substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of
management s plan over the next twelve months to improve the Company s liquidity and profitability, which includes, without
limitation: 

Increasing
 revenue by increasing occupancy in the facilities and increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates; 

Controlling
 operating expenses; and 

Seeking
 additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities, or the sale of assets. 

The
focus on opportunities within our current portfolio and future properties to acquire and operate, the settlement, refinance, and continued
service of debt obligations, the potential funds generated from stock sales and other initiatives contributing to additional working
capital should alleviate any substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern as defined by ASU 2014-05.
However, we cannot predict, with certainty, the outcome of our actions to generate liquidity and the failure to do so could negatively
impact our future operations.

Results
of Operations 

The
following discussion of the financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and changes in our financial position should be read
in conjunction with our interim consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q. 

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Rental
revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 totaled 0 and 158,927. This decrease was due to the sale of our Archway Property in June with
which we had monthly rental revenues of approximately 53,000. Since this was the only property that we were leasing to a third party,
rental revenue will continue to be 0 going forward. The Company also had healthcare revenue of
 10,016,416 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8,886,529 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Healthcare
revenues increased due to change in occupancy, patient mix and Medicaid rates. The Company had Healthcare Grant revenue of 0 and 0
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

General
and administrative expenses were 2,395,897 and 3,133,797 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In 2024, the
Company healthcare operations management has hired a contract CFO, Controller, two Corporate Staff Accountants, and administration
assistant to support the corporate team and will continue to aid the facilities in delivering world class care. This addition is offset by a decrease in contract services that were used in 2023 and not in 2024. 

Property
taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses totaled 7,573,735 and 7,698,266 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. This decrease is attributed to a decrease in operational headcount resulting in lower operational wages and decreased spending
on COVID related expenses. 

17 

Depreciation
and amortization expense totaled 374,118 and 357,868 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Provision
for credit losses totaled 844,429 and 269,197 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase is
related to an increase in accounts receivable and the related accounts receivable over 60 days past due. 

The
Company had 471,356 of interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 408,211 interest expense for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. This increase is mainly due to the extension of several fixed rate mortgages. These were partially offset by the repayment of our mortgage for our Archway Property upon the sale of that property
in June 2024. The interest expense associated with that property was approximately 24,000 per month. 

The
Company had income of 0 and 516,226 from employee retention credits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The
Company had 39,771 of other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 43,325 for the three months ended September 30,
2023. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Rental
revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 totaled 321,352 and 475,643. This decrease was due to the sale of our Archway Property in June with
which we had monthly rental revenues of approximately 53,000. Since this was the only property that we were leasing to a third party,
rental revenue will continue to be 0 going forward. The Company also had healthcare revenue
of 28,772,271 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 25,493,545 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Healthcare
revenues increased due to change in occupancy, patient mix and Medicaid rates. The Company had Healthcare Grant revenue of 0 compared
to 1,610,753 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in healthcare grant revenues
is primarily due to the healthcare grant revenues received from the State of Oklahoma ceased in May 2023. Our healthcare revenues will
likely continue to decrease due to a decrease in Medicaid rates. 

General
and administrative expenses were 6,982,262 and 7,510,881, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company healthcare
operations management has hired a contract CFO, Controller, two Corporate Staff Accountants and administrative assistant to support the
corporate team and will continue to aid the facilities in delivering world class care. 

Property
taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses totaled 22,491,386 and 23,633,389 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. This decrease is attributed to a decrease in operational headcount resulting in lower operational wages and decreased spending
on COVID related expenses. 

Depreciation
and amortization expense totaled 1,207,247 and 1,235,446 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This
decrease is mainly due to the sale of the Company s Goodwill Hunting property. 

Provision
for credit losses totaled 1,044,665 and 1,167,332 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease
is related to a decrease in accounts receivable and the related accounts receivable over 60 days past due. 

The
Company had 1,662,037 of interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 1,493,923 interest expense for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is mainly due to the extension of several fixed rate mortgages. These were partially offset
by the repayment of our mortgage for our Archway Property upon the sale of that property in June 2024. The interest expense associated
with that property was approximately 24,000 per month. 

The
Company had income of 0 and 6,866,759 from employee retention credits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

The
Company had 363,466 of other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 256,347 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. As part of other income for both periods presented, the Company recorded the principal reduction payments made by the operator
for the Arkansas facility as other income. We will continue to record this as the operator continues to satisfy the debt. 

The
Company recorded 2,112,143 in a gain on the sale of our Goodwill Hunting property for the nine months ended September 30,2024 and 0
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources and Going Concern 

On
August 27, 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-05, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s ability to Continue as a Going Concern,
which requires management to assess a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from financial statement
issuance and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. In accordance with ASU 2014-05, management s analysis
can only include the potential mitigating impact of management s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the issuance
date if (a) it is probable that management s plans will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, and (b) it is probable that
the plans, when implemented, will alleviate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company had negative operating cash flows of 1,401,076 and negative net working capital of 16.7 million. As a result of our losses and
our projected cash needs, substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern.
This presentation contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business and does
not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described below. 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of 984,373 and restricted cash of 838,223. Our restricted cash is to be spent on insurance,
taxes, repairs, and capital expenditures associated with Providence of Sparta Nursing Home or Warrenton Health and Rehab. Our liquidity
is expected to increase from potential equity and debt offerings and decrease as net offering proceeds are expended in connection with
our various property improvement projects. Our continuing short-term liquidity requirements consisting primarily of operating expenses
and debt service requirements, excluding balloon payments at maturity, are expected to be achieved from healthcare operations, rental
revenues received, and existing cash on hand. 

Cash
used in operating activities was 1,401,076 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by operating activities
of 2,390,891 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cash
provided by investing activities was 2,458,573 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in investing activities
of 27,891 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cash
used in financing activities was 1,539,624 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash used in financing activities
of 1,708,221 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Effective June 18, 2024, Selectis Health, Inc, a Utah corporation (the
 Company ), announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Goodwill Hunting, LLC (the Seller ), has consummated
and closed the sale of property located in Macon, Bibb County, Georgia, including the skilled nursing facility known as Archway Transitional
Care Center 1 (collectively, the Archway Property ). In accordance with the original Purchase and Sale Agreement
(the PSA executed on May 1, 2024, Bibb County Holdings II, LLC (the Purchaser has purchased the Archway
Property for 6.75 million. The sale was completed on June 18, 2024. 

The transaction provided the Company with net cash proceeds of 2,484,800,
of which 833,213 was used to redeem investor notes related to the Archway Property, leaving 1,651,587 for the Company to fund operations
and general and administrative expenses. 

The
focus on opportunities within our current portfolio and future properties to acquire and operate, the settlement, refinance, and continued
service of debt obligations, the potential funds generated from stock sales and other initiatives contributing to additional working
capital should alleviate any substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern as defined by ASU 2014-05.
However, we cannot predict, with certainty, the outcome of our actions to generate liquidity and the failure to do so could negatively
impact our future operations. 

The
CARES Act provides an employee retention credit CARES Employee Retention Credit ), which is a refundable tax credit against
certain employment taxes of up to 5,000 per employee for eligible employers. The tax credit is equal to 50 of qualified wages paid
to employees during a quarter, capped at 10,000 of qualified wages per employee through December 31, 2020. Additional relief provisions
were passed by the United States government, which extend and slightly expand the qualified wage caps on these credits through December
31, 2021. Based on these additional provisions, the tax credit is now equal to 70 of qualified wages paid to employees during a quarter,
and the limit on qualified wages per employee has been increased to 10,000 of qualified wages per quarter. The Company qualified for
the tax credit under the CARES Act for qualified wages for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021. In February 2023, the Company
submitted filings for CARES Employee Retention Credits totaling 6,350,533. As of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an employee
retention credits receivable of 1,257,952. Upon evaluation of the collectability of this receivable, the Company recorded a full allowance
against this receivable. As of September 30, 2024, this net receivable remains at 0.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
we consider material. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Set
forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements. Certain of these accounting policies are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results
of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements set forth elsewhere in this report. These policies require the application
of judgment and assumptions by management and, as a result, are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Actual results could differ as a
result of such judgment and assumptions. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance
with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as revenues and expenses reported for the period
presented. The most critical estimates relate to the useful life and impairment of intangible assets and allowance for doubtful accounts.
The Company regularly will assess these estimates and, while actual results may differ, management believes that the estimates are reasonable. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

When
circumstances indicate the carrying value of property may not be recoverable, the Company reviews the asset for impairment. This review
is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s
use and eventual disposition. This estimate considers factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends
and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists, due to the inability
to recover the carrying amount of the property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated
fair value of the property. Estimated fair value is determined with the assistance from independent valuation specialists using recent
sales of similar assets, market conditions and projected cash flows of properties using standard industry valuation techniques. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill
represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to its net assets. Goodwill is not amortized but
is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or when an event occurs, or circumstances change that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger
interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit,
or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. 

The
Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit
is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely
than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, an impairment test is unnecessary. If an impairment
test is necessary, the Company will estimate the fair value of its related reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is determined to be impaired, and the Company will proceed with recording
an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , including
subsequently issued updates. Under the accounting guidance our revenues are presented net of estimated allowances, and we no longer present
the contractual allowance as a separate line item on our balance sheet. 

The
Company reviews its calculations for the realizability of gross service revenues monthly to make certain that we are properly allowing
for the uncollectible portion of our gross billings and that our estimates remain sensitive to variances and changes within our payer
groups. The contractual allowance calculation is made based on historical allowance rates for the various specific payer groups monthly
with a greater emphasis given to current trends. This calculation is routinely analyzed by the Company based on actual allowances issued
by payers and the actual payments made to determine what adjustments, if any, are needed. 

Our
revenues generally relate to contracts with patients in which our performance obligations are to provide health care services to the
patients. Revenues are recorded during the period our obligations to provide health care services are satisfied. Our performance obligations
for inpatient services are generally satisfied over periods that average approximately five days, and revenues are recognized based on
charges incurred in relation to total expected charges. The contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party
payer (Medicare, and Medicaid) and the transaction prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by (Medicare,
and Medicaid). Medicare generally pays for inpatient and outpatient services at prospectively determined rates based on clinical, diagnostic
and other factors. Services provided to patients having Medicaid coverage are generally paid at prospectively determined rates per discharge,
per identified service or per covered member. 

20 

When
the lessee is the owner of any improvements, any lessee improvement allowance that is funded by the Company is treated as a lease incentive
and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. As of September 30, 2024, and 2023, there were no deferred lease incentives
recorded. 

Our
revenues are based upon the estimated amounts we expect to be entitled to receive from patients and third-party payers. Estimates of
contractual allowances under managed care are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. 

Laws
and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. Estimated reimbursement amounts
are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final settlements are determined (in relation to certain
government programs, primarily Medicare, this is generally referred to as the cost report filing and settlement process). 

Measurement of Credit Losses 

In
September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instrument ASU 2016-13 ).
ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a forward-looking approach based on current expected credit losses CECL to estimate
credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. This may result in the earlier recognition of allowances
for losses. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 January 1, 2023. We identified trade accounts receivable financial instruments that would
be impacted by this adoption. 

The
CARES Act provides an employee retention credit CARES Employee Retention Credit ), which is a refundable tax credit against
certain employment taxes of up to 5,000 per employee for eligible employers. The tax credit is equal to 50 of qualified wages paid
to employees during a quarter, capped at 10,000 of qualified wages per employee through December 31, 2020. Additional relief provisions
were passed by the United States government, which extend and slightly expand the qualified wage caps on these credits through December
31, 2021. Based on these additional provisions, the tax credit is now equal to 70 of qualified wages paid to employees during a quarter,
and the limit on qualified wages per employee has been increased to 10,000 of qualified wages per quarter. The Company qualified for
the tax credit under the CARES Act for qualified wages for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021. In February 2023, the Company
submitted filings for CARES Employee Retention Credits totaling 6,350,533. As of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an employee
retention credits receivable of 1,257,952. Upon evaluation of the collectability of this receivable, the Company recorded a full allowance
against this receivable. As of September 30, 2024, this receivable remains at 0. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

The
FASB and other entities issued new or modifications to, or interpretations of, existing accounting guidance during 2024. Management has
carefully considered the new pronouncements that altered generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any other
new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company s reported financial position or operations in the near term. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not
applicable. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature,
can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. 

Our
management, including our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our
CEO and CFO concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to provide
assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to management as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosures. 

Management
noted the following deficiencies that we believe to be material weaknesses: 

Inadequate
 design of information technology (IT) general and application controls resulting from inappropriate access given to certain individuals
 within finance, including the CFO and Controller; 

Lack
 of segregation of duties in certain accounting and financial reporting processes including the initiation, processing, recording
 and approval of disbursements; and 

Lack
 of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review as well as timely review of accounts and reconciliations leading
 to material post-closing adjustments. 

In
light of the material weaknesses described above, we performed additional analysis deemed necessary to ensure that our unaudited interim
financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes
that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The Company plans to implement multi-level review in 2024, and management
intends to work internally and with various third-parties to ensure we have the proper controls in place going forward. 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
