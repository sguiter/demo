Contract Liabilities Timing may differ between the satisfaction of performance obligations and the invoicing and collections of amounts related to the Company s contracts with customers. Liabilities are recorded for amounts that are collected in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations. Additionally, certain customers may receive credits, which are accounted for as a material right. The Company estimates these amounts based on the expected amount of future services to be provided to the customer and allocates a portion of the transaction price to these material rights. The Company recognizes these material rights as the material rights are exercised. The resulting material rights amounts included in the contract liabilities on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The Notes are unsecured and rank senior in right of payment to the Company s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and equal in right of payment to the Company s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company s election. Terms of the Notes Prior to the close of business on September 15, 2025 and September 14, 2026, the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes, respectively, will be convertible at the option of holders during certain periods, only upon satisfaction of certain conditions set forth below. On or after September 15, 2025 (for the 2025 Notes) and September 14, 2026 (for the 2026 Notes), until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the applicable maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at the applicable conversion price at any time regardless of whether the conditions set forth below have been met. Holders may convert all or a portion of their Notes prior to the close of business on the day immediately preceding their respective free convertibility date described above, in multiples of the principal amount, only under the following circumstances : during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2021 for the 2025 Notes and March 31, 2022 for the 2026 Notes (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sales price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day; 

 during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period, or the Notes measurement period, in which the trading price (as defined in each Indenture) per principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the Notes measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; 

 if the Company calls any or all of the Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on for the 2025 Notes or for the 2026 Notes; or 

 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as set forth in the Indentures.

Whether the 2026 Notes or the 2025 Notes will be convertible in the future prior to the applicable free convertibility date will depend on the satisfaction of the trading price condition or another conversion condition specified in the Indentures. Since the Company may elect to repay the 2026 Notes and the 2025 Notes in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of both, the Company has continued to classify the 2026 and the 2025 Notes as long-term debt on its consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.

Additionally, beginning with awards made in August 2015, the Company had the option to direct a net issuance of shares for satisfaction of tax liability with respect to vesting of awards and delivery of shares. Prior to August 2015, this choice of settlement method was solely at the discretion of the award recipient. The 2007 Plan expired in . new awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan; however, the shares of common stock remaining in the 2007 Plan are available for issuance in connection with previously awarded grants under the 2007 Plan. There are shares of common stock that remain subject to outstanding stock grants under the 2007 Plan as of September 30, 2024.

. The 2017 Plan replaces the Company s 2007 Plan. On June 16, 2017, shares of the Company s common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan and, generally, shares that are forfeited or canceled from awards under the 2017 Plan also will be available for future awards. In April 2021, the stockholders of the Company authorized the issuance of up to an additional shares of the Company s common stock under the 2017 Plan. Under the 2017 Plan, the Company may grant restricted stock and restricted stock units, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, and other stock-based and cash-based awards. Grants generally vest in equal tranches over a period. Stock options granted under the 2017 Plan expire no later than after the grant date. Shares of stock issued pursuant to restricted stock awards are restricted in that they are not transferable until they vest. Shares of stock underlying awards of restricted stock units are not issued until the units vest. Non-qualified stock options cannot be exercised until they vest. Under the 2017 Plan, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must be granted with an exercise price that is at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The 2017 Plan broadly prohibits the repricing of options and stock appreciation rights without stockholder approval and requires that no dividends or dividend equivalents be paid with respect to options or stock appreciation rights. The 2017 Plan further provides that, in the event any dividends or dividend equivalents are declared with respect to restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock-based awards and performance awards (referred to as full-value awards ), such dividends or dividend equivalents would be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as the underlying award.

On June 7, 2022, shares of the Company s common stock were reserved for issuance under the ESPP. After the initial offering period of three months, commencing September 1, 2022, eligible employees may be offered shares of common stock over a twelve-month offering period, which consists of two consecutive six-month purchase periods. Employees may purchase a limited amount (up to of shares of the Company s common stock under the ESPP at a discount of up to of the lesser of the market value of the common stock at either (a) the beginning of the six-month purchase period during which the shares of common stock are purchased or (b) the end of such six-month purchase period. As of September 30, 2024, shares of common stock remain available for issuance under the ESPP. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the grant date fair value of an award. The expected volatility of options granted has been determined using a weighted average of the historical volatility of the Company s common stock for a period equal to the expected life of the option. The expected life of options has been determined utilizing the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate is based on a zero coupon U.S. treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options. The Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its shares of common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be . The Company applied an estimated annual forfeiture rate based on historical averages in determining the expense recorded in each period.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed below in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in the other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Please refer to C autionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements on page 37 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Overview 
 Background 
 TechTarget, Inc. (the Company , we , us or our is a global data, software and analytics leader for purchase intent-driven marketing and sales data which delivers business impact for business-to-business B2B companies. Our solutions are designed to enable B2B technology companies to identify, reach, and influence key enterprise technology decision makers faster and with higher efficacy. We offer products and services intended to improve information technology IT vendors abilities to impact highly targeted audiences for business growth using advanced targeting, first-party analytics and data services complemented with customized marketing programs that integrate content creation, demand generation, brand marketing, and other advertising techniques. 
 Our goal is to enable enterprise technology and business professionals to navigate the complex and rapidly-changing enterprise technology landscape where purchasing decisions can have significant financial and operational consequences. Our content strategy includes three primary sources which enterprise technology and business professionals use to assist them in their pre-purchase research: independent content provided by our professionals, vendor-generated content provided by our customers and member-generated or peer-to-peer content. In addition to utilizing our independent editorial content, registered members and users appreciate the ability to deepen their pre-purchase research by accessing the extensive vendor-supplied content available across our virtual events, webinar channels and website network (collectively, our Network ). Likewise, these members and users can derive significant additional value from the ability our Network provides to seamlessly interact with and contribute to information exchanges. 
 We had approximately 32.7 million and 31.4 million registered members and users, which we refer to as our audiences , as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. While the size of our audiences does not provide direct insight into our customer numbers or our revenue, we believe the value of the services we sell to our customers is a direct result of the breadth and reach of this content footprint. This footprint creates the opportunity for our clients to gain business leverage by targeting our audiences through customized marketing programs. Likewise, the behavior exhibited by these audiences enables us to provide our customers with data products designed to improve their marketing and sales efforts. The targeted nature of our audiences enables B2B technology companies to reach a specialized audience efficiently because our content is highly segmented and aligned with the B2B technology companies specific products. 
 Through our ability to identify, reach and influence key decision makers, we have developed a broad customer base and, in 2024, expect to deliver marketing and sales services programs to over 2,000 customers. 
 On January 10, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Transaction Agreement with Informa PLC Informa and certain of our and their subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, we and Informa, among other things, agreed to combine our businesses with the business of Informa Intrepid Holdings Inc. Informa Tech ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Informa which will own and operate Informa s digital businesses (Industry Dive, Omdia (including Canalys)), NetLine and certain of its digital media brands (e.g. Information Week, Light Reading, and AI Business), under a new publicly traded holding company New TechTarget ). Upon closing, among other things, Informa and its subsidiaries will collectively own 57 of the outstanding common stock of New TechTarget (on a fully diluted basis) and our former stockholders will own the remaining outstanding common stock of New TechTarget. Our former stockholders will also receive a pro rata share of an amount in cash equal to 350 million plus the amount of any EBITDA adjustment (which has been determined to be 0 based upon the terms of the Transaction Agreement), which is estimated as of the date of the Transaction Agreement to be approximately 11.71 per share of our common stock. The various transactions set forth in the Transaction Agreement (the proposed transaction are expected to close in the last quarter of 2024, subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions. A special meeting will be held on November 26, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109 for TechTarget stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 18, 2024, the record date (the Special Meeting ). At the Special Meeting, our stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon proposals to approve the proposed transaction and related matters. 
 24 

We will be required to pay Informa a termination fee between 30.0 and 40.0 million if the Transaction Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, including termination by us in connection with our entry into an agreement with respect to a Toro Superior Proposal (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) prior to us receiving stockholder approval of the proposed transaction, or termination by Informa upon a Toro Change in Recommendation (as defined in the Transaction Agreement). 
 Executive Summary 
 Financial Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 3.6 million, or 2 , to 169.0 million, compared with 172.7 million, during the same period in 2023. We saw decreased customer spend across the majority of our product suite as continued macro-economic uncertainty in the technology sector remains prevalent. The amount of revenue that we derived from longer-term contracts, which we define as contracts with a term in excess of 270 days, in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 6 , compared to the third quarter of 2023, as customers continue to deploy their budgets across shorter-term solutions/products. 
 Our international geo-targeted revenue, where our target audience is outside North America International ), decreased approximately 11 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the prior year period driven by the items noted above. 
 
 Gross profit percentage was 62 and 68 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross profit decreased by 11.6 million, primarily due to a 3.6 million decrease in revenue and 7.9 million increase in cost of revenue compared to the same period a year ago. 
 Business Trends 
 The following discussion highlights key trends affecting our business. 
 Macro-economic Conditions. Because most of our customers are B2B technology companies, the success of our business is intrinsically linked to the health of, and subject to, the market conditions, of the IT industry. Despite the current uncertainty in the economy (i.e. inflation risks, higher interest rates, Russia s invasion of the Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East), there are several factors indicating positive IT spending over the next few years is likely. We believe there are several IT catalysts such as AI, security, data analytics, and cloud migrations, to name a few. Our growth continues to be driven in large part by the return on the investments we made in our data analytics suite of products, which continues to drive market share gains for us. While we will continue to invest in this growth area, management will also continue to carefully control discretionary spending such as travel and entertainment, and the filling of new and replacement positions, in an effort to maintain profit margins and cash flows. 

Industry Trends. Our business has been and is likely to continue to be impacted by macro-economic conditions. The macro-economic uncertainty has created a challenging selling environment where we have seen elongated sales cycles, budget cuts and freezes at many of our customers, which has impacted our near-term outlook. We are seeing our international markets perform worse than our domestic markets. We expect this dynamic to continue throughout 2024 because of uncertainty surrounding inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical issues internationally. 

Customer Demographics. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from our legacy global customers (a static cohort comprised of our 10 historically largest on premises hardware technology companies), decreased by approximately 7 and increased by approximately 1 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The metric measures the year-over-year increase in GAAP revenue from this cohort of customers and is calculated by dividing the GAAP revenue from this cohort of customers for the current year by the GAAP revenue from this cohort of customers for the prior year. We use this information to monitor customer concentration trends internally, which we deem an important metric for evaluating revenue diversification. Revenue from our other customers, excluding the legacy global customers described above, increased by approximately 5 and decreased by approximately 3 , compared to the same three and nine month periods in the prior year. 

25 

Our key strategic initiatives include: 
 Geographic. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 29 and 30 of our revenue was derived from internationally targeted campaigns, respectively. We continue to explore initiatives to grow our international presence. 

Product. Purchase intent data continues to drive our product road strategy. During 2024, we improved upon our Priority Engine TM offering through Account Intent Feeds, continue enhancement of our IntentMail AI offering, as well as expanding our integration offerings to sales engagement platforms.

We historically have invested our cash in money market accounts, municipal bonds, government agency bonds, U.S. Treasury securities, and corporate bonds. Other expense, net consists primarily of non-operating gains or losses, primarily related to realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses on trade assets and liabilities. 
 Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, long-lived assets, goodwill, allowance for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation, contingent liabilities, self-insurance accruals and income taxes. We base our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. In some cases, changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. A description of our critical accounting policies and estimates is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Other than those noted in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the first nine months of 2024.

Income Taxes 
 We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates expected to be in effect when such differences are settled. 
 Our net deferred tax liabilities are comprised primarily of book to tax differences on stock-based compensation, intangible asset basis, net operating loss carryforwards, valuation allowance and timing of deductions for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, research and development expenditures, accrued expenses, depreciation, and amortization.

Cost of Revenue. Cost of Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 3.0 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the following: 
 1.3 million increase in labor and related costs; 

1.5 million increase in variable costs attributable to contracted costs related to fulfilling campaigns; and 

0.4 million increase in depreciation expense. 

Gross Profit. Our gross profit is equal to the difference between our revenue and our cost of revenue for the period. Gross profit percentage was 62 and 67 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross profit decreased by 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increased cost of revenues. Because the majority of our costs are labor-related, we expect our gross profit to fluctuate from period to period depending on the total revenue for the period.

 Interest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net, increased by 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to a 0.3 million increase in interest income, a 0.4 million decrease in foreign currency exchange losses, and a 0.1 million decrease in interest expense. 
 30 

Gain on early extinguishment of debt. Gain on early extinguishment of debt relates to the repurchase of certain of our outstanding 2025 Notes. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 48.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes for 42.6 million, including transaction fees, which resulted in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of 5.0 million. No such repurchases occurred and no such gain was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Provision for income taxes. We recorded an income tax expense of 3.5 million and 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 197 and 79 , respectively. The tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 3.1 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in pretax income that resulted in a 3.0 million decrease in tax expense based on our projected effective tax rate and a decrease of 0.1 million in tax from discrete items related to stock based compensation awards.

 32 

Seasonality 
 The timing of our revenues is affected by seasonal factors, with revenues generally lower during the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters in a given year. Our revenues are seasonal primarily as a result of the annual budget approval process of many of our customers, the normal timing at which our customers introduce new products, and the historical decrease in advertising in summer months. The timing of revenues in relation to our expenses, much of which do not vary directly with revenues, has an impact on our cost of revenues, selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in each calendar quarter during the year. 
 The majority of our expenses are personnel-related and include salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and incentive-based compensation plan expenses. As a result, we have not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in the timing of our expenses period to period. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Resources 
 Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at September 30, 2024 totaled 355.8 million, a 29.5 million increase from December 31, 2023, primarily driven by the cash generated from our operating activities of 40.9 million and proceeds from ESPP of 0.6 million, offset in part by capital expenditures of 12.6 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and our cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the operations of our existing business, our potential strategic expansion internationally, future acquisitions we might undertake and any expansion into complementary businesses. To the extent that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may raise additional funds through additional bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings; provided that with certain of the foregoing actions, if we were to move forward with them, we would be required to obtain Informa s approval under the Transaction Agreement, subject to certain exceptions.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments 
 Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at September 30, 2024 were held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in pooled bond funds. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Accounts Receivable, Net 
 Our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period, which affects our cash flows from operating activities. The fluctuations vary depending on the timing with which we meet our performance obligations and on the timing of our cash collections, as well as on changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts. We use days sales outstanding DSO as a measurement of the quality and status of our receivables since lower DSO is generally correlated with higher collection rates. We define DSO as net accounts receivable at quarter end divided by total revenue for the applicable period, multiplied by the number of days in the applicable period. DSO was 64 days and 63 days at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, provisions for bad debt, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 40.9 million and 53.8 million, respectively. 
 The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of transaction-related expenses charged to earnings. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.7 million and cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 88.2 million. The change in cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by the purchase and maturity of investments and the purchase of property and equipment, primarily for internal-use software, and to a lesser extent, computer equipment. We capitalized internal-use software and website development costs of 12.2 million and 10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We have made capital expenditures primarily for computer equipment and related software needed to host our websites, internal-use software development costs, as well as for leasehold improvements and other general purposes to support our growth. Our capital expenditures totaled 12.6 million and 10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of our capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2024 were for internal-use software and website development costs and, to a lesser extent, computer equipment and related software. We capitalized internal-use software and website development costs of 12.2 million and 10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We are not currently party to any purchase contracts related to future capital expenditures. 
 Financing Activities 
 In the first nine months of 2024, cash provided by financing activities was 0.2 million due primarily to a 0.6 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock from ESPP offset by a 0.3 million increase in tax withholdings related to net share settlements. In the first nine months of 2023, we used 98.7 million for financing activities, consisting primarily of 2.3 million for the payment of contingent consideration related to our 2021 acquisitions, 4.6 million for tax withholdings related to net share settlements, 50.0 million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock and 42.6 million for the repurchase of certain of our 2025 Notes. 
 Repurchase Programs 
 In May 2022, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a stock repurchase program (the May 2022 Repurchase Program whereby we were authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to 50.0 million from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at prices and in the manner determined by management. There were no amounts purchased under this plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts remained available under the May 2022 Repurchase Program. 
 In November 2022, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a new repurchase program (the November 2022 Repurchase Program whereby we were authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock and convertible senior notes having an aggregate purchase price of up to 200.0 million from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at prices and in the manner determined by management over the next two years. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 1,318,664 shares for an aggregate purchase price of 50.0 million at an average share price of 37.90 and 48.3 million 
 34 

aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes under the November 2022 Repurchase Program. There were no amounts purchased under the November 2022 Repurchase Program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 92.9 million remained available under the November 2022 Repurchase Program. We are restricted from making any repurchases during the period between the execution of the Transaction Agreement and the closing of the proposed transaction without Informa s approval. 
 Repurchased shares were recorded under the cost method and are reflected as treasury stock in the accompanying condensed consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Convertible Senior Notes and Term Loan and Credit Facility Borrowings 
 Convertible Senior Notes 
 In December 2021, we issued 414 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.00 convertible senior notes (the 2026 Notes due December 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. Special interest, if any, is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. 
 The 2026 Notes are governed by an indenture between us, as issuer, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. The 2026 Notes are unsecured and rank senior in right of payment to our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2026 Notes and equal in right of payment to our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated. 
 Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. 
 The 2026 Notes have an initial conversion rate of 7.6043 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes. This represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately 131.50 per share of common stock and 3,148,180 shares issuable upon conversion. Throughout the term of the 2026 Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events. As of September 30, 2024, no such adjustment has occurred. Holders of the 2026 Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon conversion of a 2026 Note. 
 Proceeds from the 2026 Notes were utilized to retire 149.9 million of the 2025 Notes and for general corporate purposes. 
 In December 2020, we issued 201.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.125 convertible senior notes (the 2025 Notes due December 15, 2025, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which commenced on June 15, 2021. 
 The 2025 Notes are governed by an indenture between us, as issuer, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. The 2025 Notes are unsecured and rank senior in right of payment to our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and equal in right of payment to our unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated. 
 Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. 
 The 2025 Notes have an initial conversion rate of 14.1977 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the Notes. This represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately 70.43 per share of common stock and 2,857,447 shares issuable upon conversion of the full aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes. Throughout the term of the 2025 Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events. As of September 30, 2024, no such adjustment has occurred. Holders of the 2025 Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon conversion of a Note, except in limited circumstances. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid by cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock paid or delivered, as the case may be, to the holder upon conversion of the Notes. 
 After the induced conversion of 149.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes in December 2021, approximately 51 million of aggregate principal of 2025 Notes remain outstanding. In August 2023, we repurchased 48.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes for 42.6 million in cash including transaction fees. As of September 30, 2024, 43,163 shares were issuable upon conversion of the full aggregate principal amounts of such remaining 2025 Notes. 
 In August 2023, under the November 2022 Repurchase Program we repurchased 48.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes for 42.6 million including transaction fees, which resulted in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of 5 million. See Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements Convertible Notes and Loan Agreement for additional information. 
 
 We and New TechTarget are obligated under the Transaction Agreement to use our reasonable best efforts to enter into a revolving credit facility or other senior lending facility, which shall be entered into prior to (but effective upon) the closing of the proposed transaction, with commitments of at least 250,000,000 to be used (together with our and our subsidiaries available cash on hand) to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and for general working capital purposes.

2021 Loan Agreement 
 
 On October 29, 2021, we entered into the 2021 Loan Agreement with Western Alliance Bank. The 2021 Loan Agreement provided for a 75 million revolving credit facility with a 5 million letter-of-credit sublimit and expired on October 29, 2023. The 2021 Loan Agreement was secured by substantially all of our assets. Borrowings under the 2021 Loan Agreement bore interest based on a formula using certain market rates. The 2021 Loan Agreement was subject to various leverage and non-financial covenants. The 2021 Loan Agreement matured on its stated maturity date of October 29, 2023. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There were no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments described under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We currently have subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, Germany and France. Approximately 30 of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was derived from customers with billing addresses outside of the United States and our foreign exchange gains/losses were not significant. We currently believe our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is financially immaterial and therefore have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions. We continue to review this issue and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks through the use of currency futures or options in the future. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations. We also maintain receivables and cash accounts denominated in currencies other than the local currency, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate movements. 
 In addition, our foreign subsidiaries have certain amounts of Goodwill and Intangibles which expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These exchange rate fluctuations are included as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 At September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 355.8 million. The investments were held in bond funds and time deposits. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held for working capital purposes. We have not entered into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of increases in interest rates. Declines in interest rates, however, would reduce future investment income. 
 Inflation 
 Although we cannot accurately anticipate the future effect of inflation on our financial condition or results of operations, inflation historically has not had a material impact on our operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases for services. Our inability to do so could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 39 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024, management, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal controls that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
