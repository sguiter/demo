 , were exchanged for shares of Parasol common stock and SmartKem Limited became a wholly owned subsidiary of Parasol (the Exchange ). Business The Company is seeking to reshape the world of electronics with its disruptive organic thin-film transistors OTFTs that have the potential to revolutionize the display industry. The Company s patented TRUFLEX liquid semiconductor polymers are used to make a new type of transistor that can be used in a number of display technologies including next generation microLED displays. The Company s inks enable low temperature printing processes that are compatible with existing manufacturing infrastructure to deliver low-cost displays that outperform existing technology. The Company develops its materials at its research and development facility in Manchester, UK and provides prototyping services at the Centre for Process Innovation CPI at Sedgefield, UK. The Company entered into a technology transfer agreement (TTA) with the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan for product prototyping on its Gen2.5 fabrication line and it also has a field application office in Taiwan. The Company has an extensive IP portfolio including 125 granted patents across 19 patent families and 40 codified trade secrets. Risk and Uncertainties The Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the risk of failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the Company s business plan. The Company is subject to risks that are common to companies in the development stage, including, but not limited to, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, reliance on third party manufacturers, protection of proprietary technology and compliance with regulatory requirements. The Company has access under a framework agreement to equipment which is used in the manufacturing of demonstrator products employing the Company s inks. If the Company lost access to this fabrication facility, it would materially and adversely affect the Company s ability to manufacture prototypes and demonstrate products for potential customers. The loss of this access could significantly impede the Company s ability to engage in product development and process improvement activities. Alternative providers of similar services exist but would take effort and time to bring into the Company s operations. Going Concern The Company has incurred continuing losses including net losses of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s cash as of September 30, 2024 was million with net cash used in operating activities of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company anticipates operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future due to, among other things, costs related to research funding, further development of our technology and products and expenses related to the commercialization of our products. The Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents of million as of September 30, 2024, will not be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements and that the Company will require additional capital funding to continue

Without an active trading market, the liquidity of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock will be limited. Series A-1 and A-2 Preferred Stock and Class A and Class B Warrant Issuances On June 14, 2023, the Company and certain investors entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate of (i) shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of per share (the Series A-1 Preferred Stock ), (ii) shares of the Company s Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of per share Series A-2 Preferred Stock and together with the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock ), (iii) Class A Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of common stock (the Class A Warrant ), and (iv) Class B Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of common stock (the Class B Warrant and together with the Class A Warrant, the Warrants for aggregate gross proceeds of million (the June 2023 PIPE ). In addition, Class B Warrants were issued in lieu of cash payments for consulting services related to the offering. The fair value of the service provided was thousand. On June 22, 2023, in a second closing of the June 2023 PIPE, the Company sold an aggregate of (i) Series A-1 Preferred Stock, (ii) shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock, and (iii) Class A Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of million. In addition, Class B Warrants were issued in lieu of cash payments for consulting services related to the offering. The fair value of the service provided was thousand. Each Class A Warrant has an exercise price of and each Class B Warrant has an exercise price of , both subject to adjustments in accordance with the terms of the Warrants. The Warrants expire from the issuance date. There were an additional warrants issues related to a placement agent fee. The fair value of this fee is thousand. The Company had accounted for the Class A and Class B Warrants as derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The Company classified the Warrants as a liability because they could be considered indexed to the Company s stock due to provisions that, in certain circumstances, adjust the number of shares to be issued if the exercise price is adjusted and the existence of a pre-specified volatility input to the Black-Scholes calculation which could be used to calculate consideration in the event of a Fundamental Transaction, as defined in the agreements. Upon the Company s May 31, 2024 uplisting to the Nasdaq Capital Market the provisions relating to the adjustment in the number of shares were no longer in effect. Additionally, the Company re-evaluated the pre-specified volatility input and determined that this did not preclude the Warrants from being considered indexed to the Company s stock. As a result, the Warrants are accounted for as an equity instrument beginning on May 31, 2024.

 million. Of the net proceeds, the Company allocated an estimated fair value of million to the Warrants. The Company also expensed million of issuance costs that were allocated to the warranty liability during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The terms of the June 2023 PIPE include a number of restrictions on our operations and on our ability to raise additional capital. The Purchase Agreement, among other things, provides that, for a period ending on June 14, 2024, we may not use cash from operating activities (as defined under GAAP) of more than an average of million for any consecutive period (subject to certain exceptions). This provision may cause us to delay certain actions that may benefit our business and may prevent us from pursuing potentially favorable business opportunities, even if a majority of our board of directors believes such actions or opportunities are in the best interest of our company and our stockholders. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, for a period ending on December 15, 2025, in the event that we issue common stock or common stock equivalents in a subsequent financing (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), the significant purchasers (defined in the Purchase Agreement as a purchaser acquiring at least shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock) will have the right to purchase up to of the securities sold in the subsequent financing. This provision may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital because other investors may want to provide all, or a larger portion of the capital provided in the subsequent financing or may be unwilling to co-invest with one or more of the significant purchasers or may be unwilling to commit to provide financing without knowing how much of the subsequent financing will be provided by the significant purchasers. In addition, during such period, the Company may not issue common stock or common stock equivalents in a subsequent financing with an effective price per share of common stock that is or may become lower than the then-effective conversion price of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock without the consent of the significant purchasers, which must include AIGH and its affiliates for so long as they are holding at least in aggregate stated value of Series A-1 Preferred Stock acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. This provision may prevent the Company from obtaining additional capital on market terms even if a majority of the Company s board of directors believes that the terms of the subsequent financing are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. This provision may also have the effect of increasing the cost of obtaining additional capital either because the significant purchasers refuse to consent to any such subsequent financing unless provided by them on terms approved by them or because the Company is required to provide additional consideration to such significant purchasers in exchange for their consent. In the event that the Company issues common stock or common stock equivalents in a subsequent financing prior to the time the common stock is listed on a national securities exchange, the Purchase Agreement provides that if a significant purchaser reasonably believes that any of the terms and conditions of the subsequent financing are more favorable to an investor in the subsequent financing than the terms of the June 2023 PIPE, such significant purchaser has the right to require the Company to amend the terms of the June 2023 PIPE to include such more favorable term for such significant purchaser. This provision may make it more expensive to obtain additional capital prior to an uplisting because it permits any significant purchaser to cherry pick the terms of the subsequent financing and to require any term deemed to be more favorable to be included retroactively in the terms of the June 2023 PIPE. This provision also potentially creates uncertainty around the terms of a subsequent financing because the significant purchasers have the right to review terms of a completed subsequent financing before deciding which, if any, of the terms thereof they find more favorable to them. The Purchase Agreement provides that, until June 14, 2025, a significant purchaser may participate in a subsequent transaction by exchanging some or all of its Series A-1 Preferred Stock having a stated value equal to its subscription amount in the subsequent financing. This provision may adversely affect the amount of capital the Company raises in a subsequent financing, as it permits a significant purchaser to roll its existing investment into the new financing rather than being required to invest cash. This provision also has the potential to make it more difficult for the Company to raise additional capital as other investors may want to provide all or a larger portion of the capital provided in the subsequent financing or may require the Company to raise a minimum amount of new capital or may be unwilling to commit to provide financing without knowing how much of the subsequent financing will be provided by the significant purchasers in cash.

The Consent Agreement, the registration rights agreement, the Amended and Restated Series A-1 Certificate of Designation and the form of Class C Warrant, are attached as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 3.1 and 4.2 to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 29, 2024. The Company credited additional paid in capital million for deemed dividends as a result of (i) the exchange of Series A-1 Preferred Shares for Series C Warrants, based on the fair value of the Series C Warrants in excess of the carrying value of the preferred shares and (ii) the amendment of Series A-1 Preferred Stock accounted for as an extinguishment, based on the fair value of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock immediately before and after the amendments. The Company estimated the fair value of the deemed dividend related to the exchange of Series A-1 Preferred Stock for Series C Warrants as part of the fair value model utilized to value all the securities issued in the transaction with the stock price input estimated as of the January 26, 2024, transaction date. The Company estimated the fair value of the deemed dividend related to the amendment of preferred stock using an option pricing model based on the following assumptions: (1) dividend yield of , (2) expected volatility of , (3) risk-free interest rate of , and (4) expected life of years. As of September 30, 2024, there were an aggregate of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock outstanding. Pursuant to the terms of the Series A -2 Certificate of Designation, on May 30, 2024, the trading day immediately prior to the listing of the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the then outstanding shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock automatically converted into an aggregate of shares of common stock.

 shares to shares. The Company s Board of Directors had previously approved the 2021 Plan Amendment, subject to stockholder approval. Determining the appropriate fair value of share-based awards requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the Company s common stock, and for share options, the expected life of the option, and expected share price volatility. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value its share option awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent management s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment. As a result, if factors change and management uses different assumptions, the share-based compensation expense could be materially different for future awards. The Company did not issue any options during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued options for shares of common stock to employees, directors and consultants. The option vesting periods range from immediate to three years, have an exercise price of and expire on the ten-year anniversary of the grant date.

 Total change in the liability included in earnings ) Reclass from liability to equity ) Balance at September 30, 2024 The valuation of the warrants was determined using option pricing models. These models use inputs such as the underlying price of the shares issued at the measurement date, expected volatility, risk free interest rate and expected life of the instrument. Since our common stock was not publicly traded until February 2022 there has been insufficient volatility data available. Accordingly, we have used an expected volatility based on historical common stock volatility of our peers. The Company initially accounted for the warrants as derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, adjusting the fair value at the end of each reporting period. Upon the Company s uplisting to the Nasdaq Capital Market on May 31, 2024 certain provisions within the warrant agreements were no longer in effect. As a result, the warrants are accounted for as an equity instrument with the balance of the derivative liability on May 31, 2024 being transferred to Additional Paid-In Capital. The fair value of the common warrants was determined by using an option pricing model assuming the following: Risk-free interest rate Expected volatility Expected dividend yield Additionally, the Company had determined that the warrant liability was most appropriately classified within Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy by evaluating each input for the option pricing models against the fair-value hierarchy criteria and using the lowest level of input as the basis for the fair-value classification as called for in ASC 820. There are six inputs: closing price of the Company s common stock on the day of evaluation; the exercise price of the warrants; the remaining term of the warrants; the volatility of the Company s stock over that term; annual rate of dividends; and the risk-free rate of return. Of those inputs, the exercise price of the warrants and the remaining term are readily observable in the warrant agreements. The annual rate of dividends is based on the Company s historical practice of not granting dividends. The closing price of SmartKem stock would fall under Level 1 of the fair-value hierarchy as it is a quoted price in an active market (ASC 820-10). The risk-free rate of return is a Level 2 input as defined in ASC 820-10, while the historical volatility is a Level 3 input as defined in ASC 820. Since the lowest level input is a Level 3, the Company determined the warrant liability was most appropriately classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The following tables present information about the Company s financial assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value as of December 31, 2023 and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs utilized to determine such fair value. In general, the fair values were determined using Level 3: Total liabilities

Company Overview We are seeking to reshape the world of electronics with our disruptive organic thin-film transistors OTFTs that have the potential to revolutionize the display industry. Our patented TRUFLEX liquid semiconductor polymers are used to make a new type of transistor that can be used in a number of display technologies, including next generation microLED displays. Our inks enable low temperature printing processes that are compatible with existing manufacturing infrastructure to deliver low-cost displays that outperform existing technology. We develop our materials at our research and development facility in Manchester, UK, and provide prototyping services at the Centre for Process Innovation CPI at Sedgefield, UK. We have entered into a technology transfer agreement (TTA) with the Industrial Technology Research Institute ITRI in Taiwan for product prototyping on its Gen2.5 fabrication line. We also have a field application office in Taiwan. We have an extensive IP portfolio including 125 granted patents across 19 patent families and 40 codified trade secrets. Since our inception in 2009, we have devoted substantial resources to the research and development of materials and production processes for the manufacture of organic thin film transistors and the enhancement of our intellectual property. Our loss before income taxes was 7.6 million and 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit was 109.8 million. Substantially all our operating losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. Results of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with three months ended September 30, 2023 Revenue and Cost of revenue We had no revenue or cost of revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024. We had revenue of 3.0 thousand and cost of revenue of 1.0 thousand in the same period of 2023. Both revenues and related cost of

Table of Contents 
 revenue are a result of sales of OTFT backplanes and TRUFLEX materials for customer assessment and development purposes. Other operating income Other operating income was 0.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.3 million in the same period of 2023. The primary source of the income is related to a research grant and research and development tax credits. Operating expenses Operating expenses were 3.1 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Research and development expenses are incurred for the development of TRUFLEX inks to make OTFT circuits and consist primarily of payroll and technical development costs. The research and development expenses represent 48.1 and 53.1 of the total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Research and development expenses decreased 64 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period for the prior year. This decrease is primarily related to lower personnel expenses, offset in part by higher technical service costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and professional services such as accounting, legal services and investor relations . These expenses represent 50.5 and 42.9 of our total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period for the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in personnel expenses as well as professional service fees primarily related to business development initiatives. Non-Operating income/(expense) We had a gain of 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to the valuation of the warrant liability, with no similar gain in the same period of 2024. We recorded a loss on foreign currency of 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, with no similar loss in the same period of 2024. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with nine months ended September 30, 2023 Revenue and Cost of revenue We had revenue of 40.0 thousand and cost of revenue of 32.0 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We had revenue of 27.0 thousand and cost of revenue of 23.0 thousand in the same period of 2023. Both revenues and related cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are a result of sales of OTFT backplanes and TRUFLEX materials for customer assessment and development purposes. Other operating income Other operating income was 0.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 0.7 million in the same period of 2023. The primary source of the income is related to a research grant and research and development tax credits. Operating expenses Operating expenses were 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.3 million in the same period of 2023, an increase of 0.5 million. Research and development expenses are incurred for the development of TRUFLEX inks to make OTFT circuits and consist primarily of payroll and technical development costs. The research and development expenses represent 44.8 and 49.4 of the total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Research and development expenses decreased 0.1 million for the

 nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period for the prior year. This decrease is primarily related to lower personnel expenses, offset in part by higher technical service costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and professional services such as accounting, legal services and investor relations . These expenses represent 54.4 and 48.4 of our total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period for the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in personnel expenses as well as professional service fees primarily related to the NASDAQ uplisting and business development initiatives. Non-Operating income/(expense) We recorded a gain of 0.7 million related to the valuation of the warrant liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a gain of 0.5 million for the same period in 2023. We had transaction costs of 0.2 million related to a private placement financing for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 with no similar costs in the same period of 2024. We recorded a loss on foreign currency transactions of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to gain of 0.2 million in the same period in 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were 1.8 million compared with 8.8 million as of December 31, 2023. We believe this will not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements and that we will require additional capital funding to continue our operations and research development activity. It is possible this period could be shortened if there are any significant increases in spending or more rapid progress of development programs than anticipated. Our expected cash payments over the next twelve months include (a) 1.6 million to satisfy accounts payable and accrued expenses and (b) 0.2 million to satisfy the lease liabilities. Additional expected cash payments beyond the next twelve months include 31 thousand of lease liabilities. Our future viability is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations. We will need to obtain additional funds to satisfy our operational needs and to fund our sales and marketing efforts, research and development expenditures, and business development activities. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate sufficient cash through revenue, management s plans are to finance our working capital requirements through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our existing security holders will likely experience dilution. If we borrow money, the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations. If we enter into a collaboration, strategic alliance or other similar arrangement, we may be forced to give up valuable rights. There can be no assurance however that such financing will be available in sufficient amounts, when and if needed, on acceptable terms or at all. The precise amount and timing of the funding needs cannot be determined accurately at this time, and will depend on a number of factors, including the market demand for our products and services, the quality of product development efforts, management of working capital, and continuation of normal payment terms and conditions for purchase of services. If we are unable to substantially increase revenues, reduce expenditures, or otherwise generate cash flows for operations, then we will need to raise additional funding.

 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.4 million. The increase is related to the payout of bonuses and payments made related to the NASDAQ uplisting and business development initiatives. Contractual Payment Obligations Our principal commitments primarily consist of obligations under leases for office space and purchase commitments in the normal course of business for research and development facilities and services, communications infrastructure, and administrative services. We expect to fund these commitments from our cash balances and working capital. Critical Accounting Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), which require our management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. Fair Value Measurements GAAP emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). Our fair value measurements are generally related to a warrant liability and amendments to preferred stock. The models used for these fair value calculations use inputs such as the underlying price of the shares issued at the measurement date, expected volatility, risk free interest rate and expected life of the instrument. Since our common stock is so thinly traded there is insufficient volatility data available. Accordingly, we have used an expected volatility based on historical common stock volatility of our peers. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Not applicable.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the first quarter of 2024 a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting was identified relating to the complex financial reporting and accounting associated with the Consent, Conversion and Amendment Agreement the Company entered into on January 26, 2024, a non-cash item. None of the Company s filed financial statements are impacted. The September 30, 2024 financial statements contained in this Form 10-Q reflect the appropriate accounting for this transaction and no prior financial statements were impacted. Remediation In connection with the preparation of its quarterly report for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 management continues to implement measures designed to ensure that the control deficiency contributing to the material weakness is remediated, such that the controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. While we believe that these actions will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness, it will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed prior to the end of fiscal 2024. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting Aside from the steps taken to address the material weakness discussed above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings None Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in the 10-K may not be the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Except as set forth below there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in the 10-K. Certain of our partners are and many of our potential customers will be located in Taiwan, which increases the risk that a natural disaster, epidemic, labor strike, war or political unrest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain of our partners, including The Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan ITRI ), are located in Taiwan. In addition, we expect that many of our potential customers will be located in Taiwan, where the bulk of display manufacturing occurs. From time to time, Taiwan has been impacted by significant seismic activity in the area, including earthquakes and related aftershocks, and it is expected that similar events will happen in the future. Because of the relatively small size of Taiwan and the proximity of our partners and future customers to each other, earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, floods, other natural disasters, epidemics such as the COVID-19 outbreak, political unrest, war, labor strikes or work stoppages could simultaneously affect our partners production capability, our ability to supply our customers, and our customers ability to produce products incorporating our technology. As a result, we may be subject to unanticipated costs and delays that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We identified a material weakness in connection with our internal financial reporting controls. Although we are taking steps to remediate this material weakness, there is no assurance we will be successful in doing so in a timely manner, or at all, and we may identify other material weaknesses. In connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the first quarter of 2024 a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting was identified relating to the complex financial reporting and accounting associated with the Consent, Conversion and Amendment Agreement we entered into on January 26, 2024, a non-cash item. None of the Company s filed financial statements are impacted. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reporting. We continue to evaluate steps to remediate the material weakness. These remediation measures may be time consuming and costly and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements or guarantee that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Any failure of our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could cause our investors to lose confidence in our publicly reported information, cause the market price of our stock to decline, expose us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, or impact our results of operations.

 We can give no assurance that the measures we are taking and plan to take in the future will remediate the material weakness identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, in the future those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements. If we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements, and if we are unable to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements, including the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and the minimum stockholders equity requirement of 2.5 million set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), our shares may be delisted from Nasdaq, which could reduce the liquidity of our common stock materially and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, employees, suppliers, customers and business development opportunities. Such a delisting likely would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. Further, if we were to be delisted from Nasdaq, our common stock may no longer be recognized as a covered security, and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. Thus, delisting from Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly impact the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common shares. Our recurring losses from operations have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We have recognized recurring losses, and as of September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit of 109.8 million. We anticipate operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future due to, among other things, costs related to research funding, further development of our technology and products and expenses related to the commercialization of our products. These efforts may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to generate revenue to offset our increased operating expenses. We expect our cash and cash equivalents of 1.8 million as of September 30, 2024 to be insufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least 12 months from the filing of this 10-Q. Our forecast of the period of time through which our current financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and the costs to support our general and administrative and research and development activities are forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional working capital through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that such financing will be available, on acceptable terms and conditions, or at all. The precise amount and timing of the funding needs cannot be determined accurately at this time, and will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to generate significant revenue, the market demand for our products, the quality of product development efforts including potential joint collaborations, management of working capital, and the continuation of normal payment terms and conditions for purchase of services. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our working capital requirements through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making

 acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or products, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate commercialization, our research and product development, or grant rights to develop and market our products that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves, it may also impact our ability to continue as a going concern. The perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds On September 10, 2024, we issued 30,000 shares of common stock to a consultant with a value of 152.4 thousand. Such issuances were exempt from registration under 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not Applicable. Item 5.

 Shanghai Chip Foundation Semiconductor Technology Co., Ltd. 

Dated 26-July 2024 

Exhibit 10.1 
 This Agreement is made on 26 July 2024 Between 
 (1) SmartKem Limited (company number: 06652152) whose registered office is at Manchester Technology Center Hexagon Tower, Delaunays Road, Blackley, Manchester, England, M9 8GQ SmartKem ); and 
 (2) Shanghai Chip Foundation Semiconductor Technology Co., Ltd. incorporated and registered in Shanghai with company number 91310115320754901T whose registered office is Room 507-2, Building 3, No. 111 Xiangke Road, China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone Chip Foundation ). 
 each a party and together referred to as parties . Background: 
 (A) SmartKem designs and supplies high-performance organic semiconductor formulations and OTFT (as defined below) interlayer materials, enabling low-power, robust, flexible, and lightweight electronics. The technology platform includes high-mobility organic semiconductor molecules and inks capable of driving OTFT backplanes used in electronic displays and other applications. SmartKem also has access to processing services for manufacturing OTFT backplanes using its materials. 
 (B) Chipfoundation have three core technologies with independent intellectual property rights. Namely: Dielectric Patterned Sapphire Substrate (DPSS) technology lateral epitaxial overgrowth of GaN on DPSS technology chemical lift off GaN from DPSS technology. DPSS technology and lateral epitaxial overgrowth technology can realizable high crystal quality of GaN. Chemical lift off GaN from DPSS technology can realizable lift off of GaN epilayer from Sapphire Substrates without any damage and facilitate high yield massive transfer of Micro LEDs from sapphire substrates. It provides total solutions for the numerous engineering problems faced in the current miniaturization development process of Micro LED chips. 
 (C) Conventional MicroLED displays require Laser-Assisted Bonding (LAB) or eutectic bonding to form ohmic contacts between LED chips and driving backplanes, which leads to significant yield loss. OTFT has an intrinsic low-temperature processing feature, providing a different method to join the LED and TFT backplane, known as Chip-First Redistribution Layer (RDL) Technology. By using Chip-First RDL, metal interconnections can be formed on top of the LED using organic dielectric as sidewall encapsulation. This allows the P-N pad from the LED to be significantly enlarged, reducing the difficulties of photolithography alignment. Low-temperature OTFTs, formed on top, serve as the active-matrix driving circuitry. 
 (D) It is the intention of the parties that Chipfoundation will provide a custom MicroLED solution to Smartkem to realize the proposed new structure of the MicroLED display. Smartkem will develop a proprietary organic dielectric formulation to help Chipfoundation establish its MIP (MicroLED in Package) product portfolio.
