 A detailed description regarding the Company's fair value measurements is contained in Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 The Company offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a non-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan. A participant's deferrals, together with Company matching credits, are invested in a variety of participant-directed stock and bond mutual funds that are classified as trading securities. The trading securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the changes in the fair value of these securities are measured using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, exclusive of any transaction costs.

million of additional consideration dependent upon the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks through 2028 and up to an additional million of consideration dependent upon the Company receiving reimbursement coverage from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"). The portion of the contingent consideration obligation which is dependent upon the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks was measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo method and is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined based on significant inputs that are not observable. Significant inputs include management s estimate of revenue and other market inputs, including comparable company revenue volatility and a discount rate ). The portion of the contingent consideration obligation which is dependent upon the Company receiving reimbursement coverage from the CMS is also classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is principally determined based on management's estimate, which is a significant input that is not observable. Additionally, the fair value of the entire contingent consideration obligation is also impacted by a market discount rate which adjusts the estimated payments to present value. The fair value of the contingent consideration obligation is not overly sensitive to movements in the comparable company revenue volatility or the discount rate used for the portion of the obligation that is dependent upon the achievement of certain revenue benchmarks. For example, changing the comparable company revenue volatility from to impacts the fair value by million (assuming no other inputs are modified) and changing the discount rate from to impacts the fair value by million (assuming no other inputs are modified). 
 
 The Company has additional contingent consideration obligations in connection with other acquisitions. The liabilities related to such obligations are included in the amounts below.

Of the aggregate million contingent consideration obligation as of December 31, 2023, million and million were included in other liabilities and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 In connection with the sale of an noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to UMass Memorial Medical Center ("UMass") on July 1, 2015, the Company granted UMass the right to require the Company to purchase all of its interest in the subsidiary at fair value commencing July 1, 2020. As of September 30, 2024, the redeemable noncontrolling interest was presented at its fair value. The fair value measurement of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis that takes into account, among other items, the joint venture's expected future cash flows, long term growth rates, and a discount rate commensurate with economic risk. 
 
 The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value based on the short maturities of these instruments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Company s debt was estimated at billion and billion, respectively. Principally all of the Company's debt is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value of the debt is estimated based on rates currently offered to the Company with identical terms and maturities, using quoted active market prices and yields, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments.

These gains are deferred in stockholders' equity, net of taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense, net over a period. 
 
 Interest Rate Derivatives Fair Value Hedges 
 
 Historically, the Company has entered into various fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in order to convert a portion of the Company's long-term debt into variable interest rate debt. All such fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements have been terminated and proceeds from the terminations have been reflected as basis adjustments to the hedged debt instruments and are being amortized as a reduction of interest expense, net over the remaining terms of such debt instruments. 

(a) As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the entire balance is associated with remaining unamortized hedging adjustments on discontinued relationships. 
 
 During October 2024, the Company entered into various fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the Company's long-term debt into variable interest rate debt. See Note 14 for further details.

 The Company remains subject to contingent obligations under certain real estate leases for which no liability has been recorded. For further details, see Note 19 to the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Certain Legal Matters 
 
 The Company may incur losses associated with these proceedings and investigations, but it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of loss, if any, that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, or other resolution of these proceedings and investigations based on the stage of these proceedings and investigations, the absence of specific allegations as to alleged damages, the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class, if applicable, and/or the lack of resolution of significant factual and legal issues. The Company has insurance coverage rights in place (limited in amount; subject to deductible) for certain potential costs and liabilities related to these proceedings and investigations. 
 
 In 2020, putative class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey against the Company and other defendants with respect to the Company s 401(k) plan. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the fiduciaries of the 401(k) plan breached their duties by failing to disclose the expenses and risks of plan investment options, allowing unreasonable administration expenses to be charged to plan participants, and selecting and retaining high cost and poor performing investments. In October 2020, the court consolidated the lawsuits under the caption In re: Quest Diagnostics ERISA Litigation and plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. In May 2021, the court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint. After discovery was completed, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted. 
 
 On June 3, 2019, the Company reported that Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau, Inc./American Medical Collection Agency AMCA had informed the Company and Optum360 LLC that an unauthorized user had access to AMCA s system between August 1, 2018 and March 30, 2019 (the AMCA Data Security Incident ). Optum360 provides revenue management services to the Company, and AMCA provided debt collection services to Optum360. AMCA first informed the Company of the AMCA Data Security Incident on May 14, 2019. AMCA s affected system included financial information (e.g., credit card numbers and bank account information), medical information and other personal information (e.g., social security numbers). Test results were not included. Neither Optum360 s nor the Company s systems or databases were involved in the incident. AMCA also informed the Company that information pertaining to other laboratories customers was also affected. Following announcement of the AMCA Data Security Incident, AMCA sought protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws. The bankruptcy proceeding has been dismissed. 
 
 Numerous putative class action lawsuits were filed against the Company related to the AMCA Data Security Incident. The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the cases that were then still pending to, and consolidated them for pre-trial proceedings in, the U.S. District Court for New Jersey. In November 2019, the plaintiffs in the multidistrict proceeding filed a consolidated putative class action complaint against the Company and Optum360 that named additional individuals as plaintiffs and that asserted a variety of common law and statutory claims in connection with the AMCA Data Security Incident. In January 2020, the Company moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint; the motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which the Company also moved to dismiss. The motion was granted in part and denied in part. Discovery is proceeding.

 While the basis for claims reserves is actuarially determined losses based upon the Company's historical and projected loss experience, the process of analyzing, assessing and establishing reserve estimates relative to these types of claims involves a high degree of judgment. Although the Company believes that its present reserves and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures, it is possible that the Company may incur liabilities in excess of its recorded reserves or insurance coverage. Changes in the facts and circumstances associated with claims could have a material impact on the Company s results of operations (principally costs of services), cash flows and financial condition in the period that reserve estimates are adjusted or paid.

 of the Company s total net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions. The DIS business, which provides clinical testing services and other services, satisfies its performance obligations and recognizes revenues primarily upon completion of the testing process (when results are reported) or when services have been rendered. The Company estimates the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to receive from payer customer groups in exchange for providing services using the portfolio approach. These estimates include the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Our Company 
 
 Diagnostic Information Services 
 
 Quest Diagnostics works across the healthcare ecosystem to create a healthier world, one life at a time. Our diagnostic information services ("DIS") business provides diagnostic insights from the results of our laboratory testing to empower people, physicians, and organizations to take action to improve health outcomes. Derived from one of the world's largest databases of de-identifiable clinical lab results, our diagnostic insights reveal new avenues to identify and treat disease, inspire healthy behaviors and improve healthcare management. In the right hands and with the right context, our diagnostic insights can inspire actions that transform lives and create a healthier world. We provide services to a broad range of customers within our primary customer channels - physicians (including those associated with accountable care organizations and Federally Qualified Health Centers), hospitals, and patients and consumers. Our other customers include health plans, employers, emerging retail healthcare providers, government agencies, pharmaceutical companies and other commercial clinical laboratories. We offer broad access to clinical testing through a nationwide network of laboratories, patient service centers, phlebotomists in physician offices, and our connectivity resources, including call centers and mobile phlebotomists, nurses and other health and wellness professionals. Our large in-house staff of medical and scientific experts, including medical directors, scientific directors, genetic counselors and board-certified geneticists, provide medical and scientific consultation to healthcare providers and patients regarding our tests and test results, and help them best utilize our services to improve outcomes and enhance satisfaction. Our DIS business makes up greater than 95 of our consolidated net revenues. 
 
 We assess our revenue performance for our DIS business based upon, among other factors, volume (measured by test requisitions) and revenue per requisition. Each test requisition accompanies patient specimens, indicating the test(s) to be performed and the party to be billed for the test(s). Revenue per requisition is impacted by various factors, including, among other items, the impact of fee schedule changes (i.e., unit price), test mix, payer mix, business mix and the number of tests per requisition. Management uses number of requisitions and revenue per requisition data to assist with assessing the growth and performance of the business, including understanding trends affecting number of requisitions, pricing and test mix. Therefore, we believe that information related to changes in these metrics from period to period are useful information for investors as it allows them to assess the performance of the business. 
 
 Diagnostic Solutions 
 
 Our diagnostic solutions ("DS") group, which represents the balance of our consolidated net revenues, includes our risk assessment services business, which offers solutions for insurers, and our healthcare information technology businesses, which offer solutions for healthcare providers and payers.

 Cost of Services 
 
 Cost of services consists principally of costs for obtaining, transporting and testing specimens as well as facility costs used for the delivery of our services. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of servi ce s increased by 136 million comp ared to the prior year period. T he increase wa s primar ily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions, wage increases, higher supplies expense, and lower performance-based compensation in the prior year period, partially offset by cost savings and productivity improvements from our Invigorate program. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of servi ce s increased by 218 million com pared to the prior year period. T he increase wa s primari ly driven by the impact of recent acquisitions, wage increases, higher supplies expense, and lower performance-based compensation in the prior year period, partially offset by cost savings and productivity improvements from our Invigorate program. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG A") 
 
 SG A consist principally of the costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts, billing operations, credit loss expense and general management and administrative support as well as administrative facility costs.

Table of Contents 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, SG A increased by 68 million compared to the prior period. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions, lower performance-based compensation in the prior year period, and higher costs associated with changes in the value of our deferred compensation obligations. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG A increased by 69 million compared to the prior period. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions, lower performance-based compensation in the prior year period, higher costs associated with changes in the value of our deferred compensation obligations and higher depreciation expense. 
 
 The changes in the value of our deferred compensation obligations is largely offset by changes in the value of the associated investments, which are recorded in other income (expense), net. For further details regarding our deferred compensation plans, see Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Amortization Expense 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, amo rtization expense increased by 5 million and 9 million, respectively, compared to the prior year periods, as a result of recent acquisitions. 
 
 Other Operating Expense, Net 
 
 Other operating expense, net includes miscellaneous income and expense items and other charges related to operating activities. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , other operating expense, net primarily represents losses associated with the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with previous acquisitions. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense, net increased by 9 million and 24 million, respectively, compared to the prior year periods primarily due to the issuance during November 2023 of 750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.40 senior notes due 2033 and the issuance during August 2024 of 1.85 billion of Senior Notes (see "Third Quarter Highlights" above for further details), partially offset by increased interest income (principally due to higher cash on hand) and lower borrowings under our secured receivables credit facility. 
 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 
 Other income (expense), net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to non-operating activities, such as gains and losses associated with investments and other non-operating assets. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income (expense), net included 6 million and 18 million, respectively, of gains associated with investments in our deferred compensation plans. Additionally, both periods included an 8 million gain associated with a foreign exchange forward contract utilized in conjunction with an acquisition. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, other income (expense), net included 3 million of losses and 9 million of gains, respectively, associated with investments in our deferred compensation plans. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 65 million and 68 million, respectively. 
 
 The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 21.9 and 22.8 , respectively.

 Equity in Earnings of Equity Method Investees, Net of Taxes 
 
 Equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was principally consistent with the prior year period. 
 
 Equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes, decreased by 4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 including 11 million of losses associated with changes in the carrying value of our strategic investments, partially offset by increased demand for testing services at our diagnostic information services joint venture.

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We address our exposure to market risks, principally the risk of changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We seek to mitigate the variability in cash outflows that result from changes in interest rates by maintaining a balanced mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt obligations. In order to achieve this objective, we have historically entered into interest rate swap agreements. Interest rate swap agreements involve the periodic exchange of payments without the exchange of underlying principal or notional amounts. Net settlements are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense, net. We believe that our exposures to foreign exchange impacts and changes in commodity prices are not material to our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our debt was estimated at approximately 6.3 billion and 4.6 billion, respectively, principally using quoted prices in active markets and yields for the same or similar types of borrowings, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value was more than (less than) the carrying value of the debt by 32 million and (127) million, respectively. A hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates (representing 32 basis points and 50 basis points as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) would potentially reduce the estimated fair value of our debt by approximately 178 million and 139 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Borrowings under our secured receivables credit facility and our senior unsecured revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates. Interest on our secured receivables credit facility is based on either commercial paper rates for highly-rated issuers or the adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("Term SOFR"), plus a spread. Interest on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility is based on certain published rates plus an applicable margin based on changes in our public debt ratings. As such, our borrowing cost under this credit arrangement is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in our public debt ratings. As of September 30, 2024, the borrowing rates under these debt instruments were: for our secured receivables credit facility, commercial paper rates for highly-rated issuers or the adjusted Term SOFR, plus a spread of 0.80 ; and for our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the adjusted Term SOFR, plus 1.00 . As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the secured receivables credit facility and there were no borrowings outstanding under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility. 
 
 Based on our net exposure to interest rate changes, a hypothetical 10 change to the variable rate component of our variable rate indebtedness would not materially change our annual interest expense. 
 
 For further details regarding our outstanding debt, see Note 7 to the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements and Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For details regarding our financial instruments and hedging activities, see Note 8 to the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements and Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Risk Associated with Investment Portfolio 
 
 Our investment portfolio primarily includes equity investments comprised mostly of strategic holdings in companies concentrated in the life sciences and healthcare industries. Equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded in current earnings in our consolidated statement of operations. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values (which consist of investments in preferred and common shares of private companies) are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes. 
 
 We regularly evaluate equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values to determine if there are any indicators that the investments are impaired. The carrying value of our equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values was 37 million as of September 30, 2024. In conjunction with the preparation of our September 30, 2024 financial statements, we considered whether the carrying values of our investments were impaired and concluded that no such impairment existed. 
 
 We do not hedge our equity price risk. The impact of an adverse movement in equity prices on our holdings in privately held companies cannot be easily quantified as our ability to realize returns on investments depends on, among other things, the enterprises ability to raise additional capital or derive cash inflows from continuing operations or through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers or private sales.

 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly-liquid short-term investments with original maturities, at the time of acquisition, of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 totaled 764 million, compared to 686 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 13 of our 764 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held outside of the United States. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 870 million and 745 million, respectively. The 125 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period, was primarily a result of lower income tax payments and lower performance-based compensation payments. 
 
 Days sales outstanding, a measure of billing and collection efficiency, was 49 days as of September 30, 2024, 50 days as of of December 31, 2023 and 50 days as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.0 billion and 947 million, respectively. This 1.1 billion increase in net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period, was primarily a result of increased cash used for business acquisitions (see "Third Quarter Highlights" above for further details), partially offset by decreased capital expenditures. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1.3 billion and 30 million, respectively. This 1.2 billion increase in net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period, was primarily a result of the issuance of 1.85 billion of Senior Notes during August 2024 (see "Third Quarter Highlights" above for further details). Such issuance was partially offset by the nine months ended September 30, 2024 including the repayment in full of the outstanding indebtedness under our 300 million of 4.25 senior notes at maturity and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 including 278 million of net borrowings under our secured receivables credit facility. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings or repayments under our secured receivables credit facility and our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we borrowed 1.6 billion under our secured receivables credit facility, 1.3 billion of which was repaid prior to September 30, 2023. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we borrowed 125 million under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which was repaid prior to September 30, 2023. 
 
 Dividend Program 
 
 39 

Table of Contents 

During each of the first three quarters of 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.75 per common share. During each of the four quarters of 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.71 per common share. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 1.0 billion remained available under our share repurchase authorization. The share repurchase authorization has no set expiration or termination date. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we repurchased no shares of our common stock. 
 
 Equity Method Investees 
 
 Our equity method investees primarily consist of a diagnostic information services joint venture and an investment in a fund that purchases strategic holdings in private companies in the healthcare industry. Such investees are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our investment in equity method investees is less than 5 of our consolidated total assets. Our proportionate share of income before income taxes associated with our equity method investees is less than 5 of our consolidated income before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity method investees. We have no material unconditional obligations or guarantees to, or in support of, our equity method investees and their operations. 
 
 In conjunction with the preparation of our September 30, 2024 financial statements, we considered whether the carrying values of our equity method investments were impaired and concluded that no such impairment existed. 
 
 Requirements and Capital Resources 
 
 We estimate that we will invest approximately 420 million during 2024 for capital expenditures, to support and grow our existing operations, principally related to investments in laboratory equipment and facilities, including laboratory automations and information technology to support our diagnostic offerings. 
 
 We have 600 million of 3.50 senior notes due March 2025. 
 
 Additionally, on October 13, 2024, we completed the acquisition of select assets of the outreach laboratory services business of OhioHealth in an all-cash transaction for 200 million. We have also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire select assets of the outreach laboratory services business of University Hospitals, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. For further details, see Notes 5 and 14 to the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.3 billion of borrowing capacity available under our existing credit facilities, including 527 million available under our secured receivables credit facility and 750 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under either the secured receivables credit facility or the senior unsecured revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. In support of our risk management program, 73 million in letters of credit under the secured receivables credit facility were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our secured receivables credit facility is subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, and certain financial covenants with respect to the receivables that comprise the borrowing base and secure the borrowings under the facility. Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility is also subject to certain financial covenants and limitations on indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such applicable financial covenants. 
 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will provide sufficient financial flexibility to fund seasonal and other working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other obligations, cash dividends on common shares, share repurchases and additional growth opportunities, including acquisitions, for the foreseeable future. However, should it become necessary, we believe that our credit profile should provide us with access to additional financing in order to fund normal business operations, make interest payments, fund additional growth opportunities, including acquisitions, and satisfy upcoming debt maturities.

Any disposition by a requesting party (as defined below) after the date of the Stockholder Meeting Request or after a request to fix a Stockholder Meeting Request Record Date, as the case may be, of any shares of Common Stock (or, in the case of a stockholder making a Stockholder Meeting Request or a request to fix a Stockholder Meeting Request Record Date on behalf of the beneficial owner of shares, any disposition by such beneficial owner of beneficial ownership of such shares) shall be deemed a revocation of the Stockholder Meeting Request and any request to fix a Stockholder Meeting Request Record Date, as the case may be, with respect to such shares. 
 
 For the purposes of this Paragraph 7, net long position shall be determined with respect to each stockholder making a Stockholder Meeting Request and each beneficial owner, if any, who is directing such stockholder to act on such owner s behalf (each stockholder and owner, a requesting party in accordance with the definition thereof set forth in Rule 14e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended from time to time (the Exchange Act ), provided that (x) for purposes of such definition, in determining such requesting party s short position, the reference in Rule 14e-4 to the date that a tender offer is first publicly announced or otherwise made known by the bidder to holders of the security to be acquired shall be deemed to be the Stockholder Meeting Request Record Date, and the reference to the highest tender offer price or stated amount of the consideration offered for the subject security shall be deemed to refer to the closing sales price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (or such other securities exchange designated by the Board of Directors if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange) on such Stockholder Meeting Request Record Date (or, if such date is not a trading day, the next succeeding trading day) and (y) the net long position of such requesting party shall be reduced by the number of shares as to which the Board of Directors determines that such requesting party does not, or will not, have the right to vote or direct the vote as of the Stockholder Meeting Request Record Date or as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting to be called pursuant to the Stockholder Meeting Request, or as to which the Board of Directors determines that such requesting party has entered into any derivative or other agreement, arrangement or understanding that hedges or transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such shares. 
 
 Whenever this Paragraph 7 or Paragraph 8 of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of the Bylaws requires one or more persons (including a record or beneficial owner of capital stock of the Corporation) to give or deliver any notice, request, consent (including any Consent (as defined below)), revocation, or any other documents or materials (the Documents to the Corporation or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents, unless the Corporation consents or requests otherwise, such Documents shall be in writing and shall be delivered exclusively by hand (including, without limitation, overnight courier service) or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and not by electronic transmission or any other means.

For purposes of this Paragraph 8, net long position shall be determined with respect to each Written Consent Requesting Stockholder (and each beneficial owner, if any, who is directing such stockholder to act on such owner s behalf in accordance with the definition thereof set forth in Rule 14e-4 under the Exchange Act provided that (x) for purposes of such definition, in determining such Written Consent Requesting Stockholder s (or beneficial owner s) short position, the reference in Rule 14e-4 to the date that a tender offer is first publicly announced or otherwise made known by the bidder to holders of the security to be acquired shall be deemed to be the Written Consent Request Record Date, and the reference to the highest tender offer price or stated amount of the consideration offered for the subject security shall be deemed to refer to the closing sales price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (or such other securities exchange designated by the Board of Directors if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange) on such Written Consent Request Record Date (or, if such date is not a trading day, the next succeeding trading 
 6 

day) and (y) the net long position of such Written Consent Requesting Stockholder (or such beneficial owner) shall be reduced by the number of shares as to which the Board of Directors determines that such Written Consent Requesting Stockholder (or such beneficial owner) does not, or will not, have the right to vote or direct the vote as of the Written Consent Request Record Date or the Written Consent Record Date (as defined below), or as to which the Board of Directors determines that such Written Consent Requesting Stockholder (or such beneficial owner) has entered into any derivative or other agreement, arrangement or understanding that hedges or transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such shares. Following the date on which the Corporation shall have received Written Consent Request(s) representing the Requisite Percent in accordance herewith (the Written Consent Request Effective Time ), the Board of Directors shall, by the later of (i) twenty (20) days after the Written Consent Request Effective Time and (ii) five (5) days after 
 delivery to the Corporation by any Written Consent Requesting Stockholder of any information requested by the Corporation to determine the validity of such Written Consent Request(s) (the later of the dates in the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), the Determination Outside Date ), determine the validity of such Written Consent Request(s) (including whether such Written Consent Requests were delivered in accordance with this Certificate of Incorporation and whether the proposed action is a proper matter for stockholder action under this Certificate of Incorporation) and, if appropriate, adopt a resolution fixing the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to the action(s) set forth in such Written Consent Request(s) (the Written Consent Record Date (unless the Board of Directors shall have previously fixed such a Written Consent Record Date). The Written Consent Record Date shall be no more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing such record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and shall not precede the date upon which such resolution is adopted. If the Board of Directors determines that Written Consent Requests from Written Consent Requesting Stockholders representing the Requisite Percent have been validly delivered in accordance with this Certificate of Incorporation and relate to an action that may be effected by consent in lieu of a meeting pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation, or if no such determination shall have been made by the Determination Outside Date, and in either event no Written Consent Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the Written Consent Record Date shall be the first date following the Determination Outside Date on which a signed Consent relating to the action taken or proposed to be taken by consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting pursuant to the Written Consent Request is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with paragraph (g) of this Paragraph 8 and applicable law. 
 
 (c) Each Written Consent Requesting Stockholder shall include with his, her or its Written Consent Request written evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation of his, her or its ownership of shares of Common Stock as of the Written Consent Request Record Date and continuous net long position as required by paragraph (b) of this Paragraph 8 (provided, however, that if any Written Consent Requesting Stockholder is not the beneficial owner of the shares as to which any Written Consent Request is made, then such Written Consent Request must also include documentary evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation as to such ownership by the beneficial owner on whose behalf such request is made). Each Written Consent Requesting Stockholder (or the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf a Written Consent Request is made) must include with his, her or its Written Consent Request an agreement by such Written Consent Requesting Stockholder (or the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf a Written Consent Request is made) to solicit Consents in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Paragraph 8 provided that an agreement by one such Written Consent Requesting Stockholder 
 7 

(or beneficial owner) shall be deemed to constitute such agreement on the part of all such Written Consent Requesting Stockholders. Each Written Consent Request must describe the action proposed to be taken by consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting and contain all such information and representations, to the extent applicable, with respect to each Written Consent Requesting Stockholder (and each beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf a Written Consent Request is made) and the proposed action of stockholders by consent in lieu of a meeting as would be required by the Bylaws to present any item of business (other than the election of directors) before a meeting of stockholders, as applicable, including, without limitation, a detailed summary of the proposed action to be taken (including the text of any resolutions to be adopted by written consent of stockholders and, if any resolution proposes to amend the Bylaws, the exact language of any such proposed amendment). The Corporation may require each Written Consent Requesting Stockholder to furnish such other information as may be requested by the Corporation to determine the validity of any Written Consent Request and whether any proposed action set forth in the Written Consent Request may be effected by consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting under paragraph (d) of this Paragraph 8. In connection with an action or actions proposed to be taken by consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting in accordance with this Paragraph 8 and applicable law, each Written Consent Requesting Stockholder shall further update and supplement the information previously provided to the Corporation in connection therewith so that it is true and correct (i) as of the Written Consent Record Date and (ii) as of each tenth day thereafter until the earlier of the date each action is duly adopted and the Consent Termination Date (as defined below), with such updated or supplemental information being delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation at its principal executive office in the manner required in this Paragraph 8 within five (5) business days after the date as of which the information is required to be updated or supplemented. Any Written Consent Requesting Stockholder may revoke his, her or its Written Consent Request at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporation s principal executive offices. Any disposition by a Written Consent Requesting Stockholder of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to consent to the action to which a Written Consent Request relates (or, in the case of a Written Consent Requesting Stockholder that has submitted a Written Consent Request on behalf of the beneficial owner of shares, a disposition by such beneficial owner of beneficial ownership of such shares) after the date of the Written Consent Request shall be deemed a revocation of his, her or its Written Consent Request with respect to such shares. If, at any time after the Written Consent Request Effective Time and before the Written Consent Certification Date (as defined below), the Written Consent Request(s) represent in the aggregate less than the Requisite Percent due to any revocation of a Written Consent Request or any deemed revocation of shares of Common Stock with respect to any such request, no Written Consent Record Date shall be fixed (and any Written Consent Record Date theretofore fixed shall be cancelled), and no action by consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting as provided in such Written Consent Request(s) shall be taken pursuant thereto. In determining whether Written Consent Request(s) have been delivered by Written Consent Requesting Stockholders representing in the aggregate the Requisite Percent in accordance with this Paragraph 8, multiple Written Consent Requests delivered to the Secretary will be considered together only if each such Written Consent Request (x) identifies substantially the same purpose or purposes of the action proposed to be taken by consent of stockholders and substantially the same matters proposed to be taken by written consent of stockholders, as determined by the Board of Directors (which, if such purpose is the removal of one or more directors, will mean that each Written Consent Request includes an identical list of directors proposed to be removed by the action by consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting that is the 
 8 

subject of the request), and (y) has been dated and delivered to the Secretary as provided herein on the Written Consent Request Record Date or within thirty (30) days thereafter. 
 
 (d) Stockholders shall not be entitled to act by consent in lieu of a meeting if (i) the action relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law, (ii) the Written Consent Request Effective Time occurs during the period commencing one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the first anniversary of the annual meeting of stockholders for the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the thirtieth (30th) calendar day after the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting, (iii) an identical or substantially similar item (as determined by the Board of Directors, a Similar Item was presented at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation held not more than twelve (12) months before the Written Consent Request Record Date in respect of any Written Consent Request (provided that, for purposes of this clause (iii), an election of directors at any such meeting shall not be deemed to be a Similar Item with respect to any proposal to remove one or more directors), (iv) the action relates to a removal of directors occurring at any time within 90 days after any meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, (v) a Similar Item is included in the Corporation s notice as an item of business to be brought before a meeting of stockholders that has been called by the Written Consent Request Record Date in respect of a Written Consent Request but has not yet been held or that is called for a date within ninety (90) days after the Written Consent Request Effective Time, (vi) the Board of Directors calls an annual or special meeting of stockholders for purposes of presenting a Similar Item or solicits action by written consent of stockholders of a Similar Item pursuant to paragraph (i) of this Paragraph 8 or (vii) the Written Consent Request(s) otherwise giving rise to a Written Consent Request Effective Time were made in a manner that either did not comply with this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law. 
 
 (e) Stockholders of the Corporation may take action by consent in lieu of a meeting only if consents are solicited by (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) the Written Consent Requesting Stockholder or group (or the beneficial owner(s), if any, on whose behalf any such Written Consent Requesting Stockholder is acting) seeking to take action by written consent of stockholders in accordance with this Paragraph 8, Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act (without reliance upon any exemption in Regulation 14A, including the exemption contained in clause (iv) of Rule 14a-1(l)(2) or Rule 14a-2(b) thereunder) (or any subsequent provisions replacing such act or regulations) and any other applicable law, from all holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to give consent the proposed action. 
 
 (f) No Consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless such Consent is dated and delivered to the Corporation in accordance with this Paragraph 8 and applicable law and, within sixty (60) days after the first date on which a Consent is validly delivered in the manner required by paragraph (g) of this Paragraph 8 and applicable law (and in any event not later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Written Consent Record Date), Consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are so delivered to the Corporation. A Consent shall not be valid if it purports to provide (or if the person signing such Consent provides, through instructions to an agent or otherwise) that it will be effective at a future time or at a time determined upon the happening of an event. 
 
 9 

(g) No Consents may be delivered to the Corporation until (i) sixty (60) days after the Written Consent Request Effective Time, or (ii) such later date as may be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, which determination shall be conclusive and binding, in the event it concludes, consistent with its fiduciary duties, that additional time is required for stockholders to make an informed decision in connection with such Consent. Consents must be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation. In the event of the receipt by the Corporation of one or more Consents, the Secretary of the Corporation, or such other officer of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate, shall provide for the safe-keeping of such Consents and any related revocations and shall promptly conduct such ministerial review of the sufficiency of all Consents and any related revocations and of the validity of the action to be taken by consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting as the Secretary of the Corporation or such other officer deems necessary or appropriate to determine whether the stockholders of a number of shares of capital stock having the requisite voting power to authorize or take the action specified in Consents have given consent. The Board of Directors may appoint an independent person to serve as inspector Inspector to conduct the ministerial review referenced in the immediately preceding sentence, and such Inspector shall provide a report with respect to such review to the Corporation promptly upon the completion thereof. Subject to paragraph (h) of this Paragraph 8, if, after completion of the review required by this paragraph (g), the Secretary of the Corporation or such other officer as the Board of Directors shall have designated shall determine that the action purported to have been taken is duly authorized by the Consents, the Secretary or such other officer shall certify that fact on the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders and the Consents shall be filed in such records. No action by consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting shall be effective until such date as the Secretary or such other officer certifies to the Corporation that the Consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with this paragraph (g) represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, in accordance with the General Corporation Law, the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws (the Written Consent Certification Date ). 
 
 (h) If the Board of Directors shall determine, which determination shall be conclusive and binding, that any Written Consent Request or any proposed action by consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting was not properly made or effected in accordance with this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or applicable law, including, without limitation, due to the fact that one or more Written Consent Requests or Consents were not delivered in compliance with the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or applicable law regulating action by consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting, then the Board of Directors shall not be required to fix a Written Consent Record Date and any such purported action by consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting shall be null and void to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Nothing contained in this Paragraph 8 shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any Consent or related revocations, whether before or after such certification by the Secretary of the Corporation, such other officer of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate or the Inspectors, as the case may be, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement or prosecution of any action, suit or proceeding, or the defense of any litigation, with respect thereto, and the seeking of a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief or other remedy at law or in equity). 
 
 10 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, (x) none of the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 8 or any related provisions of the Bylaws shall apply to any solicitation of stockholder action by written consent by or at the direction of the Board of Directors and (y) the Board of Directors shall be entitled to solicit action by consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting in accordance with applicable law. 
 
 9. Bylaws. The Board of Directors shall have the right to make, alter or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation, subject to the right of the stockholders of the Corporation to alter or repeal any Bylaw made by the Board of Directors. 
 
 10. Elections . The election of directors of the Corporation need not be by written ballot, unless the Bylaws of the Corporation otherwise provide. 
 
 11. Indemnification. 
 
 (a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director or officer of the Corporation shall have any personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer. 
 
 (b) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action either in an official capacity as a director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as a director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators provided, however, that the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to be indemnified conferred in this Paragraph 11 shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by the director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is to be rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan), in advance of the final disposition of proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Paragraph or otherwise. The 
 11 

Corporation may also provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers. 
 
 (c) The indemnification provided by this Paragraph 11 shall not limit or exclude any rights, indemnities or limitations of liability to which any person may be entitled, whether as a matter of law, under the By-Laws of the Corporation, by agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors of the Corporation or otherwise. 
 
 (d) If a claim under paragraph (b) of this Paragraph 11 is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard or conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
