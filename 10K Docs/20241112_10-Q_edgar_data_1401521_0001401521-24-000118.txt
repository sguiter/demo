 wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries. On July 10, 2023, we changed our corporate name from United Insurance Holdings Corp. to American Coastal Insurance Corporation. Our two insurance subsidiaries are Interboro Insurance Company (IIC), acquired via acquisition on April 29, 2016; and American Coastal Insurance Company (AmCoastal), acquired via merger on April 3, 2017. 
 
 Our other subsidiaries include United Insurance Management, L.C. (UIM), a managing general agent; Skyway Claims Services, LLC (SCS), which provides claims adjusting services to our insurance companies; AmCo Holding Company, LLC (AmCo) which is a holding company subsidiary that consolidates its respective insurance company; BlueLine Cayman Holdings (BlueLine), which reinsures portfolios of excess and surplus policies; UPC Re, which provides a portion of the reinsurance protection purchased by our insurance subsidiaries when needed; Skyway Reinsurance Services, LLC, which provides reinsurance brokerage services for our insurance companies; Skyway Legal Services, LLC (SLS), which provides claims litigation services to our insurance companies; and Skyway Underwriters, LLC, a managing general agent that provides technological and distribution services to our insurance companies. 
 
 On May 9, 2024, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Sale Agreement") with Forza Insurance Holdings, LLC (Forza) in which ACIC will sell and Forza will acquire 100 of the issued and outstanding stock of IIC. The aggregate purchase price for the shares will be equal to IIC's GAAP shareholders' equity on the closing date. Closing is subject to customary closing conditions, including New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval of Forza's application for acquisition of control, and NYDFS approval of a new rate and form filing. As a result, IIC results of operations and assets and liabilities are captured within discontinued operations and are discussed in Note 3 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements below. 
 
 On February 27, 2023, our former insurance subsidiary, United Property Casualty Insurance Company (UPC) was placed into receivership with the Florida Department of Financial Services (DFS), which divested our ownership of UPC. The events leading to receivership and results of this subsidiary, now included within discontinued operations, are discussed in Note 3 below. 
 
 Our primary products are commercial and homeowners' residential property insurance. We currently offer commercial residential insurance in Florida and personal residential insurance in New York. As a result of the Sale Agreement described above and resulting in classification of IIC as discontinued operations, the remaining activity captured within continuing operations supports only our commercial residential insurance offerings. Given this fact pattern, as of September 30, 2024, we conduct our operations under one reportable segment. Our chief operating decision maker is our President. 
 
 (b) Consolidation and Presentation 
 
 We prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We have condensed or omitted certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. In management's opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring items, considered necessary for a fair presentation of interim periods. We include all of our subsidiaries in our consolidated financial statements, eliminating intercompany balances and transactions during consolidation. As described in Note 3 , our subsidiary, IIC, and our former subsidiary, UPC, and activities related directly to supporting the business conducted by UPC qualified as discontinued operations. Our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and footnotes should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and footnotes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 While preparing our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Reported amounts that require us to make extensive use of estimates include our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, investments and goodwill. Except for the

 On August 25, 2022, we announced that our former subsidiary, UPC, had filed plans for withdrawal in the states of Florida, Louisiana, and Texas and intended to file a plan for withdrawal in the state of New York. All filed plans entailed non-renewing personal lines policies in these states. Additionally, we announced that Demotech, an insurance rating agency, notified UPC of its intent to withdraw UPC's Financial Stability Rating. On December 5, 2022, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation issued Consent Order No. 303643-22- CO that provided for the administrative supervision and approval of the plan of run-off for UPC (the "Consent Order"). The Consent Order provided formal approval of UPC's Plan of Run-Off (the "Plan") to facilitate a solvent wind down of its affairs in an orderly fashion. On February 10, 2023, we announced that a solvent run-off of UPC was unlikely, driven by Hurricane Ian losses which exhausted UPC's reinsurance coverage. On February 27, 2023, UPC was placed into receivership with the DFS which divested our ownership of UPC. 
 
 In the first quarter of 2023, the assets and liabilities of UPC were divested. In addition, activities provided by our entities, SCS, SLS and UIM, related directly to supporting the business conducted by UPC were included. The remaining assets for the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 are presented as held for disposal, and the results of UPC and activities related directly to supporting the business conducted by UPC are presented as discontinued operations for all periods.

As of February 28, 2023, the Company completed the disposal of its former subsidiary, UPC. This divestiture resulted in a gain of for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This gain was driven by the negative equity position of UPC prior to the divestiture.

 (1) The Company divested its ownership on February 27, 2023, the date the DFS was appointed as receiver of the entity. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, due to a change in circumstances, the Company evaluated its capitalized software, previously classified as held for disposal at December 31, 2023. As a result of this evaluation, it was determined that the use case of the software by the Company has shifted. The Company has reclassified this asset and the associated amortization expense in the current period presented within this footnote in accordance with GAAP guidance, resulting in amortization expense for the capitalized software being captured in continuing operations prospectively. Property and equipment of at December 31, 2023 was also reclassed at March 31, 2024, before current quarter amortization. 
 
 In addition to the item related to capitalized software noted above, there were no non-cash transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, amortization attributed to discontinued operations totaled and , respectively.

 Portfolio Monitoring 
 
 We have a quarterly portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed-income security whose carrying value may be impaired as a result of a credit loss. For each fixed-income security in an unrealized loss position, if we determine that we intend to sell the security or that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the cost or amortized cost basis for reasons such as liquidity needs, contractual or regulatory requirements, the security's entire decline in fair value is recorded in earnings. 
 
 If management decides not to sell the fixed-income security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the fixed-income security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. This is typically indicated by a change in the rating of the security assigned by a rating agency, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security or industry, among other factors. If the assessment indicates that a credit loss may exist, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses will be recorded in earnings. Credit loss is limited to the difference between a security's amortized cost basis and its fair value. Any additional impairment not recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive loss. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we determined that none of our fixed-income securities shown in the table below that are in an unrealized loss position have declines in fair value that are reflected as a result of credit losses. Therefore, no credit loss allowance was recorded at September 30, 2024. The issuers of our debt security investments continue to make interest payments on a timely basis. We do not intend to sell, nor is it likely that we would be required to sell the debt securities before we recover our amortized cost basis. Equity securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the valuation of equity investments.

Fair Value Measurement 
 
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The hierarchy for inputs used in determining fair value maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Assets and liabilities recorded on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value are categorized in the fair value hierarchy based on the observability of inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: 
 
 Level 1: Assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that we can access. 
 
 Level 2: Assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following: 
 (a) Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; 
 (b) Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or 
 (c) Valuation models whose inputs are observable, directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
 
 Level 3: Assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect our estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the assets and liabilities. 
 
 We estimate the fair value of our investments using the closing prices on the last business day of the reporting period, obtained from active markets such as the NYSE, Nasdaq and NYSE American. For securities for which quoted prices in active markets are unavailable, we use a third-party pricing service that utilizes quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, benchmark interest rates, broker quotes and other relevant inputs to estimate the fair value of those securities for which quoted prices are unavailable.

 Composition of reserve for unpaid losses and LAE: Case reserves IBNR reserves Balance at September 30 

Based upon our internal analysis and our review of the annual statement of actuarial opinion provided by our actuarial consultants at December 31, 2023, we believe that the reserve for unpaid losses reasonably represents the amount necessary to pay all claims and related expenses which may arise from incidents that have occurred as of the balance sheet date. 
 As reflected in the table above, we had favorable development in both 2024 and 2023 related to prior year losses. This favorable development came as a result of re-estimating ultimate losses in 2024 and 2023 based on historical loss trends. The prior year loss payments made by the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were higher than the loss

The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. We may redeem the Senior Notes at our option, at any time and from time to time in whole or in part, prior to September 15, 2027, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon from the date of redemption to the date that is three months prior to maturity, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. On or after that date, we may redeem the Senior Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. On December 8, 2022, the Kroll Bond Rating Agency, LLC announced a downgrade of our issuer and debt ratings from BBB- to BB+. As a result, pursuant to our agreement, the interest rate of our Senior Notes increased from 6.25 to 7.25 . 
 
 Financial Covenants 
 
 Our Senior Notes provide that the Company and its subsidiaries shall not incur any indebtedness unless no default exists and the Company s leverage ratio as of the last day of any annual or quarterly period (the balance sheet date) immediately preceding the date on which such additional indebtedness is incurred would have been no greater than 0.3:1, determined on a pro forma basis as if the additional indebtedness and all other indebtedness incurred since the immediately preceding balance sheet date had been incurred and the proceeds therefrom applied as of such day. The Company and its subsidiaries also may not create, assume, incur or permit to exist any indebtedness for borrowed money that is secured by a lien on the voting stock of any significant subsidiary without securing the Senior Notes equally. The Company may not issue, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the capital stock of the Company s significant subsidiaries as of the issue date of the Senior Notes (except to the Company or to one or more of the Company s other subsidiaries, or for the purpose of qualifying directors or as may be required by law or regulation), subject to certain exceptions. At December 31, 2023, while our leverage ratio was greater than the allowed ratio above, we did not incur any additional indebtedness during the period and as a result, we were in compliance with the covenants in the Senior Notes.

 We previously leased and occupied office space in which we no longer operate. Effective October 1, 2022, this office space was subleased to a third-party. The sublease was effective from October 1, 2022 through July 31, 2025, with no option to extend. However, on February 29, 2024, this sublease was cancelled as a part of an agreement to terminate the original lease associated with the office space. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized of income related to this sublease, exclusive of the lease expense associated with the original lease. 
 
 Employee Retention Credit 
 
 A series of legislation was enacted in the United States during 2020 and 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that provided financial relief for businesses impacted by government-mandated shutdowns, work stoppages, or other losses suffered by employers. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provided an employee retention credit, which is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes of up to 5,000 per employee for eligible employers. The tax credit is equal to 50 of qualified wages paid to employees during a quarter, capped at 10,000 of qualified wages per employee. During the second quarter of 2022, we evaluated our eligibility and filed for a refund in connection with our Employee Retention Tax Credit for the tax year ended December 31, 2021. As of September 30, 2024, we have received from the IRS related to this refund. A gain contingency is an uncertain situation that will be resolved in the future, possibly resulting in a gain. We have not recognized this gain contingency of within our financial statements except for the that has already been received. 
 
 Quota Share Commission Loss Contingency 
 
 AmCoastal participates in shared quota-share reinsurance agreements with our former subsidiary, UPC, which are subject 
 to a variable ceding commission based on loss experience. With the receivership of UPC in 2023, we have not received data 
 related to UPC losses that could unfavorably shift AmCoastal s commission related to these contracts. In addition, we cannot 
 reasonably determine how this shift will be allocated between the contracted parties. Until we receive this loss data and provide 
 the updated calculations to both our reinsurance partners and the DFS, as receiver of UPC, we are unable to estimate the impact, 
 however, we believe a loss contingency related to these commissions may exist as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We will continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the outcome of these contingencies and will make any appropriate adjustments each quarter.

Each restricted stock unit and performance stock unit represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of common stock upon vesting. 
 
 Performance stock units vest based on the Company's return on average equity compared to a defined group of peer companies. On the grant date, we issue the target number of performance stock units. They are subject to forfeitures if performance goals are not met. The actual number of performance stock units earned can vary from zero to 150 percent of the target for the awards.

Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the revised items of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed as Exhibit 99.1 to Form 8-K on October 4, 2024. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties. See "Forward-Looking Statements." 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 Overview 
 
 American Coastal Insurance Corporation (referred to in this document as we, our, us, the Company or ACIC) is a holding company primarily engaged in commercial and personal property and casualty insurance business with investments in the United States. On July 10, 2023, we changed our corporate name from United Insurance Holdings Corp. to American Coastal Insurance Corporation. We conduct our business principally through our two wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries: American Coastal Insurance Company (AmCoastal) and Interboro Insurance Company (IIC). Collectively, we refer to the holding company and all our subsidiaries, including non-insurance subsidiaries, as American Coastal Insurance Corporation, which is the preferred brand identification for our Company. 
 
 Our Company s primary source of revenue is generated from writing insurance in Florida and New York. Our target market in such areas consists of states where the perceived threat of natural catastrophe has caused large national insurance carriers to reduce their concentration of policies. We believe an opportunity exists for ACIC to write profitable business in such areas. 
 
 On May 9, 2024, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Sale Agreement") with Forza Insurance Holdings, LLC (Forza) in which ACIC will sell and Forza will acquire 100 of the issued and outstanding stock of IIC. The aggregate purchase price for the shares will be equal to IIC's shareholders' equity under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) on the closing date. Closing is subject to customary closing conditions, including New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval of Forza's application for acquisition of control, and NYDFS approval of a new rate and form filing. As a result, IIC results of operations and assets and liabilities are captured within discontinued operations and can be seen in Note 3 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements above. 
 
 On February 27, 2023, our former insurance subsidiary, United Property Casualty Insurance Company (UPC) was placed into receivership with the Florida Department of Financial Services (DFS), which divested our ownership of UPC. The events leading to receivership and results of this subsidiary, now included within discontinued operations, can be seen in Note 3 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements above. 
 
 We have historically grown our business through strong organic growth, complemented by strategic acquisitions and partnerships, including our acquisitions of AmCo Holding Company, LLC (AmCo) and its subsidiaries, including AmCoastal, in April 2017 and IIC in April 2016. 
 
 Our policies in-force decreased by 1.7 from 23,162 policies in-force at September 30, 2023 to 22,775 policies in-force at September 30, 2024. These values include IIC policies in-force, whose results are captured within discontinued operations. For more information regarding the concentration of our policies in force, please see the discontinued operations and results of operations sections below. 
 
 The following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the consolidated financial position and results of operations of American Coastal Insurance Corporation. In evaluating our results of operations, we use premiums written and earned, policies in-force and new and renewal policies by geographic concentration. We also consider the impact of catastrophe losses and prior year development on our loss ratios, expense ratios and combined ratios. In monitoring our investments, we use credit quality, investment income, cash flows, realized gains and losses, unrealized gains and losses, asset diversification and portfolio duration. To evaluate our financial condition, we consider our liquidity, financial strength, ratings, book value per share and return on equity.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 We believe that investors' understanding of ACIC's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP measures. Our methods for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. 
 
 Combined ratio excluding the effects of current year catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (underlying combined ratio) is a non-GAAP measure, that is computed by subtracting the effect of current year catastrophe losses and prior year development from the combined ratio. We believe that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to highlight the trends in our business that may be obscured by current year catastrophe losses and prior year development. Current year catastrophe losses cause our loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their frequency of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio. Prior year development is caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves. We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio should not be considered as a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business. 
 
 Net loss and LAE excluding the effects of current year catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (underlying loss and LAE) is a non-GAAP measure, that is computed by subtracting the effect of current year catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development from net loss and LAE. We use underlying loss and LAE figures to analyze our loss trends that may be impacted by current year catastrophe losses and prior year development on our reserves. As discussed previously, these two items can have a significant impact on our loss trends in a given period. We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net loss and LAE. The underlying loss and LAE measure should not be considered a substitute for net loss and LAE and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business. 
 
 Net income (loss) excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets, income (loss) from discontinued operations, realized gains (losses) and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net of tax (core income (loss)) is a non-GAAP measure, which is computed by adding amortization, net of tax, to net income (loss) and subtracting income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, realized gains (losses) on our investment portfolio, net of tax, and unrealized gains (losses) on our equity securities, net of tax, from net income (loss). Amortization expense is related to the amortization of intangible assets acquired, including goodwill, through mergers and therefore the expense does not arise through normal operations. Investment portfolio gains (losses) and unrealized equity security gains (losses) vary independent of our operations. We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss). The core income (loss) measure should not be considered a substitute for net loss and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 When we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP, we must make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts we report. Certain of these estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex. As a result of that subjectivity and complexity, and because we continuously evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on a variety of factors, actual results could materially differ from our estimates and assumptions if changes in one or more factors require us to make accounting adjustments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reassessed our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in Note 2 to the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We have made no material changes or additions with regard to those policies and estimates. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 
 Please refer to Note 2 in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards that may affect us.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION - SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2023 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related notes, and in conjunction with the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the revised items of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed as Exhibit 99.1 to Form 8-K on October 4, 2024. 

Investments 
 
 The primary goals of our investment strategy are to preserve capital, maximize after-tax investment income, maintain liquidity and minimize risk. To accomplish our goals, we purchase debt securities in sectors that represent the most attractive relative value, and we maintain a moderate equity exposure. Limiting equity exposure manages risks and helps to preserve capital for two reasons: first, bond market returns are less volatile than stock market returns, and second, should the bond issuer enter bankruptcy liquidation, bondholders generally have a higher priority than equity holders in a bankruptcy proceeding. 
 
 We must comply with applicable state insurance regulations that prescribe the type, quality and concentrations of investments our insurance subsidiaries can make; therefore, our current investment policy limits investment in non-investment-grade fixed maturities and limits total investment amounts in preferred stock, common stock and mortgage notes receivable. We do not invest in derivative securities. 
 
 Two outside asset management companies, which have authority and discretion to buy and sell securities for us, manage our investments subject to (i) the guidelines established by our Board of Directors and (ii) the direction of management. The Investment Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and approves our investment policy on a regular basis. 
 
 Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investment portfolio totaled 571,113,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to 311,874,000 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 The following table summarizes our investments, by type: 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Estimated Fair Value Percent of Total Estimated Fair Value Percent of Total U.S. government and agency securities 157,721 27.6 26,002 8.3 Foreign government 439 0.1 States, municipalities and political subdivisions 16,798 2.9 16,964 5.4 Public utilities 4,764 0.8 3,288 1.1 Corporate securities 56,822 10.1 48,026 15.3 Mortgage-backed securities 32,490 5.7 34,622 11.1 Asset-backed securities 9,339 1.6 9,485 3.0 Total fixed maturities 278,373 48.8 138,387 44.2 Mutual funds 25,950 4.5 Total equity securities 25,950 4.5 Other investments 26,392 4.6 16,487 5.3 Total investments 330,715 57.9 154,874 49.5 Cash and cash equivalents 183,147 32.1 138,930 44.5 Restricted cash 57,251 10.0 18,070 5.8 Total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments 571,113 100.0 311,874 100.0 
 
 We classify all of our fixed-maturity investments as available-for-sale. Our investments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted mainly of U.S. government and agency securities, states, municipalities and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities and securities of investment-grade corporate issuers. Our equity holdings as of September 30, 2024 consist of mutual funds. We held no equities as of December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, approximately 87.8 of our fixed maturities were U.S. Treasuries or corporate bonds rated A or better, and 12.2 were corporate bonds rated BBB or "BB", including our investments held in discontinued operations.

Reinsurance 
 
 We follow the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our risks. Reinsurance involves transferring, or "ceding", all or a portion of the risk exposure on policies we write to another insurer, known as a reinsurer. To the extent that our reinsurers are unable to meet the obligations they assume under our reinsurance agreements, we remain primarily liable for the entire insured loss under the policies we write. 
 
 Our catastrophe reinsurance coverage consists of three separate placements: 
 
 1. AmCoastal s core catastrophe reinsurance program in effect June 1 through May 31, annually, which includes excess of loss and quota share treaties providing coverage for catastrophe losses from named or numbered windstorms; 
 
 2. AmCoastal s all other perils catastrophe excess of loss agreement in effect January 1 through December 31, annually, which provides protection from catastrophe loss events other than named or numbered windstorms and earthquakes; and 
 
 3. IIC s core catastrophe reinsurance program in effect June 1 through May 31, annually, which provides protection from all catastrophe losses. 
 
 This reinsurance protection is an essential part of our catastrophe risk management strategy. It is intended to provide our stockholders with an acceptable return on the risks assumed by our insurance entities, and to reduce the variability of earnings, while providing surplus protection. Although reinsurance agreements contractually obligate our reinsurers to reimburse us for the agreed-upon portion of our gross paid losses, they do not discharge our primary liability. In the event one or more of our reinsurers fail to fulfill their obligation, the surplus of our statutory entities may decline, and we may not be able to fulfill our obligation to policyholders, or we may not be able to maintain compliance with various regulatory financial requirements. Additionally, we face the risk that actual losses incurred from one or more catastrophic events may be above the modeled expected loss resulting in losses exceeding our reinsurance coverage, which may result in a decline in surplus, and as a result we may not be able to fulfill our obligations to policyholders, or we may not be able to maintain compliance with various regulatory financial requirements. The details of our programs and the likelihood of a catastrophic event exceeding these three coverages are outlined below. 
 
 AmCoastal s core catastrophe reinsurance program provides occurrence-based coverage up to an exhaustion point of approximately 1,260,000,000 for a first occurrence and 1,610,000,000 in the aggregate. Under this program, our GAAP retention on a first event is 20,500,000 10,000,000 retained by AmCoastal under statutory accounting principles (STAT retained), 10,500,000 retained separately by our captive). We have purchased second and third event retrocession coverage, reducing our second and third event GAAP retentions to 13,000,000 10,000,000 STAT retained by AmCoastal, 3,000,000 retained separately by our captive). AmCoastal s program provides sufficient coverage for approximately a 1-in-206-year return period, indicating that the probability of a single occurrence exceeding protection purchased is roughly 0.5 estimated by equally blending the AIR and RMS catastrophe models using long-term catalogs including demand surge. AmCoastal s program also provides sufficient coverage for a 1-in-100-year event followed by a 1-in-50-year event in the same treaty year, the probability of which is less than 0.1 . While we believe these catastrophe models are very good tools and their output provides reasonable proxies for the probability of exhausting our reinsurance protections, they are imperfect, so actual results could vary dramatically from those expected. 
 
 AmCoastal s all other perils catastrophe excess of loss agreement provides protection from catastrophe loss events other than named windstorms and earthquakes up to 172,000,000 in the aggregate. This agreement provides sufficient coverage for a 1-in-450-year return period, indicating that the probability of a single occurrence exceeding protection purchased is no more than 0.2 . 
 
 IIC s core catastrophe reinsurance program, which is reported under discontinued operations, provides coverage up to an exhaustion point of approximately 82,500,000 in the aggregate, with a retention of 2,500,000 per occurrence. Based on IIC s PML, the program provides sufficient coverage for two 1-in-130-year events in the same season, indicating the probability of a single occurrence exceeding protection purchased is no more than 0.1 . 
 
 Effective December 15, 2023, we agreed to commute a private reinsurer s share of core catastrophe reinsurance coverage and replace this gap in coverage with new coverage provided by one of our other private reinsurers. This transaction resulted in 
 39 

AMERICAN COASTAL INSURANCE CORPORATION 

additional expense of approximately 6,300,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, and a reduction in expense of approximately 6,300,000 and 15,700,000 during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Where we think prudent, particularly where, premium rates are high relative to the risk, we retain risk whereby AmCoastal purchases reinsurance from UPC Re, our captive reinsurance entity. UPC Re participates on AmCoastal's all other perils catastrophe excess of loss agreement and AmCoastal's excess per risk agreement. In addition, UPC Re participates in a 30 quota share agreement with AmCoastal, which provides coverage for all catastrophe perils as well as attritional losses incurred. The table below outlines the participation of UPC Re for each program, including premium received and capital at risk.

Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustments 
 
 We generally use the term loss(es) to collectively refer to both loss and LAE. We establish reserves for both reported and unreported unpaid losses that have occurred at or before the balance sheet date for amounts we estimate we will be required to pay in the future, including provisions for claims that have been reported but are unpaid at the balance sheet date and for obligations on claims that have been incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. Our policy is to establish these loss reserves after considering all information known to us at each reporting period. At any given point in time, our loss reserve represents our best estimate of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of our insured claims incurred and unpaid. 
 
 Unpaid losses and LAE totaled 173,322,000 and 347,738,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, unpaid losses related to IIC totaled 21,356,000 and 22,483,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which have been classified as discontinued operations. 
 
 Since the process of estimating loss reserves requires significant judgment due to a number of variables, such as fluctuations in inflation, judicial decisions, legislative changes and changes in claims handling procedures, our ultimate liability will likely differ from these estimates. We revise our reserve for unpaid losses as additional information becomes available, and reflect adjustments, if any, in our earnings in the periods in which we determine the adjustments as necessary. 
 
 See Note 9 in our Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our losses and loss adjustments. 

Discontinued Operations 
 
 On February 10, 2023, we announced that a solvent run-off for UPC was unlikely and on February 27, 2023, UPC was placed into receivership with the DFS, which divested our ownership of UPC.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - COMPARISON OF THE THREE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 

ACIC net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 17,551,000, or 166.1 , to net income of 28,119,000 for the third quarter of 2024 from 10,568,000 for the same period in 2023. Of this income, 27,669,000 is attributable to continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 12,654,000 from 15,015,000 for the same period in 2023. Quarter-over-quarter revenues increased, driven by a decrease in ceded premiums earned, and increases in net investment income and unrealized gains on equity securities. This was offset by increased expenses quarter-over-quarter, driven by an increase in policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses. In addition, the Company's provision for income taxes increased quarter-over-quarter. The Company's income from discontinued operations, also contributed to this change in net income, increasing 4,897,000 quarter-over-quarter, as the deconsolidation of UPC is not impacting the Company in 2024.

AMERICAN COASTAL INSURANCE CORPORATION 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 We generate cash through premium collections, reinsurance recoveries, investment income, the sale or maturity of invested assets, the incurrence of debt and the issuance of additional shares of our stock. We use our cash to pay reinsurance premiums, claims and related costs, policy acquisition costs, salaries and employee benefits, other expenses and stockholder dividends, acquire subsidiaries and pay associated costs, as well as to repay debts, repurchase stock and purchase investments. 
 
 As a holding company, we do not conduct any business operations of our own and, as a result, we rely on cash dividends or intercompany loans from our management subsidiaries to pay our general and administrative expenses. Insurance regulatory authorities heavily regulate our insurance subsidiaries, including restricting any dividends paid by our insurance subsidiaries and requiring approval of any management fees our insurance subsidiaries pay to our management subsidiaries for services rendered; however, nothing restricts our non-insurance company subsidiaries from paying us dividends other than state corporate laws regarding solvency. Our management subsidiaries pay us dividends primarily using cash from the collection of management fees from our insurance subsidiaries, pursuant to the management agreements in effect between those entities. In accordance with state laws, our insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends or make distributions out of that part of their statutory surplus derived from their net operating profit and their net realized capital gains. The Risk-Based Capital (RBC) guidelines published by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners may further restrict our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make distributions if the amount of the intended dividend or distribution would cause their respective surplus as it regards policyholders to fall below minimum RBC guidelines. See Note 13 in our Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made capital contributions of 1,265,000 to its reinsurance subsidiary, UPC Re. We may make future contributions of capital to our insurance subsidiaries as circumstances require. The Company made no capital contributions to its subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 In September 2023, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement (the Agreement with Raymond James Associates, Inc., as agent (the Agent ), of up to 8,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Shares ). Sales of the Shares under the Agreement will be made in sales deemed to be at the market offerings . The Agent is not required to sell any specific amount of Shares but has agreed to act as the Company s sales agent for a commission equal to 3.0 of the gross proceeds from the sales of the Shares. As of September 30, 2024, 4,373,000 shares had been sold under the Agreement resulting in commissions paid of approximately 1,181,000 and net proceeds of approximately 38,190,000. The Agreement will terminate upon the issuance and sale of all Shares subject to the Agreement, or the Agreement may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 

Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions)

AMERICAN COASTAL INSURANCE CORPORATION 

Operating Activities 
 
 The principal cash inflows from our operating activities come from premium collections, reinsurance recoveries and investment income. The principal cash outflows from our operating activities are the result of claims and related costs, reinsurance premiums, policy acquisition costs and salaries and employee benefits. A primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is the risk of large magnitude catastrophe events. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced cash inflows of 241,907,000 compared to cash outflows of 184,889,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was driven by normal business operations, such as premium collections. Claims payments were offset by reinsurance recovery collections, with the net inflow from these activities totaling approximately 18,176,000. In addition, during the first quarter of 2023, we disposed of UPC, resulting in a gain on disposal adjustment of 238,440,000. There was no similar transaction in 2024. 

Investing Activities 
 
 The principal cash inflows from our investing activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of investments. We closely monitor and manage these risks through our comprehensive investment risk management process. The principal cash outflows relate to sales of investments. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors and market disruption. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net purchases of investments totaled 162,893,000 compared to net sales of investments of 263,877,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These net sales in 2023 were offset by the disposition of 232,582,000 in cash related to the receivership of UPC. 

Financing Activities 
 
 The principal cash outflows from our financing activities come from repayments of debt and payments of dividends. The primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is market disruption in the cost and availability of credit. We believe our current capital resources, together with cash provided from our operations, are sufficient to meet currently anticipated working capital requirements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities totaled 11,621,000, compared to 38,000 provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in inflow in 2024 is attributed to the proceeds received from the issuance of our common stock, primarily under our at the market program described above. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or material changes to our contractual obligations during the quarter. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risks, including interest rate risk related to changes in interest rates in our fixed-maturity securities, credit risk related to changes in the financial condition of the issuers of our fixed-maturities and equity price risk related to changes in equity security prices. These risks are disclosed in Part II, Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 We held no equity securities as of December 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, we began investing in equity securities. As of September 30, 2024, our equity portfolio consists of mutual funds totaling 25,950,000. We had no other material changes in our market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. We designed our disclosure controls with the objective of ensuring we accumulate and communicate this information to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

AMERICAN COASTAL INSURANCE CORPORATION 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on our evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 
 Existence of Material Weakness as of March 31, 2023 
 
 During the second quarter of 2023, the Company identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to the reporting of the discontinued operations as of March 31, 2023. Specifically, the Company s controls over the review of significant unusual transactions, including the effects of the transactions on the preparation of the Company's tax provision were not designed effectively. The Company did not have sufficient, experienced accounting resources to effectively review the accounting for and reporting of significant, unusual transactions. As a result of the material weakness, management s review control did not detect an error in the accounting related to the recording of the discontinued operations and as a result, net income was understated by 6.4 million. In 2023, the Company restated its consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to reflect the correction of this error. 
 
 Remediation Plan 
 
 Since identifying the material weakness related to management s review controls related to significant, unusual and complex transactions in the preparation of the Company's financial statements, management has begun remediation of the process and controls in place to measure and record transactions and their related effects to income tax accounting to enhance the effectiveness of the design and operation of those controls. The Company will focus on the accounting and disclosure for unusual and complex transactions such as discontinued operations and will continue to augment existing staff with additional skilled accounting resources and strengthen the review process to improve the design and operation of financial reporting and corresponding internal controls. 
 
 These remediation measures require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over 
 a sustained period of financial reporting to reach a determination that the material weakness has been remediated. As we continue to validate and test our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine that additional measures or modifications to the remediation plan are necessary or appropriate. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control performed during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are involved in routine claims-related legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue amounts resulting from claims-related legal actions in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses during the period that we determine an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and we can estimate the amounts. Management makes revisions to our estimates based on its analysis of subsequent information that we receive regarding various factors, including: (i) per claim information; (ii) company and industry historical loss experience; (iii) judicial decisions and legal developments in the awarding of damages; and (iv) trends in general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. 
 
 On October 20, 2023, we received notice that the DFS filed a notice of claim and demand for tender of insurance policy limits under our director and officer insurance to carriers participating in our director and officer s insurance program (the Claim ). The Claim alleges that former officers and directors of UPC were involved in wrongful acts that resulted in UPCs insolvency and demands immediate tender of our director and officer s policy limit of 40,000,000 where we have a retention of 1,500,000. The former directors and officers of UPC deny the allegations. Although no litigation has arisen from the Claim, litigation is anticipated. The directors and officers plan to vigorously defend against the Claim; however, due to our indemnification obligation, during 2023 we accrued the policy retention amount of 1,500,000. This claim remains open as of September 30, 2024.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I. Item 1A " Risk Factors " of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as set forth below. 
 
 The insurance industry is heavily regulated and further restrictive regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth. 
 
 The insurance industry is extensively regulated and supervised. Insurance regulatory authorities generally design insurance rules and regulations to protect the interests of policyholders, and not necessarily the interests of insurers, their stockholders, and other investors. This regulation relates to authorization for lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, investment limitations, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurance company's business. We are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in Florida and New York, the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, as well as all states in which they are licensed. The regulations of each state are unique and complex and subject to change, and certain states may have regulations that conflict with the regulations of other states in which we operate. As a result, we are subject to the risk that compliance with the regulations in one state may not result in compliance with the regulations in another state. 
 
 We strive to maintain all required licenses and approvals. However, we may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations. The relevant authority's interpretation of the laws and regulations also may change from time to time. Regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to impose fines, and grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the required licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, these authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. In addition, we may face individual and class action lawsuits by insured and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. 
 
 State statutes and administrative rules generally require each insurance company to register with the department of insurance in its state of domicile and to furnish information concerning the operations of the companies within the holding company system. Failure to comply with such requirements may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers. As part of its registration, each insurance company must identify material agreements, relationships and transactions with affiliates, including loans, investments, asset transfers, transactions outside of the ordinary course of business, certain management, service, and cost sharing agreements, reinsurance transactions, dividends, and other financial and non-financial components of an insurer s business. Some states impose restrictions or require prior regulatory approval of specific corporate actions, which may adversely affect our ability to operate, innovate, obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner or grow our business profitably. For example, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (the Office notified our subsidiary, American Coastal Insurance Company and its officers and directors, that it was required to show why those officers and directors were not a substantial contributing cause of the insolvency of our former subsidiary, United Property Casualty Insurance Company, pursuant to section 624.4073 Fla. Stat., which prohibits officers and directors of insolvent insurers from serving as officers or directors of another insurer unless that officer or director demonstrates that their actions or omissions were not a significant contributing cause of the insolvency. We have been in discussions with the Office and continue working with the Office on this issue. Our ability to comply with these laws and regulations, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is, and will continue to be, critical to our success. 
 
 Currently, the federal government s role in regulating or dictating the policies of insurance companies is limited. However, from time to time Congress has considered and may in the future consider proposals that would increase the role of the federal government in insurance regulation, either in addition to or in lieu of state regulation. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the U.S. Department of Treasury Department to collect data on the insurance industry, recommend changes to the state system of insurance regulation and preempt certain state insurance laws. The potential impact on our business as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the FIO s current and future recommendations remains unclear; however, the implementation of any federal insurance regulations that constrain our business opportunities or reduce investment flexibility could negatively impact our business. 
 
 In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. Changes in federal legislation, regulation and/or administrative policies in several areas, including changes in financial services regulation 
 54 

AMERICAN COASTAL INSURANCE CORPORATION 

and federal taxation, could negatively affect the insurance industry and us. In addition, Congress and some federal agencies from time to time investigate the current condition of insurance regulation in the United States to determine whether to impose federal or national regulation or to allow an optional federal charter, similar to the option available to most banks. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators continually reexamine existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. We cannot predict what effect, if any, proposed or future legislation or NAIC initiatives may have on the manner in which we conduct our business. 
 
 As part of potential, or future, industry-wide investigations, we may from time to time receive requests for information from government agencies and authorities at the state or federal level. If we are subpoenaed for information by government agencies and authorities, potential outcomes could include law enforcement proceedings or settlements resulting in fines, penalties and/or changes in business practices that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, these investigations may result in changes to laws and regulations affecting the industry. 
 
 Changes to insurance laws or regulations, or new insurance laws and regulations, may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and could significantly increase our compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our prospects for future growth. Additionally, our failure to comply with certain provisions of applicable insurance laws and regulations could result in significant fines or penalties being levied against us and may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any unregistered equity securities or repurchase any of our equity securities. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 
 None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 
 Not applicable.
