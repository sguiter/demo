million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash used in operating activities was approximately million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a working capital deficit of million which compares to million as of December 31, 2023. Late in the third quarter of 2022, the Company secured a term loan in the amount of million. Additionally, the Company secured an asset based line of credit with a million credit limit subject to accounts receivable and inventory balances. The term loan and asset based line of credit were secured in order to augment the Company's liquidity, as needed, through the execution of management's transformation plan. The Company's initial draw on the term loan was million taken in 2022 and as of September 30, 2024, million (net of repayments) has been drawn on the asset based line of credit. The unused committed capacity under the asset based line of credit is approximately million as of September 30, 2024 , however, actual borrowing availability at any time is subject to advance rates on accounts receivable and inventory balances. amount remained available to draw under the term loan as of September 30, 2024. See Note 5 for a description of the asset based line of credit and Note 6 for a description of the term loan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company issued an aggregate of million in principal amount of unsecured convertible promissory notes (the Convertible Notes to select accredited investors to fund operations. The aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes is inclusive of million from related parties. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company issued million in principal amount of an unsecured promissory note (the Nonconvertible Note to a related party to fund operations. See Note 6 for further discussion. The Company is currently evaluating several different strategies to enhance our liquidity position. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, pursuing additional actions under our business transformation plan, seeking additional financing from both the public and private markets through the issuance of equity securities and seeking to extend the term of outstanding debt. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the capital it needs to continue its operations on satisfactory terms or at all. In November 2024, the Company closed on a public offering receiving gross proceeds of approximately million before deducting estimated offering expenses; however, the Company needs additional funding to execute its business plan and continue operations. If capital is not available to the Company when, and in the amounts needed, the Company could be required to liquidate our inventory and assets, cease or curtail operations, which could materially harm its business, financial condition and results of operations, or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws or similar state proceedings. The Company has prepared cash flow forecasts which indicate that based on its expected operating losses and cash consumption in order to fund working capital growth, the Company believes that absent an infusion of sufficient capital there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months after the date the condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 are issued. The Company's plan includes the items noted above as well as securing external financing which may include raising debt or equity capital. These plans are not entirely within the Company's control including our ability to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms, if at all.

to , although early pay discounts are offered to customers. The Company regularly experiences customer deductions from amounts invoiced due to product returns, product shortages, and delivery nonperformance penalty fees. This variable consideration is estimated using the expected value approach based on the Company s historical experience, and it is recognized as a reduction to the transaction price in the same period that the related product sale is recognized. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products to customers. Revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligations under the contract by transferring the promised product to its customer. The Company s contracts generally do not include any material significant financing components. Performance Obligations The Company has elected the following practical expedients provided for in ASC 606 : (1) The Company has excluded from its transaction price all sales and similar taxes collected from its customers. 

 (2) The Company has elected to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is or less. 

 (3) The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related good transfers as fulfillment activities instead of assessing such activities as performance obligations. 

 (4) The portfolio approach has been elected by the Company as it expects any effects would not be materially different in application at the portfolio level compared with the application at an individual contract level. 

 (5) The Company has elected not to disclose information about its remaining performance obligations for any contract that has an original expected duration of or less. 

 Neither the type of good sold nor the location of sale significantly impacts the nature, amount, timing, or uncertainty of revenue and cash flows.

During the first nine months of 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of in convertible notes that w ill automatically convert into equity securities at the earlier of maturity or the next sale (or series of related sales) by the Company of its equity securities from which the Company receives gross proceeds of not less than . See discussion of "Convertible Promissory Notes" in Note 6. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for purposes of per share calculations includes the Class V shares on as-exchanged basis. 
 of the applicable cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal and state income tax based on its ownership in Andina Holdings, LLC that the Company is deemed to realize in certain circumstances as a result of the increases in tax basis and certain tax attributes resulting from the Business Combination as described below. This is accounted for in conjunction with the methods used to record income tax described above. The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10 related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements. ASC 740-10 prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The benefit of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the Company income tax returns is recognized in the financial statements if such positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as unrecognized benefits . A liability is recognized (or amount of net operating loss carryover or amount of tax refundable is reduced) for an unrecognized tax benefit because it represents an enterprise s potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized as a result of applying the provisions of ASC 740-10. Interest costs and related penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are required to be calculated, if applicable. The Company's policy is to classify assessments, if any, for tax related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. As of September 30, 2024 , liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported. The Company does not expect any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits in the next year.

of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax that the Company actually realizes as a result of (a) tax basis adjustments resulting from taxable exchanges of Class B common units of Holdings and Class V common stock of the Company acquired by the Company in exchange for Class A common stock of the Company and (b) tax deductions in respect of portions of certain payments made under the TRA. All such payments to the Seller are the obligations of the Company. As of September 30, 2024 , there have been shares of Class B common units of Holdings and Class V common stock of the Company exchanged for an equal number of shares of Class A common stock of the Company. The Company has not recognized any change to the deferred tax asset for changes in tax basis, as the asset is not more-likely-than-not to be realized. Additionally, the Company has not recognized the TRA liability as it is not probable that the TRA payments would be paid based on the Company's historical loss position and would not be payable until the company realizes tax benefit.

A named executive officer of the Company granted the Lender a security interest in certain personal property owned by the named executive officer to further secure the Company's obligations under the PSA. The PSA provides for an initial twenty-four month term, followed by automatic annual renewal terms unless the subsidiaries provide written notice pursuant to the PSA prior to the end of any term.

of Stryve Foods, LLC which is treated as a disregarded entity for the U.S. federal income tax purposes. Stryve Foods Holdings, LLC's net taxable income and any related tax credits are passed through to its members and are included in the members tax returns, even though such net taxable income or tax credits may not have actually been distributed. The income tax burden on the earnings taxed to the non-controlling interests is not reported by the Company in its condensed consolidated financial statements under GAAP. As a result, the Company s effective tax rate is expected to differ materially from the statutory rate. ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported and amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position over the next twelve months. The Company currently estimates its annual effective income tax rate t o be , which differs from the federal rate of primarily due to tax benefit related to income passed through to non-controlling interest, increase in valuation allowances, and state and local income taxes. The Company has reported income tax expense of and for t he three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company has reported income tax expense of and for t he three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Tax Receivable Agreement Liability In conjunction with the Business Combination, the Company also entered into a TRA with the Seller and Holdings. Pursuant to the TRA, the Company is required to pay the Seller of the amount of savings, if any, in United States federal, state, local and foreign income tax that the Company actually realizes as a result of (a) tax basis adjustments resulting from taxable exchanges of Class B common units of Holdings and Class V common stock of the Company acquired by the Company in exchange for Class A common stock of the Company and (b) tax deductions in respect of portions of certain payments made under the TRA. All such payments to the Seller are the obligations of the Company. As of September 30, 2024 , there have been shares of Class B common units of Holdings and Class V common stock of the Company exchanged for an equal number of shares of Class A common stock of the Company. The estimation of liability under the TRA is by its nature imprecise and subject to significant assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future taxable income. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as the realizability of the tax benefit is not at the more likely than not threshold. Since the benefit has not been recorded, the Company has determined that the TRA liability is t probable and therefore no TRA liability existed as of September 30, 2024.

The Company determined that the sale and leaseback transaction contained continuing involvement and thus used the financing method consistent with ASC 842. The transfer did not qualify as a sale; hence it is considered a "failed" sale and both parties account for it as a financing transaction. Accordingly, a financing obligation related to the operating lease in the amount of the sale price has been booked and the corresponding assets on the balance sheet are maintained. Under the finance method, rental payments are applied as amortization and/or interest expense on the financing obligation as appropriate using an assumed interest rate. The Company is accounting for these as interest only payments because the Company's incremental cost to borrow when applied to the financing obligation is greater than the rental payments under the Lease Agreement.

 Overview 
 Stryve is an emerging healthy snacking company which manufactures, markets and sells highly differentiated healthy snacking products that Stryve believes can disrupt traditional snacking categories. Stryve s mission is to help Americans snack better and live happier, better lives. Stryve offers convenient snacks that are lower in sugar and carbohydrates and higher in protein than other snacks. Stryve offers all-natural, delicious snacks which it believes are nutritious and offer consumers a convenient healthy snacking option for their on-the-go lives. 
 Stryve s current product portfolio consists primarily of air-dried meat snack products marketed under the Stryve , Kalahari , Braaitime , and Vacadillos brand names. Unlike beef jerky, Stryve s all-natural air-dried meat snack products are made of beef and spices, are never cooked, most contain zero grams of sugar, and are free of monosodium glutamate (MSG), gluten, nitrates, nitrites, and preservatives. As a result, Stryve s products are Keto and Paleo diet friendly. Further, based on protein density and sugar content, Stryve believes that its air-dried meat snack products are some of the healthiest shelf-stable snacks available today. 
 Stryve distributes its products in major retail channels, primarily in North America, including mass, convenience, grocery, club stores, and other retail outlets, as well as directly to consumers through its e-commerce websites, as well as direct to consumer through the Amazon platform. 
 Stryve believes increased consumer focus in the U.S. on health and wellness will continue to drive growth of the healthy snacking category and increase demand for Stryve s products. Stryve has made substantial investments since its inception in product development, establishing its manufacturing facility, and building its marketing, sales and operations infrastructure to grow its business. As a result, Stryve has reported net losses since its inception. Stryve intends to continue to invest in productivity, product innovation, improving its supply chain, enhancing and expanding its manufacturing capabilities, and expanding its marketing and sales initiatives to drive continued growth.

Transformation Strategy 
 In May of 2022, Stryve announced a leadership change with Chris Boever stepping in as the new Chief Executive Officer of the Company. With this change in leadership, management thoughtfully reviewed the business, strategy, near-term prospects, and its path to profitability. From this, management began executing on a three-phase transformation plan to drive the Company towards a profitable, self-sustaining model. The first phase of the transition began in immediately and is focused on cost reduction, revenue rationalization, pricing, and organizational design. The second phase began later in 2022 and is focused on improvements in quality, talent, and maximizing value through productivity. Management believes the benefits of the efforts within each of these phases will be compounding as the changes and improvements are being built into the Company's ongoing operating model. 
 As part of the transformation, Management has identified certain one-time write-downs for assets that were non-core to the go-forward plan as well as identified necessary write-downs of inventory and incurring one-time employee costs related to actions taken to reorganize the business and its objectives in line with the strategic direction that Mr. Boever has for the enterprise. These charges began in the second quarter of 2022 and continued to a lesser extent throughout 2023. 
 In 2024, the final phase of the transformation is now underway. It is focused on accelerating quality growth through brand reinvigoration, enhanced sales strategies, disciplined promotional activity, and new partnerships to help expand the reach of our brands. We expect to continue to garner new retail distribution in both measured and non-measured channels and build upon the increases we've seen in our retail consumption metrics, ultimately increasing our market share within the category while seeking to maintain an optimized spending profile across the business. 
 
 New Packaging Retail Distribution Growth 
 A key piece of our retail growth strategy is tied to making the product more available and approachable. To accomplish this, we completed a strategic redesign of our packaging with retail conversion at the forefront of design considerations. We collaborated with both consumers and retailers as we sought to optimize the packaging for retail conversion. We received a positive response from many retail partners on the new designs, garnering additional distribution in the process. We began manufacturing select items in the new packaging in mid-2023 and transitioned the rest of our production over to the new packing throughout the balance of 2023 with final cut-over occurring around year-end. Our new packaging began to ship to retailers and distributors broadly beginning the first quarter of 2024, and by the end of the first nine months of 2024 we estimate that most of retailer shelves have transitioned to the new packaging. 
 We are encouraged by the consumer and retailer response to our updated packaging and are excited to share that as the new packaging has made its way through distribution and onto shelves for consumers that the impact on our retail consumption data has been very strong. While the positive impacts of the enhanced packaging and improved product quality have already been significant in terms of the consumer response at retail, we expect to see opportunities to grow our distribution footprint in measured channels in the coming quarters as a result of this performance which could lead to meaningful sales growth for the business. 
 
 Improving Quality of Revenue 
 As an extension of the restructuring plans, we evaluated our revenue base in the second half of 2022 and took steps to improve or eliminate low-quality revenue sources in order to create opportunities to drive long-term value-creating growth. Key considerations in these rationalization decisions included assessments of strategic alignment, complexity, and profitability. In assessing the profitability of a particular revenue stream specifically, we evaluated our revenues on a gross margin basis, a net margin basis, and a cash conversion basis. Accordingly, a meaningful portion of net sales in the first half of 2023 came from products, customers, and/or channels that have been rationalized. Further, this strategic rationalization, in some cases, required us to sell inventory through discount or liquidation channels during 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 which affected our gross margin. However, despite the impact on net sales that these rationalization efforts have had, our most valuable revenues have been supported by improved trends in the retail consumption of our products. 
 Additionally, we took actions to improve the quality of our revenue through improving our price-mix by working strategically with of some of our large retail partners to introduce new products that improved our unit economics while creating a more attractive consumer offering. 
 
 Optimizing Spend and Reducing Losses 
 Our third quarter of 2024 results are a product of the progress we have made on our cost mitigation strategies. We examined every area of spending throughout our business and identified ways to drive efficiencies, eliminate unnecessary expense, and focus on the highest and best use of each dollar. The resulting impact is a 15.9 year-over-year reduction in total operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, resulting in a 31.5 year-over-year improvement in our Adjusted EBITDA Loss (a non-GAAP financial measure) for the same period. See discussion of Adjusted EBITDA Loss in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section below. 
 While we intend to invest to drive meaningful growth in net sales, we plan to do so in a disciplined manner. By monitoring our unit economics closely, maintaining an optimized spending profile, and seeking to meaningfully grow net sales, we believe we will be able to drive further reductions in our net losses moving forward. 
 22 

We believe that we have entered the final phase of our planned transformation. The first two phases focused on reducing expenses while improving the quality of our revenues through rationalization and price actions to recover our unit economics paired with productivity in quality initiatives. The last phase is about accelerating quality growth and reaping the benefits of operating leverage through a redesigned cost structure. 
 
 Increased Consumption Driven Demand and Working Capital Constraints 
 The impact of our improved product quality and redesigned packaging has, so far, outperformed our expectations and those of our retail partners. In the second and third quarters of 2024, this growth in the consumption driven demand for our products has outpaced our ability to meet that increased demand such that we believe our shipments fell short of their potential in both quarters. This shortfall is not a function of capacity constraints or supply chain challenges but rather working capital to support the inventory build necessary to meet the run rate demand. Accordingly, we have been actively taking steps to bring more liquidity to the balance sheet to allow the Company to execute on that demand. 
 
 Promissory Notes 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we issued an aggregate of 3.4 million in principal amount of unsecured promissory notes (the Convertible Notes to select accredited investors to fund growth in working capital and general operations. The aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes is inclusive of 1.7 million from related parties. The Convertible Notes were issued with an original issue discount of 1 , accrue interest annually at a rate of 12 and will mature on December 31, 2024. The Convertible Notes will automatically convert into the securities issued in the next sale (or series of related sales) by the Company of its equity securities from which the Company receives gross proceeds of not less than 3.0 million. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company issued 0.8 million in principal amount of an unsecured promissory note (the Nonconvertible Note to a related party. The Nonconvertible Note was issued with an original issue discount of 1.5 , accrue interest annually at a rate of 15 and will mature at the earlier of the next sale (or series of related sales) by the Company of its equity securities, following the date of the Nonconvertible Note, from which the Company receives gross proceeds of not less than 5.0 million, or December 23, 2024. 
 
 Public Offering 
 On November 8, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement relating to the issuance and sale of 370,000 shares of the Company s Class A common stock and, in lieu of Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase 3,300,886 shares of Class A common stock, and accompanying warrants to purchase up to 7,341,772 shares of Class A common stock at a combined public offering price of 0.79 per share or pre-funded warrant (the Public Offering ). The Public Offering closed on November 12, 2024. The common warrants have an exercise price of 0.79 per share, are exercisable following stockholder approval and have a term of exercise equal to five years following date of the stockholder approval. The Company received gross proceeds from the Public Offering of approximately 2.9 million before deducting estimated offering expenses. In connection with the Public Offering, the Company also agreed to amend certain existing warrants originally issued on January 11, 2022, to purchase up to 529,412 shares of its Class A common stock at an exercise price of 54.00 per share to have a reduced exercise price equal to 0.79 per share, and the term extended to November 12, 2029, subject to stockholder approval. Additionally, the Company issued to placement agent warrants (the Placement Agent Warrants to purchase 367,088 shares of common stock. The Placement Agent Warrants are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of 0.869 and will expire on the third anniversary of the commencement of sales of the offering.

Net sales. Net sales increased by 1.5 million from 4.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, significant increases in our brands' sell-through velocities throughout our base distribution contributed to an increase in orders and shipments. If the increase in retail velocity that our brands are experiencing continues throughout 2024, we anticipate a net sales benefit due to increased replenishment orders. Additionally, these sustained improvements in our retail consumption data may also assist us in securing additional points of distribution which would serve to further drive net sales over time. However, our working capital constraints throughout 2024 have limited our ability to realize the full potential of this demand. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold decreased by 0.9 million from 3.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Productivity and yield improvements we have made to our cost of goods on a variable rate basis have partially offset some of the inflationary pressures on inputs, primarily beef. Overall commodity beef prices were higher in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the commodity costs that flowed through cost of goods sold in third quarter of the prior year. However, our productivity and yield enhancement strategies partially mitigated the impact these increased beef prices had during the quarter. We will continue to monitor beef and commodity pricing and should it remain elevated will consider executing on pricing actions in line with our continuous price action review process. 
 Gross Profit. Gross profit increased 0.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. As a percent of net sales, gross profit was 21.7 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a 13.3 in the third quarter of 2023. A few primary factors contribute to this performance: 
 Since the beginning of our transformation, we have taken steps to improve or eliminate low-quality revenue sources in order to drive long-term value-creating growth. While this has benefited margins by eliminating negative gross margin products or accounts, this has also resulted in lower plant utilization which can create a drag on gross margin. However, as our production ramped during the current year period, driven by the increased consumption we're seeing in the market, we have experience better absorption and expanded margins. 

24 

We took steps to improve the price per ounce in late 2023 for select retailers which benefited the third quarter of 2024. 

Commodity beef prices were higher throughout the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the cost of goods incurred the same period in 2023. However, we were able to improve our gross profit through our productivity, utilization, and yield maximization initiatives illustrating the positive impact of our transformation. 

Operating Expenses. 
 Selling expenses . Selling expenses decreased by 0.6 million from 1.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 driven by our efforts to reduce corporate overhead. 

Operations expense . Operations expenses increased by 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of increases in shipping volumes and some one-time expenses related to expanded distribution internationally. 

Salaries and wages . Salaries and wages decreased 0.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is mostly attributable to the transformation and productivity efforts of the Company. 

Depreciation and amortization expense . Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 0.2 million from 0.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.4 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 which stems primarily from the timing of capital expenditures. 

Operating Loss . Operating loss decreased by 1.4 million from 3.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and is primarily attributable to improved gross profit and decreased total operating expenses. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by 0.3 million from 1.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The current year period did not incur approximately 0.5 million of interest expense that was present in the prior year period related to the accounting treatment of the warrants issued in connection with the 2023 Notes. This year-over-year reduction in interest expense was offset by a 0.1 million increase related to the Invoice Purchase and Security Agreement (the "PSA") and a 0.1 million increase related to the 2024 Convertible Notes which were not in place in the prior year quarter. 
 Net Loss Before Income Taxes. Net loss before income taxes decreased 1.7 million from 4.8 million in three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, with the decrease primarily attributable to improved gross profit, restructuring efforts resulting in decreased operating expenses, and a decrease in interest expense.

Net sales. Net sales increased by 1.7 million from 14.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 16.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the first nine months of 2024, significant increases in our brands' sell-through velocities throughout our base distribution contributed to an increase in orders and shipments. If the increase in retail velocity that our brands are experiencing continues throughout 2024, we anticipate a net sales benefit due to increased replenishment orders. Additionally, these sustained improvements in our retail consumption data may also assist us in securing additional points of distribution which would serve to further drive net sales over time. However, our working capital constraints throughout 2024 have limited our ability to realize the full potential of this demand. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold increased by 0.2 million from 12.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 12.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Productivity and yield improvements we have made to our cost of goods on a variable rate basis have partially offset some of the inflationary pressures on inputs, primarily beef. Overall commodity beef prices were higher in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period while our productivity and yield enhancement strategies partially mitigated the impact these increased beef prices had during the quarter. We will continue to monitor beef and commodity pricing and should it remain elevated will consider executing on pricing actions in line with our continuous price action review process. 
 Gross Profit. Gross profit increased 1.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As a percent of net sales, gross profit was 23.9 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to a 17.3 in the first nine months of 2023. A few primary factors contribute to this performance: 
 Since the beginning of our transformation, we have taken steps to improve or eliminate low-quality revenue sources in order to drive long-term value-creating growth. While this has benefited margins by eliminating negative gross margin products or accounts, this has also resulted in lower plant utilization which can create a drag on gross margin.

26 

Commodity beef prices were higher throughout the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. However, even with these increased input costs in the first nine months of 2024, we were able to improve our gross profit through our productivity, utilization, and yield maximization initiatives illustrating the positive impact of our transformation. 

Operating Expenses. 
 Selling expenses . Selling expenses decreased by 1.1 million from 5.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 driven by our efforts to reduce corporate overhead. 

Operations expense . Operations expenses decreased by 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our strategic efforts to enable us to utilize more favorable modes of transportation and routes to market relative to the prior year period helped contribute to the reduction. 

Salaries and wages . Salaries and wages decreased 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, decreasing from 5.2 million to 4.6 million. This decrease is mostly attributable to the transformation and productivity efforts of the Company. 

Depreciation and amortization expense . Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 0.4 million from 1.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 1.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 which stems primarily from the timing of capital expenditures. 

Operating Loss . Operating loss decreased by 3.8 million from 11.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and is primarily attributable to decreased total operating expenses and improvement in gross profit. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by 0.4 million from 2.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The current year period did not incur approximately 0.9 million of interest expense that was present in the prior year period related to the accounting treatment of the warrants issued in connection with the 2023 Notes. This year-over-year reduction in interest expense was offset by a 0.2 million increase related to the Invoice Purchase and Security Agreement (the "PSA") and a 0.2 million increase related to the 2024 Convertible Notes which were not in place in the prior year quarter. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. We recorded a 0.3 million non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt related to the extension of the 2023 Notes and the associated repricing of the related Warrants in consideration of the extension for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net Loss Before Income Taxes. Net loss before income taxes decreased 3.7 million from 13.7 million in nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 10.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with the decrease primarily attributable to our restructuring efforts resulting in decreased operating expenses and improved gross profit offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We use non-GAAP financial measures and believe they are useful to investors as they provide additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in operating results, and provide additional insight on how the management team evaluates the business. Our management team uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Earnings per Share to make operating and strategic decisions, evaluate performance and comply with indebtedness related reporting requirements. Below are details on these non-GAAP measures and the non-GAAP adjustments that the management team makes in the definition of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Earnings per Share. We believe these non-GAAP measures should be considered along with Net Loss Before Income Taxes, Net Loss and Net Loss per Share, the most closely related GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings per Share, Net Loss Before Income Taxes, Net Loss and Net Loss per Share are below, and discussion regarding underlying GAAP results throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 EBITDA . Stryve defines EBITDA as Net Loss before Interest Expense, Income Tax Expense (Benefit), and Depreciation and Amortization Expense . 
 Adjusted EBITDA . Stryve defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted as necessary for certain items listed below in the table.

The Company allocated the proceeds from the April 2023 Financing transaction between the Notes and Warrants based on their relative fair values as of the closing date of the facility. The allocation resulted in the fair value of the warrants to be treated as a discount to the Notes of 1.4 million that was amortized through December 31, 2023. Accordingly, the Company recognized non-cash interest expense in connection with the discount of 0.5 million and 0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. In accordance with ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going concern (Subtopic 205-40) , we have evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 
 We have historically funded our operations with cash flow from operations, equity capital raises, and note payable agreements from shareholders and private investors, in addition to institutional loans. Our principal uses of cash have been debt service, capital expenditures, working capital, and funding operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred an operating loss of 7.5 million and used cash in operations of 5.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has approximately 16.3 million of indebtedness. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2022, we secured a term loan in the amount of 4.0 million. Additionally, we secured an asset based line of credit with a 8.0 million credit limit subject to accounts receivable and inventory balances. The term loan and asset based line of credit were secured in order to augment our liquidity, as needed, through the execution of management's transformation plan. The Company's initial draw on the term loan was 4.0 million taken in 2022, and as of September 30, 2024, 4.0 million (net of repayments) has been drawn on the asset based line of credit. The unused committed capacity under the asset based line of credit is approximately 4.0 million as of September 30, 2024, however, actual borrowing availability at any time is subject to advance rates on accounts receivable and inventory balances. No amount remained available to draw under the term loan as of September 30, 2024. During March 2024, the asset based line of credit was amended to extend the initial term twenty four (24) months after the date of the amendment, followed by automatic annual renewal terms unless the Company or the Lender provide written notice pursuant to the PSA prior to the end of any term. See Note 5 to our financial statements included herein for a description of the asset based line of credit and Note 6 for a description of the term loan. 
 
 On April 19, 2023, we issued an aggregate of 4.1 million in principal amount of secured promissory notes to select accredited investors carrying a 12 accrued interest rate to help support the working capital and growth needs of the business. The aggregate principal amount of the notes is inclusive of 1.2 million from related parties. We amended the terms in January 2024 to extend the maturity date from December 31, 2023 to the earlier of (i) December 31, 2024, or (ii) the closing of the next sale or series of related sales by the Company of its equity securities from which the Company receives gross proceeds of not less than 3.0 million. 
 
 In June 2023, we entered into an at-the-market equity offering sales agreement with Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, that established a program pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to 5.7 million of our Class A common stock from time to time in at-the-market transactions. The Company sold an aggregate of 960,639 shares under the at-the-market equity facility for gross proceeds of 2.4 million as of December 31, 2023. During March 2024, the Company terminated the at-the-market equity offering sales agreement. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we issued an aggregate of 3.4 million in principal amount of unsecured promissory notes (the Convertible Notes for proceeds of 3.4 million to select accredited investors to fund operations. The aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes is inclusive of 1.7 million from related parties. The Convertible Notes were issued with an original issue discount of 1 , accrue interest annually at a rate of 12 and will mature on December 31, 2024. Convertible Notes totalling 1.8 million will automatically convert into the securities issued in the next sale (or series of related sales) by the Company of its equity securities from which the Company receives gross proceeds of not less than 3.0 million. Certain of the Convertible Notes that remain unconverted at maturity will automatically convert into a new class of preferred shares. During 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 0.6 million in the automatically converted notes and amended 1.0 million of the original notes to automatically convert upon maturity. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company issued 0.8 million in principal amount of an unsecured promissory note (the Nonconvertible Note to a related party. The Nonconvertible Note was issued with an original issue discount of 1.5 , accrue interest annually at a rate of 15 and will mature at the earlier of the next sale (or series of related sales) by the Company of its equity securities, following the date of the Nonconvertible Note, from which the Company receives gross proceeds of not less than 5.0 million, or December 23, 2024. 
 
 On November 8, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement relating to the issuance and sale of 370,000 shares of the Company s Class A common stock and, in lieu of Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase 3,300,886 shares of Class A common stock, and accompanying warrants to purchase up to 7,341,772 shares of Class A common stock at a combined public offering price of 0.79 per share or pre-funded warrant (the Public Offering ). The Public Offering closed on November 12, 2024. The common warrants have an exercise price of 0.79 per share, are exercisable following stockholder approval and have a term of exercise equal to five years following date of the stockholder approval. The Company received gross proceeds from the Public Offering of approximately 2.9 million before deducting estimated offering expenses. In connection with the Public Offering, 
 29 

the Company also agreed to amend certain existing warrants originally issued on January 11, 2022, to purchase up to 529,412 shares of its Class A common stock at an exercise price of 54.00 per share to have a reduced exercise price equal to 0.79 per share, and the term extended to November 12, 2029, subject to stockholder approval. Additionally, the Company issued to placement agent warrants (the Placement Agent Warrants to purchase 367,088 shares of common stock. The Placement Agent Warrants are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of 0.869 and will expire on the third anniversary of the commencement of sales of the offering. 
 
 While these most recent financings will help provided us with liquidity to support our near-term goals and run rate demand, we are still evaluating several different strategies to enhance our liquidity position. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, pursuing additional actions under our business transformation plan, seeking additional financing from both the public and private markets through the issuance of equity securities and seeking to extend the terms of outstanding debt. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the capital we need to continue our operations on satisfactory terms or at all. We need additional funding to execute our business plan and continue operations. If capital is not available to us when, and in the amounts needed, we could be required to liquidate our inventory and assets, cease or curtail operations, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws or similar state proceedings. 
 
 For the balance of 2024, as we focus on accelerating quality growth, we will likely have to make additional investments in our working capital to support increased distribution with new and existing retailers coming online early next year. Many of these distribution resets have been secured in large part due to our new packaging design, improved product quality, and the resulting improvements in our retail consumption metrics. Accordingly, we will have to build net new inventories to support these upcoming resets. This investment in inventory ahead of sales has and may continue to put pressure on our liquidity position given the structure and terms of our credit facilities and has required us to seek external financing. While we anticipate the increased volumes will result in improved financial results and a significantly narrowed cash loss over time, we do anticipate continued growth which, depending on the rate of growth, may require more external financing. 
 
 We have prepared cash flow forecasts which indicate that based on our expected operating losses and cash consumption in order to fund inventory growth, we believe that absent an infusion of sufficient capital there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months after the date our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are issued. The Company's plan includes the items noted above as well as securing external financing which may include raising debt or equity capital. While we believe our plan, if successfully executed, will alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt, these plans are not entirely within the Company's control including our ability to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms, if at all. 
 
 Cash Flows. The following tables show summary cash flows information for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Net Cash used in Operating Activities . Net cash used in operating activities decreased 1.3 million from 6.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 5.1 million through the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in net losses of 3.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period which positively impact cash; offset by a negative impact to cash driven by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of 1.4 million, decrease in depreciation expense of 0.4 million and a decrease in amortization of debt discount related to the 2023 Notes of 0.9 million. 
 Net Cash used in Investing Activities . Net cash used in investing activities was minimal in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We believe our current manufacturing and fulfillment assets are generally sufficient to meet the near-term potential demand for our products and don't foresee the need for significant capital expenditures to facilitate growth in the coming quarters. 
 Net Cash provided by Financing Activities . Net cash provided by financing activities generated 1.2 million less in cash for the Company in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the comparable period a year ago due borrowings related to the PSA.

Certain Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 
 Stryve s management believes that the Company s future performance will depend on many factors, including the following: 
 
 Ability to Expand Distribution in both Online and Traditional Retail Channels. Stryve s products are sold through a growing number of traditional retail channels where the Company has an opportunity to acquire new consumers. Traditional retail channels include mass stores, grocery chains, natural food outlets, club stores, convenience stores, and drug stores, all either direct or through distribution partners. Stryve works closely with retailers to establish plans for distribution expansion and promotional opportunities. Stryve is also growing its consumer base through both paid and organic means both online as well. Online consumer acquisitions typically occur through the Company s portfolio of DTC e-commerce websites and Amazon.com. The Company s online consumer acquisition program includes paid and unpaid social media, search, and display media. 
 
 Ability to Acquire and Retain Consumers at a Reasonable Cost. Stryve s management believes an ability to consistently acquire and retain consumers at a reasonable cost relative to projected life-time value will be a key factor affecting future performance. To accomplish this goal, Stryve intends to strategically allocate advertising and promotional spend between online and offline channels, including shopper marketing and trade promotions in partnership with retail customers. Stryve's promotional activities will mostly be focused on increasing consumer awareness and driving trial of our products. Further, we acknowledge that changes to third-party algorithms or the ability to leverage retailer programs that may be utilized directly, or indirectly, by Stryve in its advertising efforts may impact the effectiveness of Stryve's advertising which may increase its overall cost to acquire and retain consumers. Further, management believes the performance of its packaging designs on shelf at retail will be key in driving trial with new consumers. 
 
 31 

Ability to Drive Repeat Usage of Our Products . Stryve accrues substantial economic value from repeat consumers who consistently purchase its products either online or in traditional retail. The pace of Stryve s growth rate will be affected by the repeat usage dynamics of existing and newly acquired customers. The Company utilizes a number of methods to drive repeat behavior including intelligent e-mail and text campaigns, targeted digital media, and subscribe and save incentives as well as in-store trade promotion strategies. 
 
 Ability to Expand Gross Margins . Stryve s overall profitability will be impacted by its ability to expand gross margins through effective sourcing of raw materials, managing production yields and drying times, controlling labor and shipping costs, as well as spreading other production-related costs over greater manufacturing volumes. Additionally, Stryve's ability to expand gross margins will be influenced by its revenue channel and customer mix as well as by Stryve's ability to pass price increases to its customers. 
 
 Ability to Expand Operating Margins . The Company s ability to expand operating margins will be impacted by its ability to effectively manage its fixed and variable operating expenses as net sales increase. 
 
 Ability to Manage Supply Chain and Expand Production In-line with Demand . Stryve s ability to grow and meet future demand will be affected by its ability to effectively plan for and source inventory from a variety of suppliers located inside and outside the United States. Additionally, efficiently scaling production capacity ahead of growth in net sales will be critical to the Company s ability to meet future demand without disruption. 
 
 Ability to Optimize Key Components of Working Capital . Stryve s ability to reduce cash burn in the near-term and eventually generate positive cash flow will be partially impacted by the Company s ability to effectively manage the key components of working capital which have a direct impact on the cash conversion cycle. Maintaining and securing sufficient liquidity to support ongoing investments in working capital required to facilitate growth will be key as Stryve seeks to optimize its components working capital and supply chain. 
 
 Seasonality. Because Stryve is so early in its lifecycle of growth, it is difficult to discern the exact magnitude of seasonality affecting its business. Any evidence of seasonality in the Company's revenue is not clearly discernible from the Company s historical growth. However, there does seem to be seasonal factors affecting its commodity inputs, primarily beef, that has developed since the pandemic. Understanding potential trends in seasonality will be key in Stryve s management of its expenses, liquidity, and working capital. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There have been no material changes in our Critical Accounting Estimates from the information provided in the Critical Accounting Estimates Section of Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Stryve s future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. 
 Concentration of credit risk . The balance sheet items that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and accounts receivable. The Company continuously evaluates the credit worthiness of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains cash balances in bank accounts that may, at times, exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC limits of 250,000 per institution. The Company incurred no losses from such accounts and management considers the risk of loss to be minimal. 
 32 

As of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, customer concentrations in excess of 10 consolidated sales and accounts receivable are below. No vendors represented more than 10 of purchases or accounts payable.

Interest rate risk . Stryve is subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowing based on a variable interest rate. Derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements, are not currently but may be used for the purpose of managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from Stryve s variable rate debt obligations that are expected to remain outstanding. Interest rate changes do not affect the market value of such debt, but could impact the amount of Stryve s interest payments, and accordingly, Stryve s future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. Additionally, changes in prevailing market interest rates may affect Stryve s ability to refinance existing debt or secure new debt financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, management acknowledges that both foreign and domestic central bank actions as well as geopolitical uncertainty and conflict, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East, may have unpredictable effects on the Company's exposure to interest rate risk either directly or indirectly. 
 Raw material risk. Stryve s profitability depends, among other things, on its ability to anticipate and react to raw material costs, primarily beef. The price of beef and other raw materials are subject to many factors beyond Stryve s control, including general economic conditions, inflation, processing labor shortages, cost of feed, demand, natural disasters, weather and other factors that may affect beef supply chain participants. Changes in the prices of beef and other raw materials have already negatively affected Stryve's results of operations, and any continued or further changes could have a material impact on Stryve s business, financial condition and results of operations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, management acknowledges that both foreign and domestic central bank actions as well as geopolitical uncertainty and conflict, such as Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East, may have unpredictable effects on the Company's exposure to risks in its procurement of raw material. 
 Inflation risk. Inflation may impact Stryve s revenue and cost of services and products, Stryve believes the effects of inflation on its business, financial condition and results of operations have been material to date which management hopes to alleviate through mitigating strategies. However, there can be no assurance that any mitigation strategies management employs will be effective or that its business, financial condition and results of operations will not be materially impacted by continued inflation in the future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, management acknowledges that both foreign and domestic central bank actions as well as geopolitical uncertainty and conflict, such as Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East, may have unpredictable effects on the Company's exposure to inflation risk either directly or indirectly.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 The Company's management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and Rule 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act, that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 34 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. Regardless of outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Our securities are currently listed on the Nasdaq. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 
 
 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; 

a determination that shares of our Class A common stock are penny stock which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares; 

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

On April 9, 2024, we received a deficiency letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq s Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) because our stockholders equity for the year ended December 31, 2023, as reported in our Form 10-K, was below the minimum stockholders equity requirement of 2,500,000 (the Stockholders Equity Requirement ). The notice had no immediate effect on our continued listing on Nasdaq, subject to our compliance with the other continued listing requirements. 
 
 We had until October 7, 2024 to meet the Stockholders Equity Requirement. As we did not regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity Requirement by October 7, 2024, we received a delisting determination letter on October 8, 2024 (the Delisting Determination Letter ). The Delisting Determination Letter stated that unless we requested a timely hearing before a Nasdaq Hearing Panel Panel to appeal Nasdaq s delisting determination, trading of our Class A common stock and warrants would be suspended and delisted from Nasdaq. 
 
 The Company has filed a request a hearing before the Panel, which was granted for November 26, 2024 (the Hearing Date ), at which it will request a suspension of delisting pending its return to compliance. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(a)(1)(B), the hearing request has stayed the suspension of trading and delisting of the Class A common stock and warrants pending the conclusion of the hearing process. Consequently, the Class A common stock and warrants will remain listed on Nasdaq at least until the Panel renders a decision following the hearing. 
 
 The Company intends, prior to the Hearing Date, to regain compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Rule by completing one or more equity offerings. 
 
 There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Rule or will otherwise be in compliance with other applicable Nasdaq listing rules, that the Company will be able to successfully complete an equity offering or that the Company s appeal of the delisting determination will be successful. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 None. 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None. 
 35 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 5. Other Information. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , there were no , or by any directors or officers to any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of securities of the Company that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading agreements.

 In connection with the Quarterly Report of Stryve Foods, Inc.
