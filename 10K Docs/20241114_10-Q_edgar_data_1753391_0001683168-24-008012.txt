Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern will require the Company
to obtain additional financing to fund its operations. In assessing the going concern, the board of directors has considered: 

- 
 The Company will obtain financial support from the related parties. 

- 
 Based on the business plans of the Company, management expects to see a positive trend in the Company s future results. 

The board of directors believes the Company has
adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of the release of these condensed

The full realization of the tax benefit associated
with the losses carried forward depends predominantly upon the Company s ability to generate taxable income during the carry-forward
period. 

In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income,
and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely
than not that these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits or that future deductibility is uncertain. 

The Company did t recognize deferred tax assets
for unused tax losses as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 as management of the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the
benefit from the loss carry forwards will not be realized.

Results of Operation 

Comparison for The Three Months Ended September

Revenue 

We generated 145,764 in revenue for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 625,954 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease in revenues
of 480,190 or 76.7 compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, 144,700 or 99.3 of our revenue
was derived from one single customer. Since the beginning of 2024, we experienced intensified competition, resulting in increased price
sensitivity among customers. Our competitors pricing strategies and promotional activities contributed to downward pressure on
product selling prices. Starting from the first quarter of 2024, we significantly reduced our selling prices to attract customers. However,
this price competition strategy was ineffective as there was an increased number of competitors entering the market and selling similar
products. We are redefining and adjusting our business strategy to gain a competitive advantage in the market. 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue was 105,123 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to 458,364 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenue mainly consists of the cost
of products sold and labor cost. The decrease in cost of revenue by 353,241 or 77.1 was mainly due to a decrease in the purchase price
of our main product, Chinese Twelve Zodiac Pendants , and decline in the volume of products sold, as reflected relatively
in line with the decrease in revenue. 

Gross profit 

Gross loss for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 40,641 compared with gross profit 167,590 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, our
gross margin slightly increased from 26.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 27.9 for the three months ended September
30, 2024, primarily because the reduction in cost of revenue was greater than the decrease in revenue. During the three months ended September
30, 2024, we purchased from one single supplier. Our supplier had significantly reduced the purchase price of the products that we sold
to our customers as they were also experiencing intensified competition among other suppliers. 

18 

Operating Expenses 

General and administrative expense 

By far the most significant component of our operating
expenses for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was general and administrative expenses in the amount of 87,558
and 138,035, respectively. The decrease of 50,477 or 36.6 was mainly due to a decrease in legal and professional fees. In the three
months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred legal and professional fees in connection with the execution and completion of the Contribution
transaction, because of which we ceased being a shell company. By contrast, we incurred only small legal and professional fees related
to our regular SEC reporting obligations in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net Loss 

We reported a net loss of 53,941 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net income of 23,031 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Although we operated
at a loss, we expect to see a positive trend in our future results. 

Comparison for The Nine Months Ended September
30, 2024 and 2023

Revenue 

We generated 302,899 in revenue for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,826,670 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease in revenues
of 1,523,771 or 83.4 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in product selling
prices as we adjusted our price downward to attract customers and the decrease in quantity sold by 86.8 from 5,608 pieces of ornament
and adornment products sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 888 pieces of ornament and adornment products sold during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We experienced intensified competition, resulting in increased price sensitivity among customers.
Our competitors pricing strategies and promotional activities contributed to downward pressure on product selling prices. 

19 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue was 222,642 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,506,068 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenue mainly consists of the cost
of products sold and labor cost. The decrease in cost of revenue by 1,283,426 or 85.2 was mainly due to a decrease in the purchase price
of our main product, Chinese Twelve Zodiac Pendants , and a decline in the volume of products sold, as reflected relatively
in line with the decrease in revenue. 

Gross profit 

Gross profit for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 was 80,257 compared with 320,602 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, our gross margin
increased from 17.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 26.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily because
the decrease in the cost of revenue was greater than the reduction in revenue. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased
from one single supplier. Our supplier had significantly reduced the purchase price of the products that we sold to our customers as they
were also experiencing intensified competition among other suppliers. 

Operating Expenses 

General and administrative expense 

By far the most significant component of our operating
expenses for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was general and administrative expenses in the amount of 314,651
and 526,075, respectively. The decrease of 211,424 or 40.2 was mainly due to a decrease in legal and professional fees. In the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred legal and professional fees in connection with the execution and completion of the Contribution
transaction, because of which we ceased being a shell company. By contrast, we incurred only small legal and professional fees related
to our regular SEC reporting obligations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net Loss 

We reported a net loss of 254,896 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 225,530 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Although we operated
at a loss, we expect to see a positive trend in our future results.

Our principal sources of liquidity and capital
resources have been, and are expected to continue to be, cash flow from operations and cash advances from related parties. Our principal
uses of cash have been, and we expect will continue to be, for working capital to support a reasonable increase in our scale of operations. 

20 

Management has estimated our cash flow from future
operations and available support from related parties and has concluded that we have, or will have access to, sufficient financial resources
to meet our financial obligations as and when they fall due in the coming twelve months. There can be no assurances, however, that any
of the financial resources we may be contemplating as being available to us in the future will, in fact, be available to us on acceptable
terms, if at all. We believe there will be sufficient funds to run our operations for the next 12 months. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash
equivalents of 189,842. The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flows for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023:

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was (443,053)
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The difference between our net loss of (254,896) and net cash outflows from operating activities
was due to the adjustment of non-cash depreciation of a motor vehicle in the amount of 20,057 and the cash used in operating assets and
liabilities in an aggregate amount of (208,214). 

The cash used in operating assets and liabilities
was mainly attributable to a decrease in advance from customers of (140,862) due to fewer unfulfilled sales orders. 

Investing Activities 

No cash movement on investing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash generated from financing activities was
 221,592 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was attributable to the funds from related parties to support our business
operations. 

Inflation 

Inflation and changing prices have not had a material
effect on our business, and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable
future. However, our management will closely monitor price changes in our industry and continually maintain effective cost control in
operations. 

21 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to an investor in our securities. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company s revenue recognition policy
is compliant with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised
goods and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods.
In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts
with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for
those goods. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: 

(i) 
 
 identification of the goods and services in the contract; 
 
 (ii) 
 
 determination of whether the goods and services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; 
 
 (iii) 
 
 measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; 
 
 (iv) 
 
 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 
 
 (v) 
 
 recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. 

The Company only applies the five-step model to
contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services
it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews
the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct.
The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when
the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, the Company s performance obligations are transferred
to customers at a point in time, typically upon delivery or service being rendered. 

Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue
related to advance received from customers for future transfer of goods to customers. The balance of deferred revenue represents unfulfilled
performance obligations in the sales agreement, i.e products that have not yet been delivered. Once the related products have been delivered,
the amount in deferred revenue account is shifted to a revenue account. 

For all reporting periods, the Company has not
disclosed the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for all product revenue contracts with an original expected length of one year
or less, which is an optional exemption that is permitted under the adopted rules. 

Recent accounting pronouncements 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial
Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . This standard requires
a financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present
the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The Company has adopted this standard on January
1, 2023 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10,
 Government Assistance (Topic 832) which enhances disclosure of transactions with governments that are accounted for
by applying a grant or contribution model. The new pronouncement requires entities to provide information about the nature of the transaction,
terms and conditions associated with the transaction and financial statement line items affected by the transaction. The Company adopted this
standard on January 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

22 

On December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness
of income tax disclosures. The amendments require that public business entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in
the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect
of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pre-tax income or loss by the applicable
statutory income tax rate). In addition, public business entities are required to provide certain qualitative disclosures about the rate
reconciliation and the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated (1) by federal (national), state, and foreign
taxes and (2) by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of
total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). For public business entities, the standard is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2024. The amendments in this ASU require a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings
(or other appropriate components of equity or net assets) as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts
the amendments. The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

The Company has considered all other recently
issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its condensed
consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) under the Exchange Act)
that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an
issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b)
under the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation with the participation of the Company s management, including the
Company s chief executive officer CEO and the Company s chief financial officer CFO ), of the
effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of
September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the Company s limited internal resources and lack of ability to
have multiple levels of transaction review. 

Management is in the
process of determining how best to change our current system and implement a more effective system to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act have been recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately.
Our management intends to develop procedures to address the current deficiencies to the extent possible given limitations in financial
and manpower resources. While management is working on a plan, no assurance can be made at this point that the implementation of such
controls and procedures will be completed in a timely manner or that they will be adequate once implemented. 

Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Except for the matters
described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

23

adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.
