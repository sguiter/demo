Package ).

of the Company s operating subsidiary, Silver Valley, until a full security package was put in place concurrent with the consummation
of the CD1. In the event of non-conversion, the principal of the RCD will be repayable in cash.

The
Stream 

was advanced to the Company. The Stream is secured
by the same security package that is in place with respect to the RCD, CD1, and CD2. The Stream is repayable by applying 10 of all payable
metals sold until a minimum quantity of metal is delivered consisting of, individually, 63.5 million pounds of zinc, 40.4 million pounds
of lead, and 1.2 million ounces of silver (subsequently amended, as described below). Thereafter, the Stream would be repayable by applying
2 of payable metals sold. The delivery price of streamed metals will be 20 of the applicable spot price. At the Company s option,
the Company may buy back 50 of the Stream Amount at a 1.40x multiple of the Stream Amount between the second and third anniversary of
the date of funding, and at a 1.65x multiple of the Stream Amount between the third and fourth anniversary of the date of funding. The
Company incurred of transactions costs directly related to the Stream which were capitalized against the initial recognition
of the Stream. 

The
Company determined that in accordance with ASC 815 derivatives and hedging, the Stream does not meet the criteria for treatment as a
derivate instrument as the quantities of metal to be sold thereunder are not subject to a minimum quantity, and therefore a notional
amount is not determinable. The Company has therefore determined that in accordance with ASC 470, the stream obligation should be treated
as a liability based on the indexed debt rules thereunder. The initial recognition has been made at fair value based on cash received,
net of transaction costs, and the discount rate calibrated so that the future cash flows associated with the Stream, using forward commodity
prices, equal the cash received. The measurement of the stream obligation is accounted for at amortized cost with accretion at the discount
rate. Subsequent changes to the expected cash flows associated with the Stream will result in the adjustment of the carrying value of
the stream obligation using the same discount rate, with changes to the carrying value recognized in the condensed interim consolidated
statements of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income. 

The
Company determined the effective interest rate of the Stream obligation to be

for the first nine months of 2024 was compared to for the first nine months of 2023. The effective tax rate during the first
nine months of 2024 rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets available to offset
the deferred tax liability associated with the Stream Obligation. The Company maintains a valuation allowance against net operating losses

realized. The Company analyzes its deferred tax assets and, if it is determined that the Company will not realize all or a portion of

ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion
of the related valuation allowance will be reduced.

Description
of Business 

Corporate
Information 

The
Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S.A on February 20, 2007, under the name Lincoln Mining Corp. On February
11, 2010, the Company changed its name to Liberty Silver Corp and subsequently, on September 29, 2017, the Company changed its name to
Bunker Hill Mining Corp. The Company s registered office is located at 1802 N. Carson Street, Suite 212, Carson City Nevada 89701,
and its head office is located at 300-1055 West Hastings Street Vancouver, British Columbia, V6E 2E9, and its telephone number is 604.417.7952.
The Company s website is www.bunkerhillmining.com. Information appearing on the website is not incorporated by reference into this
report. 

Overview and Outlook 

Our primary focus is the development and restart of our 100 owned Bunker Hill Mine (the Bunker
Hill Mine in Kellogg, Idaho, USA. The Mine is the largest single producing mine by tonnage in
the Silver Valley region of northwest Idaho, producing over 165 million ounces of silver and 5 million tons of base metals between 1885
and 1981. The Bunker Hill Mine is located within Operable Unit 2 of the Bunker Hill Superfund site (EPA National Priorities Listing IDD048340921),
where cleanup activities have been completed. 

The
Company was incorporated for the initial purpose of mineral exploration at the Bunker Hill Mine. The Company has moved into the
development stage concurrent with (i) purchasing the mine and a process plant, (ii) completing successive technical and economic
studies, including a Prefeasibility Study, (iii) delineating mineral reserves, and (iv) advancing the construction of the facilities for a planned commencement of operations during the first half
of 2025. 

In May 2024, we initiated a mineral resource expansion
and exploration diamond drilling program in support of the staged restart plan. The program includes 8,975 feet of core to be drilled
from underground to further define and expand a portion of the existing resource that is in close proximity to where the initial mining
will occur. 

Current
External Factors Impacting our Business 

In
2022, the United States Geological Survey included zinc as a critical material as it is essential to the U.S. economy and national security,
and because the domestic supply chain is vulnerable to disruption due to China s supply dominance. Zinc
uses range from metal products to rubber and medicines. About three-fourths of zinc used is consumed as metal, mainly as a coating to
protect iron and steel from corrosion (galvanized metal), as alloying metal to make bronze and brass, as zinc-based die casting alloy,
and as rolled zinc. 

Due
to the dominance of China over certain critical materials production, including zinc, the U.S. federal government is taking certain actions
to support the domestic critical materials supply chain, including tax incentives and federal loan programs specifically designed to
support critical materials producers, and to strengthen the defense industrial base with respect to critical minerals including zinc.
During the first nine months of 2024, we have monitored the general U.S. political climate and actions taken by the U.S. government to
secure domestic critical materials, including zinc, which is one of the materials in our Bunker Hill Mine deposit, along with silver
and lead. 

In
addition, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and other external influences (such as the Russia/Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle
East, including the Israel war) have further focused the U.S. government on the importance of implementing secure domestic supply chains,
including for critical and base metal materials. The Company monitors and participates in these initiatives as they are critical to the
production of domestic defense and other technologies. 

Results
of Operations 

The
following discussion and analysis provides information that is believed to be relevant to an assessment and understanding of the results
of operation and financial condition of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. 

Comparison
of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenue 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, we generated no revenue. 

Expenses 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we reported total operating expenses of 3,434,359 and 2,771,722,
respectively. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions and head count
associated with construction of the process plant commencing in the quarter. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we reported total operating expenses of 11,372,104 and 8,294,183,
respectively. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions and head count
associated with construction of the process plant commencing in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Net
loss and Comprehensive loss 

We
experienced a net loss of 8,078,972 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (compared to net income of 7,447,860 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023). In addition to the increase in operating expenses (as described above), net loss for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, was impacted by an increase in financing costs of 759,913 and a loss on revaluation of the Silver Loan of
 2,109,601 compared to nil and nil respectively for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss in the 2024 quarter compared
to net income for the 2023 quarter was due to a loss in derivative liability of 7,522,530 (gain of 1,009,100 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 compared to a gain of 8,531,630 for the three months ended September 30, 2023), which was driven by a proportionally
smaller appreciation in the Company s
share price in the third quarter of 2024 relative to the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, a loss on fair value of the convertible
debentures of 144,193 was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gain of 2,450,968 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. This 2024 loss on the fair value of the convertible debentures was partially offset by a gain resulting from
the modification of the convertible debenture of 1,308,062 compared to nil for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively.
The three month period ended September 30, 2024 included a 1,793,800 loss nil for the three months ended September 30, 2023) on the
revaluation of the stream debenture due to updated key assumptions such as commodity prices. During the three months ended September
30, 2024, the Company incurred a loss of 924,820 from the sale of equipment nil for the three months ended September 30, 2023). Net
loss for the three months ending September 30, 2024 included a deferred tax recovery of 448,844 compared to deferred tax recovery of
 903,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

We experienced a net loss of 17,563,412 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 (compared to a net loss of 7,618,775 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023). In addition to the
increase in operating expenses (as described above), net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by an increase
in interest expense of 1,105,721 6,112,413 and 5,006,692 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively), and
 nil of gain on debt settlement for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7,117,420 of gain on debt settlement relating
to the conversion of the royalty convertible debenture into a royalty during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. A loss on fair
value of the convertible debenture of 799,688 was recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gain of 2,256,437
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the nine months ended September 30, 2024, includes 2,109,601 nil for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023) loss on revaluation of the Silver Loan due to updated key assumptions such as commodity prices.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a loss of 924,820 from the sale of equipment nil for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023). This was partially offset by a gain on in derivative liabilities of 393,755 in the 2024 period compared
to a loss of 488,357 in the 2023 period (driven by the Company s share price increasing during the first nine months of 2024 compared
to a decrease in the first nine months of 2023) and a gain on debt modification of 1,308,062 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 compared to a loss on debt modification of 99,569 for the nine months ended September 2023. Net loss for the nine months ending
September 30, 2024, included a deferred tax recovery of 1,653,562 compared to deferred tax expense of 2,605,741 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

We had a comprehensive loss of 11,395,198 and 20,115,504 for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to comprehensive income (loss) of 7,516,598 and (7,116,440) for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Comprehensive (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024, is inclusive of a (3,316,226) and (2,552,092) loss on change in fair value on own credit risk compared to income of 68,738 and
 502,335 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Current
Assets and Total Assets 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had total current assets were 12,644,351, compared to total current assets of 27,176,997 at December
31, 2023 a decrease of 14,532,646; and total assets of 81,734,573, compared to total assets of 61,989,678 at December 31,
2023 a increase of 19,744,895. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our current assets decreased
due to cash expenditures on the process plant, purchasing of equipment and additions to the Bunker Hill Mine. Total assets increased
slightly as the increase in property plant and equipment was offset largely by the decrease in cash. 

29 

Current
Liabilities and Total Liabilities 

As
of September 30, 2024, our total current liabilities of 23,484,810 and total liabilities of 125,714,546, compared to total current
liabilities of 7,472,326 and total liabilities of 88,356,840 at December 31, 2023. Total liabilities increased because of the
issuance of the silver loan, accretion on the stream debenture and the environmental protection agency payable as well as an
increase in accounts payable and accruals due to timing of invoices and payments. 

Working
Capital and Shareholders Deficit 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 10,840,459 and a shareholders deficiency of 43,979,973
compared to a working capital of 19,704,671 and a shareholders deficiency of 26,367,162 as of December 31, 2023. The
working capital balance decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to cash expenditures on the process
plant, purchasing of equipment, and additions to the Bunker Hill Mine. The shareholders deficiency increased primarily due to
the net loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

In
order to meet our funding needs, as discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements, we are in the process of securing a US dollar
loan amount equal to up to 1.2 million ounces of silver, to be advanced in one or more tranches. On August 8, 2024, we closed the
first tranche of the Silver Loan in the principal amount of 16,422,039, being the number of US dollars equal to 609,805 ounces of
silver. After deduction of financing costs and the first-year interest we received 13,225,005. On September 25, 2024, we closed the
second tranche Silver Loan in the principal amount of 6,369,000, being the number of US dollars equal to 200,000 ounces of silver.
After deduction of financing costs and the first-year interest we received 5,352,438. On November 6, 2024, we closed the third tranche of the Silver Loan in
the principal amount of 6,321,112, being the number of US dollars equal to 198,777 ounces of silver. After deduction of financing costs
and the first-year interest the Company received 5,422,474. Subsequent tranches under the Silver Loan are
expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. As also discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements, we have a
 21,000,000 debt facility with Sprott which is available at our election for a period of 2 years, ending on June 23, 2027. As of
September 30, 2024, we have not drawn on this facility. 

We also plan to secure additional financial resources through potential
equity financings and other strategic initiatives, including our EXIM direct loan application. Ultimately, if the Company is unable to
secure sufficient additional financial resources, the Company may need to curtail or suspend its development or operations plans regarding
the Bunker Hill Mine or other initiatives. 

Cash
Flow 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net cash decrease of 14,722,155, primarily due to cash expenditures on the
process plant, purchasing of equipment, and additions to the Bunker Hill Mine offset by 18,108,114 of cash provided by financing activities
relating to the issuance of the Silver Loan.

On October 28, 2024 the Company received a
non-binding Letter of Interest from EXIM for a debt funding package of up to 150M with a loan term of up to 15 years. The funding,
if and when secured following a full application process, would enable the Company to expedite the development of the 2500tpd Bunker
2.0 expansion project coincident with restarting the mine and strengthening the balance sheet. 

Silver Loan 

On November 6, 2024, the Company closed the third
tranche of the Silver Loan in the principal amount of 6,321,112, being the number of US dollars equal to 198,777 ounces of silver. After
deduction of financing costs and the first-year interest the Company received 5,422,474. 

Critical
accounting estimates 

The
preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and judgments are continuously evaluated and are based on management s
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
outcomes can differ from these estimates. The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material
adjustment to the amounts recognized in the financial statements are: 

Share-based
payments 

Management
determines costs for share-based payments using market-based valuation techniques. The fair value of the share awards and warrant liabilities
are determined at the date of grant using generally accepted valuation techniques and for warrant liabilities at each balance sheets
date thereafter. Assumptions are made and judgment used in applying valuation techniques. These assumptions and judgments include estimating
the future volatility of the stock price and expected dividend yield. Such judgments and assumptions are inherently uncertain. Changes
in these assumptions affect the fair value estimates. 

30 

Convertible
Loans, Promissory Notes, Stream Obligation and Warrants 

Estimating
the fair value of derivative warrant liability requires determining the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms
and conditions of the issuance. This estimate also requires determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including
the expected life of the warrants derivative liability, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. 

The
fair value estimates of the convertible loans use inputs to the valuation model that include risk-free rates, equity value per share
of common stock, USD-CAD exchange rates, spot and futures prices of minerals, expected equity volatility, expected volatility in minerals
prices, discount for lack of marketability, credit spread, expected mineral production over the life of the Bunker Hill Mine, and project risk/estimation
risk factors. 

The
stream obligation inputs used to determine the future cash flows and effective interest for the amortized cost calculation include futures
prices of minerals and expected mineral production over the life of the Bunker Hill Mine. 

The
fair value estimates may differ from actual fair values and these differences may be significant and could have a material impact on
the Company s balance sheets and the consolidated statements of operations. Assets are reviewed for an indication of impairment
at each reporting date. This determination requires significant judgment. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include, but
are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, interruptions in exploration activities or a significant drop in
precious metal prices. 

Accrued
liabilities 

The
Company has to make estimates to accrue for certain expenditures due to delay in receipt of third-party vendor invoices. These accruals
are made based on trends, history and knowledge of activities. Actual results may be different. 

The
Company makes monthly estimates of its water treatment costs, with a true-up to the annual invoice received from IDEQ. Using the actual
costs in the annual invoice, the Company will then reassess its estimate for future periods. Given the nature, complexity and variability
of the various actual cost items included in the invoice, the Company has used the most recent invoice as its estimate of the water treatment
costs for future periods. 

Incremental
Borrowing rate 

The
Company estimates the incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of future lease payments. Actual results may be different
from estimates. 

Borrowing
Cost Capitalization rate 

The
Company makes estimates to determine the percentage of borrowing costs that are capitalized into property plant and equipment. Actual
results may be different. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC defines the term disclosure controls and procedures to mean a company s
controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that
it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required to disclose
in the reports it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under
the SEC s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to principal executive
and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company made an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting for the timely alert to material information required to be included in the
Company s periodic SEC reports and of ensuring that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified. This evaluation resulted in the conclusion that the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

31 

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

The
management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and related financial information appearing
in this report. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The management of the Company also is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A company s internal control over
financial reporting is defined as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i) pertain to the maintenance of records that
in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company; and iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Management,
including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls, procedures and internal control over financial
reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Further, over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

With
the participation of the CEO and CFO, the Company s management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed
or submitted by the Company under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed
or submitted by the Company under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s
principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO have concluded that the internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024.

1. Legal Proceedings 

Other
than as described below, neither the Company nor its property is the subject of any current, pending, or threatened legal proceedings.
The Company is not aware of any other legal proceedings in which any director, officer or affiliate of the Company, any owner of record
or beneficially of more than 5 of any class of the Company s voting securities, or any associate of any such director, officer,
affiliate or security holder of the Company, is a party adverse to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or has a material interest
adverse to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 

On
July 28, 2021, a lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the District of Idaho brought by Crescent Mining, LLC Crescent ).
The named defendants include Placer Mining, Robert Hopper Jr., and the Company. The lawsuit alleges that Placer Mining and Robert Hopper
Jr. intentionally flooded the Crescent Mine during the period from 1991 and 1994, and that the Company is jointly and severally liable
with the other defendants for unspecified past and future costs associated with the presence of AMD in the Crescent Mine. The plaintiff
has requested unspecified damages. On September 20, 2021, the Company filed a motion to dismiss Crescent s claims against it, contending
that such claims are facially deficient. On March 2, 2022, Chief US District Court Judge, David C. Nye granted in part and denied
in part the Company s motion to dismiss. The court granted the Company s motion to dismiss Crescent s Cost Recovery
claim under CERCLA Section 107(a), Declaratory Judgment, Tortious Interference, Trespass, Nuisance and Negligence claims. These claims
were dismissed without prejudice. The court denied the motion to dismiss filed by Placer Mining Corp. for Crescent s trespass,
nuisance and negligence claims. Crescent later filed an amended complaint on April 1, 2022. Placer Mining Corp. and Bunker Hill Mining
Corp are named as co-defendants. Bunker Hill responded to the amended filing, refuting and denying all allegations made in the complaint
except those that are assertions of fact as a matter of public record. The Company believes Crescent s lawsuit is without merit
and is vigorously defending itself, as well as Placer Mining Corp. pursuant to the Company s indemnification of Placer Mining Corp
in the Sale and Purchase agreement executed between the companies for the Bunker Hill Mine on December 15, 2021. 

On
October 26, 2021, the Company asserted claims against Crescent in a separate lawsuit, which has been consolidated into the Crescent lawsuit.
The Company commenced Bunker Hill Mining Corporation v. Venzee Technologies Inc. et al, Case No. 2:21-cv-209-REP, in the US District
Court for the District of Idaho on May 14, 2021. The Company has subsequently executed a tolling agreement with Venzee in exchange for
dropping its claims against Venzee. The Company originally filed this lawsuit on May 14, 2021 against other parties but has since filed
an amended complaint to include its claims against Crescent. The Court consolidated the two lawsuits on April 19, 2022. The consolidated
lawsuits are currently in the discovery phase, in which information is gathered and exchanged.
