 The preliminary purchase price allocation includes of acquired identifiable intangible assets, all of which have finite lives. The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets has been estimated by using the income approach through a discounted cash flow analysis of certain cash flow projections. The cash flow projections are based on forecasts used by the Company to price the Webhelp Combination, and the discount rates applied were benchmarked by referencing the implied rate of return of the Company s pricing model and the weighted average cost of capital. The intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives on either a straight-line basis or an accelerated method that reflects the economic benefit of the asset. The determination of the useful lives is based upon various industry studies, historical acquisition experience, economic factors, and future forecasted cash flows of the Company following the acquisition of Webhelp.

 The supplemental pro forma financial information reflects pro forma adjustments to present the combined pro forma results of operations as if the combination with Webhelp had occurred on December 1, 2022 to give effect to certain events that the Company believes to be directly attributable to the acquisition. These pro forma adjustments primarily include: 
 
 A net increase in amortization expense that would have been recognized due to acquired identifiable intangible assets. 
 An increase in depreciation expense associated with the step up of fair values of property and equipment assets acquired. 
 A net increase to interest expense to reflect the additional borrowings of Concentrix incurred in connection with the combination as previously described and the repayment of Webhelp s historical debt in conjunction with the combination.

In addition to aligning the currency of a portion of the Company s interest payments to the Company s euro-denominated cash flows, the arrangements, together with intercompany loans and additional intercompany cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements described below, effectively converted aggregate principal amount of the Company s Senior Notes due 2026 and aggregate principal amount of the Company s Senior Notes due 2028 into synthetic fixed euro-based debt at weighted average interest rates of and , respectively. 
 
 Concurrent with entering into the cross-currency interest rate swaps with certain financial institutions, Marnix SAS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Concentrix, entered into corresponding U.S. dollar denominated intercompany loan agreements with certain other subsidiaries of Concentrix with identical terms and notional amounts as the underlying U.S. dollar denominated senior notes, with reciprocal cross-currency interest rate swaps.

 Offsetting of Derivatives 
 In the consolidated balance sheets, the Company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements. 
 Credit exposure for derivative financial instruments is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the contracts exceed the Company s obligations to the counterparties. The Company manages the potential risk of credit losses by selecting counterparties from a limited group of financial institutions with high credit standing.

 Fair value 
 Carrying amount 
 
 The Company s cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments in money market funds and term deposits with maturity periods of three months or less. The carrying values of cash equivalents approximate fair value since they are near their maturity. Investment in foreign government bond classified as an available-for-sale debt security is recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices. The fair values of forward exchange contracts are measured based on the foreign currency spot and forward rates. Fair values of long-term foreign currency exchange contracts are measured using valuations based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and are valued by reference to similar financial instruments, adjusted for terms specific to the contracts. The fair values of the cross-currency interest rate swaps are determined using a market approach that is based on observable inputs other than quoted market prices, including contract terms, interest rates, currency rates, and other market factors. The estimated fair value of the acquisition contingent consideration entered into in connection with the Webhelp Combination was determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The inputs include the closing price of Concentrix common stock as of the reporting period end date, Concentrix-specific historical equity volatility, and the risk-free rate. 
 The effect of nonperformance risk on the fair value of derivative instruments was not material as of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023.

The Indenture contains customary covenants and restrictions, including covenants that limit Concentrix Corporation s and certain of its subsidiaries ability to create or incur liens on shares of stock of certain subsidiaries or on principal properties, engage in sale/leaseback transactions or, with respect to

. The Restated Credit Facility also provides for a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed approximately (the Term Loan ), of which was incurred upon the amendment and approximately was drawn on a delayed draw basis on the Closing Date. Aggregate borrowing capacity under the Restated Credit Facility may be increased by up to an additional by increasing the amount of the revolving credit facility or by incurring additional term loans, in each case subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Restated Credit Facility, including the receipt of additional commitments for such increase. 
 As of November 30, 2023, the outstanding principal balance on the Term Loan was due to principal payments made subsequent to the Closing Date. During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, the Company voluntarily prepaid and , respectively, of the principal balance on the Term Loan, without penalty, resulting in an outstanding balance at August 31, 2024 of . 
 The maturity date of the Restated Credit Facility is December 27, 2026, subject, in the case of the revolving credit facility, to two one-year extensions upon the Company s prior notice to the lenders and the agreement of the lenders to extend such maturity date. Due to the voluntary prepayments previously described, no principal payment is required until the outstanding principal amount is due in full on the maturity date.

In addition, the Restated Credit Facility contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter, (i) a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Restated Credit Facility) not to exceed to 1.0 (or for certain periods following certain qualified acquisitions, including the Webhelp Combination, to 1.0) and (ii) a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Restated Credit Facility) equal to or greater than to 1.0.

 Securitization Facility 
 On April 25, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Securitization Facility to (i) increase the commitment of the lenders to provide available borrowings from up to to up to , (ii) extend the termination date of the Securitization Facility from July 5, 2024 to April 24, 2026, and (iii) amend the interest rate margins, such that borrowings under the Securitization Facility that are funded by certain lenders through such lenders issuance of commercial paper bear interest at the applicable commercial paper rate plus a spread of and, otherwise, at a bank rate that includes a per annum rate equal to the applicable SOFR rate (subject to a SOFR related adjustment of ), plus a spread of . 
 Under the Securitization Facility, Concentrix Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (the Originators sell or otherwise transfer all of their accounts receivable to a special purpose bankruptcy-remote subsidiary of the Company (the Borrower that grants a security interest in the receivables to the lenders in exchange for available borrowings of up to . The amount received under the Securitization Facility is recorded as debt on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Borrowing availability under the Securitization Facility may be limited by the Company s accounts receivable balances, changes in the credit ratings of the clients comprising the receivables, client concentration levels in the receivables, and certain characteristics of the accounts receivable being transferred (including factors tracking performance of the accounts receivable over time). 
 The Securitization Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant that is consistent with the Restated Credit Facility and customary events of default, including payment defaults, defaults under certain other indebtedness, a change in control of Concentrix Corporation, and certain events negatively affecting the overall credit quality of the transferred accounts receivable. 
 The Borrower s sole business consists of the purchase or acceptance through capital contributions of the receivables and related security from the Originators and the subsequent retransfer of or granting of a security interest in such receivables and related security to the administrative agent under the Securitization Facility for the benefit of the lenders. The Borrower is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled, upon its liquidation, to be satisfied out of the Borrower s assets prior to any assets or value in the Borrower becoming available to the Borrower s equity holders, and the assets of the Borrower are not available to pay creditors of the Company and its subsidiaries.

As a result, the Company discounted the Sellers Note by using an approximate imputed annual interest rate. This discounting resulted in an initial value of or .

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 29, 2024. References to we, our, us, or the Company or Concentrix refer to Concentrix Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Certain comparisons of the year-over-year changes in revenue and cost of revenue in the discussion of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 include a supplemental comparison as if the Webhelp Combination had occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2023. These supplemental comparisons can be identified by the language if the Webhelp Combination had occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2023 . The amounts used in these supplemental comparisons were determined by adding (a) the Webhelp results of operations for the relevant period in fiscal year 2023 prior to the Webhelp Combination and making reclassification and adjustments of International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IFRS to U.S. GAAP for the periods, consistent with the adjustments made in our unaudited proforma condensed combined financial statements filed as Exhibit 99.2 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024 and (b) the Company s consolidated results of operations for the relevant period in fiscal year 2023. We believe the presentation of this supplemental information is useful because the Webhelp Combination had a significant impact on revenue and cost of revenue for the post-acquisition period and the supplemental comparison enables readers to better understand changes in the combined business. These supplemental comparisons are provided for informational purposes only and may not necessarily reflect the results of operations that would have occurred had the Webhelp Combination actually occurred as of the beginning of the period referenced. 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).

 Overview and Basis of Presentation

We strive to deliver exceptional services globally supported by our deep industry knowledge, technology and security practices, talented people, and digital and analytics expertise. 
 We generate revenue from performing services that are generally tied to our clients products and services. Any shift in business or the size of the market for our clients products or services, or any failure of technology or failure of acceptance of our clients products or services in the market may impact our business. The staff turnover rate in our business is high, as is the risk of losing experienced team members. High staff turnover rates may increase costs and decrease operating efficiencies and productivity. 
 Webhelp Combination 
 
 On September 25, 2023, we completed our acquisition (the Webhelp Combination of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock (the Shares of Marnix Lux SA, a public limited liability company soci t anonyme incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Webhelp Parent and the parent company of the Webhelp business Webhelp ), from the holders thereof (the Sellers ). Webhelp was a leading provider of CX solutions, including sales, marketing, and payment services, with significant operations and client relationships in Europe, Latin America, and Africa. The acquisition was completed pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Share Purchase and Contribution Agreement, dated as of June 12, 2023, as amended by First Amendment to Share Purchase and Contribution Agreement, dated as of July 14, 2023 by and among Concentrix, OSYRIS S. r.l., a private limited liability company soci t responsabilit limit e incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Concentrix Corporation Purchaser ), Webhelp Parent, the Sellers, and certain representatives of the Sellers. 
 
 The purchase consideration for the acquisition of the Shares is valued at approximately 3,774.8 million, net of cash and restricted cash acquired. 
 
 Revenue and Cost of Revenue 
 We generate revenue through the provision of technology and services to our clients pursuant to client contracts. Our client contracts typically consist of a master services agreement, supported in most cases by multiple statements of work, which contain the terms and conditions of each contracted solution. Our client contracts can range from less than one year to over five years in term and are subject to early termination by our clients for any reason, typically with 30 to 90 days notice. 
 Our technology and services are generally characterized by flat unit prices. Approximately 97 of our revenue is recognized as services are performed, based on staffing hours or the number of client customer transactions handled using contractual rates. Remaining revenue from the sale of these solutions are typically recognized as the services are provided over the duration of the contract using contractual rates. 
 Our cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs related to the delivery of our technology and services. The costs of our revenue can be impacted by the mix of client contracts, where we deliver the technology and services, additional lead time for programs to be fully scalable, and transition and initial set-up costs. Our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue has also fluctuated in the past, based primarily on our ability to achieve economies of scale, the management of our operating expenses, and the timing and costs incurred related to our acquisitions and investments. 
 32 

Through the third quarter of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, approximately 87 and 81 , respectively, of our consolidated revenue was generated from our non-U.S. operations, and approximately 50 and 68 , respectively, of our consolidated revenue was priced in U.S. dollars. We expect that a significant amount of our revenue will continue to be generated from our non-U.S. operations while being priced in U.S. dollars. As a result, we have certain client contracts that are priced in non-U.S. dollar currencies for which a substantial portion of the costs to deliver the services are in other currencies. Accordingly, our revenue may be earned in currencies that are different from the currencies in which we incur corresponding expenses. Fluctuations in the value of currencies, such as the Philippine peso, the Indian rupee, the euro, and the Canadian dollar, against the U.S. dollar or other currencies in which we bill our clients, and inflation in the local economies in which these delivery centers are located, can impact the operating and labor costs in these delivery centers, which can result in reduced profitability. As a result, our revenue growth, costs, and profitability have been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and inflation. 
 
 Margins 
 Our gross margins fluctuate and can be impacted by the mix of client contracts, services provided, shifts in the geography from which our technology and services are delivered, client volume trends, the amount of lead time that is required for programs to become fully scaled, and transition and set-up costs. Our operating margin fluctuates based on changes in gross margins as well as overall volume levels, as we are generally able to gain scale efficiencies in our selling, general and administrative costs as our volumes increase. 
 
 Economic and Industry Trends 
 The industry in which we operate is competitive, including on the basis of pricing terms, delivery capabilities, and quality of services. Further, there can be competitive pressure for labor in various markets, which could result in increased labor costs. Accordingly, we could be subject to pricing and labor cost pressures and may experience a decrease in revenue and operating income. Our business operates globally in over 70 countries across six continents. We have significant concentrations in the Philippines, India, Brazil, the United States, T rkiye , Colombia, Egypt, the United Kingdom, Morocco, China, and elsewhere throughout EMEA, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific. Accordingly, we would be impacted by economic strength or weakness in these geographies and by the strengthening or weakening of local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. 
 
 Seasonality 
 Our revenue and margins fluctuate with the underlying trends in our clients businesses and trends in the level of consumer activity. As a result, our revenue and margins are typically higher in the fourth fiscal quarter of the year than in any other fiscal quarter. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023.

 Our revenue increased by 46.2 in the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the Webhelp Combination. For the three months ended August 31, 2024, revenue across all verticals increased, primarily as a result of the Webhelp Combination. The increase in revenue was partially offset by the negative effect of foreign currency translation of 22.5 million, or 1.4 . The unfavorable foreign currency translation effect on revenue was primarily due to the weakening of the Argentine peso and Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. If the Webhelp Combination had occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2023, our revenue would have increased by 0.9 in the three months ended August 31, 2024.

 Cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs. Gross margin can be impacted by resource location, client mix and pricing, additional lead time for programs to be fully scalable, and transition and initial set-up costs. 
 Our cost of revenue increased by 46.6 in the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023, primarily due to the increases in our revenue and personnel costs from the Webhelp Combination. The increases were partially offset by a 42.2 million, or 4.1 , reduction in our cost of revenue due to foreign currency translation. The foreign currency translation impact on our cost of revenue was caused primarily by the weakening of the Argentine peso, Egyptian pound, and Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar.

The foreign currency translation impact on our cost of revenue was caused primarily by the weakening of the Argentine peso, Philippine peso, and Egyptian pound against the U.S. dollar. If the Webhelp Combination had occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2023, our cost of revenue would have increased by 1.4 in the nine months ended August 31, 2024. 
 Our gross profit increased by 45.6 in the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023, primarily due to the increase in revenue, contributions from the Webhelp Combination, and a net favorable foreign currency impact of 19.7 million on gross profit, partially offset by the increase in cost of revenue.

 Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 64.8 in the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023, primarily due to incremental selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the Webhelp Combination, an increase in amortization expenses of 77.0 million, primarily associated with the intangible assets from the 
 35 

Webhelp Combination, and an increase in acquisition-related and integration expenses of 17.6 million. These increases were partially offset by a 9.5 million reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency translation impacts. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 26.4 in the third fiscal quarter of 2023 to 29.8 in the third fiscal quarter of 2024 due to the net effect of the changes described. 
 Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 66.9 in the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2023, primarily due to incremental selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the Webhelp Combination, an increase in amortization expenses of 230.6 million, primarily associated with the intangible assets from the Webhelp Combination, and an increase in acquisition-related and integration expenses of 65.7 million. These increases were partially offset by a 21.9 million reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses due to foreign currency translation impacts. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 26.1 in the nine months ended August 31, 2023 to 29.7 in the nine months ended August 31, 2024 due to the net effect of the changes described.

 Amounts recorded in interest expense and finance charges, net consist primarily of interest on our senior notes issued in August 2023, interest expense on term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility, interest expense on borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility ), interest expense on the promissory note issued by us to certain Sellers in connection with the Webhelp Combination (the Sellers Note and financing expenses incurred in fiscal year 2023 associated with our commitment letter dated March 29, 2023 (the Bridge Commitment Letter, and the commitments pursuant to the Bridge Commitment Letter, the Bridge Facility ), entered into in connection with the Webhelp Combination. 
 The increase in interest expense and finance charges, net for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in interest expense on our senior notes of 24.6 million, interest expense, including imputed interest, associated with the Sellers Note of 8.1 million, and a decrease in interest income related to the senior notes proceeds of 7.8 million incurred in the prior year period that did not recur. The senior notes were outstanding for only a portion of the prior year period and the Sellers Note was not outstanding in the prior year period. These changes were partially offset by a decrease of Bridge Facility financing fees of 10.7 million incurred in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 that did not recur in the current period. 
 The increase in interest expense and finance charges, net for the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in interest expense on our senior notes of 98.2 million, interest expense, including imputed interest, associated with the Sellers Note of 24.0 million and a decrease in interest income related to the

senior notes proceeds of 7.8 million incurred in the prior year period that did not recur. The senior notes were outstanding for only a portion of the prior year period and the Sellers Note was not outstanding in the prior year period.

 Other expense (income), net in the three months ended August 31, 2024 was expense of 46.0 million, compared to expense of 6.2 million in the three months ended August 31, 2023. The change in other expense (income), net over the prior fiscal year period was primarily due to net foreign currency losses and expense of 10.5 million due to the change in acquisition contingent consideration associated with the Webhelp Combination during the three months ended August 31, 2024 
 Other expense (income), net in the nine months ended August 31, 2024 was expense of 19.8 million, compared to expense of 19.3 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2023.

 Our provision for income taxes decreased in the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in income before taxes. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024 increased compared to the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, primarily due to the change in mix of income earned in different tax jurisdictions between periods.

Certain Non-GAAP Financial Information 
 
 In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, we also disclose certain non-GAAP financial information, including: 
 Non-GAAP operating income, which is operating income, adjusted to exclude acquisition-related and integration expenses, including related restructuring costs, step-up depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and share-based compensation. 
 Non-GAAP operating margin, which is non-GAAP operating income, as defined above, divided by revenue. 
 Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, which is non-GAAP operating income, as defined above, plus depreciation (exclusive of step-up depreciation). 
 Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, divided by revenue. 
 Non-GAAP net income, which is net income excluding the tax effected impact of acquisition-related and integration expenses, including related restructuring costs, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, imputed interest related to the sellers note issued in connection with the combination with Webhelp (the sellers note ), change in acquisition contingent consideration and foreign currency losses (gains), net. Non-GAAP net income also excludes the income tax effect of certain legal entity restructuring activity. 
 
 Free cash flow, which is cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, and adjusted free cash flow, which is free cash flow excluding the effect of changes in the outstanding factoring balance. We believe that free cash flow is a meaningful measure of cash flows since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations. We believe that adjusted free cash flow is a meaningful measure of cash flows because it removes the effect of factoring which changes the timing of the receipt of cash for certain receivables. However, free cash flow and adjusted cash flow have limitations because they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow do not incorporate payments for business acquisitions. 
 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per common share EPS ), which is diluted EPS excluding the per share, tax effected impact of acquisition-related and integration expenses, including related restructuring costs, step-up depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, imputed interest related to the Sellers note, change in acquisition contingent consideration and foreign currency losses (gains), net. Non-GAAP EPS also excludes the per share income tax effect of certain legal entity restructuring activity. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net income attributable to participating securities, and the per share, tax-effected impact of adjustments to net income described above reflect only those amounts that are attributable to common shareholders. 
 
 We believe that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand our base operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods and for planning and forecasting in future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business adjusted for these items in addition to GAAP results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in some cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of intangible assets. Our acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships, technology, and trade names. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in our statements of operations. Although intangible assets contribute to our revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the services performed for our clients. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of our acquisition activity. Accordingly, we believe excluding the amortization of intangible assets, along with the other non-GAAP adjustments, which neither relate to the ordinary course of our business nor reflect our underlying business performance, enhances our and our investors ability to compare our past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within our GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude share-based compensation expense. Given the subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when calculating share-based compensation expense, management believes this additional information allows investors to make additional comparisons 
 38 

between our operating results and those of our peers. As these non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures and should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary uses of cash are working capital, capital expenditures to expand our delivery footprint and enhance our technology solutions, debt repayments, and acquisition and integration expenses, including in connection with our September 2023 combination with Webhelp. Our financing needs for these uses of cash have been a combination of operating cash flows and third-party debt arrangements. Our working capital needs are primarily to finance accounts receivable. When our revenue is increasing, our net investment in working capital typically increases. Conversely, when revenue is decreasing, our net investment in working capital typically decreases. To increase our market share and better serve our clients, we may further expand our operations through investments or acquisitions. We expect that such expansion would require an initial investment in working capital, personnel, facilities, and operations. These investments or acquisitions would likely be funded primarily by our existing cash and cash equivalents, available liquidity, including capacity on our debt arrangements, or the issuance of securities. We funded the Webhelp Combination through (i) proceeds from our August 2023 offering and sale of senior notes, (ii) term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility, and (iii) cash on hand. 
 
 In September 2021, considering our strong free cash flow, low leverage, and adequate liquidity to support capital return to stockholders while maintaining flexibility to pursue acquisitions, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program. Under the share repurchase program, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of our common stock from time to time as market and business conditions warrant, including through open market purchases or Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The share repurchase program has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, we repurchased 607,298 and 1,506,983 shares, respectively, of our common stock under the share repurchase program for approximately 39.3 million and 101.6 million, respectively, in the aggregate. During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2023, we repurchased 320,105 and 430,529 shares, respectively, of our common stock under the share repurchase program for approximately 27.0 million and 41.9 million, respectively, in the aggregate. At August 31, 2024, approximately 188.5 million remained available for share repurchases under the existing authorization from our board of directors. 
 
 During September 2024, we repurchased 161,613 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 10.6 million. 
 
 During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we have paid the following dividends per share approved by our board of directors: 
 
 Announcement Date Record Date Per Share Dividend Amount Payment Date January 19, 2023 January 30, 2023 0.275 February 10, 2023 March 29, 2023 April 28, 2023 0.275 May 9, 2023 June 28, 2023 July 28, 2023 0.275 August 8, 2023 September 27, 2023 October 27, 2023 0.3025 November 7, 2023 January 24, 2024 February 5, 2024 0.3025 February 15, 2024 March 26, 2024 April 26, 2024 0.3025 May 7, 2024 June 26, 2024 July 26, 2024 0.3025 August 6, 2024 
 
 On September 25, 2024, we announced a cash dividend of 0.33275 per share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 25, 2024, payable on November 5, 2024. 
 
 We expect that future cash dividends will be paid on a quarterly basis. However, any decision to pay future cash dividends will be subject to our board of directors approval, and will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ongoing 
 41 

ability to generate cash from operations and on our access to the capital markets. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay a dividend in the future. 
 Debt Arrangements 
 Senior Notes 
 
 On August 2, 2023, we issued and sold (i) 800 million aggregate principal amount of 6.650 Senior Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes ), (ii) 800 million aggregate principal amount of 6.600 Senior Notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes and (iii) 550 million aggregate principal amount of 6.850 Senior Notes due 2033 (the 2033 Notes and, together with the 2026 Notes and 2028 Notes, the Senior Notes ). The Senior Notes were sold in a registered public offering pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-3, which became effective upon filing, and a Prospectus Supplement dated July 19, 2023, to a Prospectus dated July 17, 2023. 
 
 The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated as of August 2, 2023 (the Base Indenture ), between Concentrix and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the Trustee ), as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture dated as of August 2, 2023 between Concentrix and the Trustee relating to the 2026 Notes, a second supplemental indenture dated as of August 2, 2023 between Concentrix and the Trustee relating to the 2028 Notes, and a third supplemental indenture dated as of August 2, 2023 between Concentrix and the Trustee relating to the 2033 Notes (such supplemental indentures, together with the Base Indenture, the Indenture ). The Indenture contains customary covenants and restrictions, including covenants that limit Concentrix Corporation s and certain of its subsidiaries ability to create or incur liens on shares of stock of certain subsidiaries or on principal properties, engage in sale/leaseback transactions or, with respect to Concentrix Corporation, consolidate or merge with, or sell or lease substantially all its assets to, another person. The Indenture also provides for customary events of default. 
 
 In connection with the closing of the Webhelp Combination, we entered into cross-currency swap arrangements with certain financial institutions for a total notional amount of 500 million of the Senior Notes. In addition to aligning the currency of a portion of our interest payments to our euro-denominated cash flows, the arrangements effectively converted 250 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes and 250 million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes into synthetic fixed euro-based debt at weighted average interest rates of 5.12 and 5.18 , respectively. 
 
 Restated Credit Facility 
 
 On April 21, 2023, we entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement (the Amendment Agreement with the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. to amend and restate the Prior Credit Facility (as amended and restated, the Restated Credit Facility ). 
 The Restated Credit Facility provides for the extension of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility not to exceed an aggregate principal amount of 1,042.5 million. The Restated Credit Facility also provides for a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed approximately 2,144.7 million (the Term Loan ), of which 1,850 million was incurred upon the amendment and approximately 294.7 million was drawn on a delayed draw basis (the Delayed Draw Term Loans on the Closing Date. Aggregate borrowing capacity under the Restated Credit Facility may be increased by up to an additional 500 million by increasing the amount of the revolving credit facility or by incurring additional term loans, in each case subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Restated Credit Facility, including the receipt of additional commitments for such increase. 
 As of November 30, 2023, the outstanding principal balance on the Term Loan was 1,950 million. During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024, we voluntarily prepaid 100 million and 350 million, respectively, of the principal balance on the Term Loan, without penalty, resulting in an outstanding balance at August 31, 2024 of approximately 1,600 million. 
 The maturity date of the Restated Credit Facility remains December 27, 2026, subject, in the case of the revolving credit facility, to two one-year extensions upon our prior notice to the lenders and the agreement of the lenders to extend such maturity date. Due to the voluntary prepayments previously described, no principal payment on the term loans is due until fiscal year 2026 with the remaining outstanding principal amount due in full on the maturity date. 
 
 42 

Borrowings under the Restated Credit Facility bear interest, in the case of SOFR rate loans, at a per annum rate equal to the applicable SOFR rate (but not less than 0.0 ), plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.125 to 2.000 , based on the credit ratings of our senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-term indebtedness for borrowed money plus a credit spread adjustment to the SOFR rate of 0.10 . Borrowings under the Restated Credit Facility that are base rate loans bear interest at a per annum rate (but not less than 1.0 equal to (i) the greatest of (A) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Restated Credit Facility) in effect on such day, (B) the NYFRB Rate (as defined in the Restated Credit Facility) in effect on such day plus of 1.0 , and (C) the adjusted one-month term SOFR rate plus 1.0 per annum, plus (ii) an applicable margin, which ranges from 0.125 to 1.000 , based on the credit ratings of our senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-term indebtedness for borrowed money. 
 
 The Restated Credit Facility contains certain loan covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this type and that restrict our ability to take certain actions, including the creation of liens, mergers or consolidations, changes to the nature of our business, and, solely with respect to our subsidiaries, incurrence of indebtedness. In addition, the Restated Credit Facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter, (i) a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Restated Credit Facility) not to exceed 3.75 to 1.0 (or for certain periods following certain qualified acquisitions, including the Webhelp Combination, 4.25 to 1.0) and (ii) a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Restated Credit Facility) equal to or greater than 3.00 to 1.0. The Restated Credit Facility also contains various customary events of default, including payment defaults, defaults under certain other indebtedness, and a change of control of Concentrix Corporation. 
 
 None of our subsidiaries guarantees the obligations under the Restated Credit Facility. 
 Prior to entering into the Amendment Agreement, obligations under the Prior Credit Facility were secured by substantially all of the assets of Concentrix Corporation and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries and were guaranteed by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries. Borrowings under the Prior Credit Facility bore interest, in the case of term or daily SOFR loans, at a per annum rate equal to the applicable SOFR rate (but not less than 0.0 ), plus an adjustment of between 0.10 and 0.25 depending on the interest period of each SOFR loan, plus an applicable margin, which ranged from 1.25 to 2.00 , based on our consolidated leverage ratio. Borrowings under the Prior Credit Facility that were base rate loans bore interest at a per annum rate equal to (i) the greatest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such day plus of 1.00 , (b) the rate of interest last publicly announced by Bank of America as its prime rate and (c) the term SOFR rate plus 1.00 , plus (ii) an applicable margin, which ranged from 0.25 to 1.00 , based on our consolidated leverage ratio. From August 31, 2022 through the date of the Amendment Agreement, the outstanding principal of the term loans under the Prior Credit Facility was payable in quarterly installments of 26.25 million. 
 
 At August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, no amounts were outstanding under our revolving credit facility. 
 
 During the nine months ended August 31, 2023, we voluntarily prepaid 25.0 million of the principal balance on the term loans under the Prior Credit Facility, without penalty. 
 Securitization Facility 
 On April 25, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Securitization Facility to (i) increase the commitment of the lenders to provide available borrowings from up to 500 million to up to 600 million, (ii) extend the termination date of the Securitization Facility from July 5, 2024 to April 24, 2026, and (iii) amend the interest rate margins, such that borrowings under the Securitization Facility that are funded by certain lenders through such lenders issuance of commercial paper bear interest at the applicable commercial paper rate plus a spread of 0.80 and, otherwise, at a bank rate that includes a per annum rate equal to the applicable SOFR rate (subject to a SOFR related adjustment of 0.10 ), plus a spread of 0.90 . 
 Under the Securitization Facility, Concentrix Corporation and certain of its U.S. based subsidiaries sell or otherwise transfer all of their accounts receivable to a special purpose bankruptcy-remote subsidiary of Concentrix Corporation that grants a security interest in the receivables to the lenders in exchange for available borrowings of up to 600 million. Borrowing availability under the Securitization Facility may be limited by our accounts receivable balances, changes in the credit ratings of our clients comprising the receivables, client concentration levels in the receivables, and certain characteristics of the accounts receivable being transferred (including factors tracking performance of the accounts receivable over time). 
 
 The Securitization Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant that is consistent with the Restated Credit Facility and customary events of default, including payment defaults, defaults under certain 
 43 

other indebtedness, a change in control of Concentrix Corporation, and certain events negatively affecting the overall credit quality of the transferred accounts receivable. 
 
 Sellers Note 
 
 On September 25, 2023, as part of the consideration for the Webhelp Combination, we issued the Sellers Note in the aggregate principal amount of 700 million to certain Sellers. Pursuant to the Sellers Note, the unpaid principal amount outstanding accrues interest at a rate of two percent (2 per annum, and all principal and accrued interest will be due and payable on September 25, 2025. The stated rate of interest is below our expected borrowing rate. As a result, we discounted the Sellers Note by 31,500. The discounted value is being amortized into interest expense over the two-year term. 
 
 As of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, we were in compliance with the debt covenants related to our debt arrangements. 
 
 Cash Flows Nine Months Ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 
 The following summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, as reported in our consolidated statement of cash flows in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 Nine Months Ended August 31, 2024 August 31, 2023 in thousands) 
 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 383,091 448,744 Net cash used in investing activities (183,395) (115,717) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
 (268,074) 1,636,260 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 (6,347) (2,715) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (74,725) 1,966,572 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of year 516,487 157,463 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of the period 441,762 2,124,035 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 383.1 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 448.7 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2023. The change over the prior year period was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital and the decrease in net income. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 was 183.4 million, compared to 115.7 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2023. The increase in net cash used in investing activities over the prior year period primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures as a result of the expanded business due to the Webhelp Combination and payment of deferred cash consideration of 4.5 million related to the Webhelp Combination in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 was 268.1 million, consisting of principal payments of 350.0 million made on term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility, cash paid for acquired earnout liabilities of 22.7, share repurchases of 101.6 million, a change in funds held for clients of 25.8 million, and dividends of 61.2 million partially offset by net borrowings of 290.5 million under our Securitization Facility. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended August 31, 2023 was 1,636.3 million, consisting primarily of proceeds, before expenses, of 2,137.0 million from the issuance of Senior Notes in August 2023, partially offset by principal payments of 25.0 million made on the term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility, net repayments of 356.5 million under 
 44 

our Securitization Facility, share repurchases of 41.9 million, dividends of 42.9 million, and cash paid of 30.5 million related to debt issuance costs for the Senior Notes, financing fees for the Bridge Facility and amendment fees related to our Restated Credit Agreement. 
 
 Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measures) 
 Nine Months Ended August 31, 2024 August 31, 2023 in thousands) 
 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 383,091 448,744 Purchases of property and equipment (178,891) (115,717) Free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) 204,200 333,027 Change in outstanding factoring balances 
 51,632 Adjusted free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) 
 255,832 333,027 
 Our free cash flow was 204.2 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 333.0 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease in free cash flow for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year period was due to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities and an increase in capital expenditures as a result of the expanded business due to the Webhelp Combination. 
 Our adjusted free cash flow was 255.8 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 333.0 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease in adjusted free cash flow for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period was due to a decrease in free cash flow partially offset by a change in outstanding factoring balances of 51.6 million. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 As of August 31, 2024, we had total liquidity of 1,469.7 million, which includes undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility of 1,042.5 million, undrawn capacity of 181.0 million under our Securitization Facility and cash and cash equivalents. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents totaled 246.2 million and 295.3 million as of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively. Of our total cash and cash equivalents, 98 and 99 were held by our non-U.S. legal entities as of August 31, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively. The cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. legal entities are no longer subject to U.S. federal tax on repatriation into the United States; repatriation of some non-U.S. balances is restricted by local laws. Historically, we have fully utilized and reinvested all non-U.S. cash to fund our international operations and expansions; however, we have recorded deferred tax liabilities related to non-U.S. withholding taxes on the earnings of certain previously acquired non-U.S. entities that are likely to be repatriated in the future. If in the future our intentions change, and we repatriate the cash back to the United States, we will report in our consolidated financial statements the impact of the state and withholding taxes depending upon the planned timing and manner of such repatriation. 
 
 We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents balances, the cash flows expected to be generated from operations, and our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital, planned capital expenditures, and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financing activities. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market Risk 
 We are and will be exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices. Our risk management strategy includes 
 45 

managing these risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge economic exposures, as well as reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. In using derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposures to changes in exchange rates, we expose ourselves to counterparty credit risk. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with investment grade-rated institutions that can be expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements and by diversifying the financial institutions with which we enter into such agreements. There can be no guarantee that the risk management activities that we have entered into will be sufficient to fully offset market risk or reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. See Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion of our financial risk management. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 While approximately 50 of our revenue is priced in U.S. dollars, we recognize a substantial amount of revenue under contracts that are denominated in euros, British pounds, Japanese yen, and Brazilian real, among other currencies. A significant increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these currencies may have a material adverse effect on the value of those services when translated into U.S. dollars. 
 We serve many of our U.S.-based, European and British clients from our delivery centers located around the world. As a result, a substantial portion of the costs to deliver these services are denominated in the local currency of the country where the services are performed. This creates foreign exchange exposure for us. As of August 31, 2024, we have hedged a portion of our exposure related to the anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in certain foreign currencies by entering into hedging contracts with institutions to acquire a total of PHP 42,170.0 million at a fixed price of 740.7 million at various dates through August 2026; and INR 24,660.0 million at a fixed price of 288.7 million at various dates through August 2026. The fair value of these derivative instruments as of August 31, 2024 is presented in Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The potential loss in fair value at August 31, 2024 for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates is approximately 103.8 million. This loss would be substantially mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying foreign currency exposures. 
 Other foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. We periodically enter into hedging contracts that are not denominated as hedges. The purpose of these derivative instruments is to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exposure related to receivables, payables, and intercompany transactions that are denominated in currencies that are different from the functional currencies of our respective legal entities that are party to the transactions. As of August 31, 2024, the fair value of these derivatives not designated as hedges was a net payable of 3.7 million. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 At August 31, 2024, our outstanding debt under our Restated Credit Facility and our Securitization Facility is variable rate debt, which exposes the Company to changes in interest rates. Holding other variables constant, including the total amount of outstanding indebtedness, a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates on our variable-rate debt would cause an estimated increase in interest expense of approximately 20.2 million per year. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Concentrix in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 46 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 
 We acquired Webhelp in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. We are currently in the process of evaluating and integrating the acquired operations, processes, and internal controls. See Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on this acquisition. 
 Except for this acquisition, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our third fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 47 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations, our financial position, or the cash flows of our business. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, there were no new material legal proceedings and no material developments in any legal proceedings reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023.
