Currently,
the Company operates two business segments. 

Healthcare
Business mainly provides health consulting advisory services and healthcare and wellness products to the customers. 

Revenue
is earned from the rendering of health consulting advisory services to the customers. The Company recognizes services revenue over the
period in which such services are performed. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance
sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected
to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current
portion. 

The
sale and distribution of the healthcare products, such as (i) Nutrition Catering (ii) Special Health Food (iii) Health Supplement and
(iv) Skincare, is the only performance obligation under the fixed-fee arrangements. Revenue is recognized from the sale of their healthcare
products upon delivery to the customers, whereas the title and risk of loss are fully transferred to the customers. The Company records
its revenues, net of value added taxes VAT on the majority of the products at the rate of 17 on the invoiced value of
sales. The cost, such as shipping cost and material cost, is recognized when the product delivered to the customers. The Company records
its cost including taxes. 

Wine
Business mainly provides wine products to the customers, with a right to return. The Company acts as the principal in substantially
all of its customer arrangements and as such, generally records revenues on a gross basis. Revenues exclude any taxes that the Company
collects from customers and remits to tax authorities. Revenue is recognized from the sale of wine products upon delivery to the customers,
whereas the title and risk of loss are fully transferred to the customers. The Company records its revenues, net of value added taxes VAT on the majority of the products at the rate of on the invoiced value of sales. The revenues are presented net
of sales returns and discounts. The Company recorded product sales returns for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.
The cost, such as shipping cost and material cost, is recognized when the product delivered to the customers. The Company records its
cost including taxes.

. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes,
accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized
income tax benefits according to the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13. 

The
estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying
balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred
tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.

The
financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense
allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the
preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a) the
nature of the relationship(s) involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts
were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding
of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which
income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding
period; and d) amount due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the

and suffered from a working capital deficit of
 as of September 30, 2024. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support
from its stockholders. Management believes the existing stockholders will provide the additional cash to meet with the Company s
obligations as they become due. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain
the operations. 

These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification
of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. The Company has no current plans to issue any shares
of preferred stock.

(c)
Credit risk 

Financial
instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. The Company believes the concentration
of credit risk in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively short collection
terms. The Company does not generally require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful
accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information. 

(d)
Economic and political risk 

The
Company s major operations are conducted in the PRC. Accordingly, the political, economic, and legal environments in the PRC, as
well as the general state of the PRC s economy may influence the Company s business, financial condition, and results of
operations. 

(e)
Exchange rate risk 

The
Company cannot guarantee that the current exchange rate will remain steady; therefore there is a possibility that the Company could post
the same amount of profit for two comparable periods and because of the fluctuating exchange rate actually post higher or lower profit
depending on exchange rate of RMB converted to US on that date. The exchange rate could fluctuate depending on changes in political
and economic environments without notice.

written or oral statements that are forward-looking, including statements contained in this Quarterly Report and other
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our Company s stockholders. Management believes that all
statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters, as well as from developments beyond our Company s
control including changes in global economic conditions are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. These statements
are made on the basis of management s views and assumptions, as of the time the statements are made, regarding future events and
business performance. There can be no assurance, however, that management s expectations will necessarily come to pass. Factors
that may affect forward-looking statements include a wide range of factors that could materially affect future developments and performance,
including the following: 

Changes
in Company-wide strategies, which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which our Company is involved or chooses
to invest; changes in U.S., global or regional economic conditions; changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including
significant interest rate fluctuations, which may impede our Company s access to, or increase the cost of, external financing for
our operations and investments; increased competitive pressures, both domestically and internationally; legal and regulatory developments,
such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities; the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions and changes
in international tax laws or currency controls; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes;
and labor disputes, which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations. 

This
list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements are illustrative, but by no means exhaustive. 

Accordingly,
all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.

Revenue.
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues of 22,403 and 50,020, respectively. For the comparative
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated revenues of 5,293 and 24,338, respectively. The increase in revenue can be attributed to the rising demand in the Chinese wine market. This increase in demand
has led to higher sales volumes, driving a notable revenue boost. 

Cost
of Revenue . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the cost of revenue was 21,088 and 28,529, respectively, and
as a percentage of net revenue, approximately 94 and 57 , Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was
 1,619 and 12,654, respectively, and as a percentage of net revenue, approximately 31 and 52 , respectively. The cost of revenue also rose substantially for the three and nine months of 2024, largely due to sourcing products
from vendors with higher costs. This increase in procurement costs has impacted the overall cost structure, raising the cost of revenue
as a percentage of net revenue. 

Gross
Profit . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the gross profit was 1,315 and 3,674, respectively, the gross profit
margin was 6 and 69 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the gross profit was 21,491 and 11,684,
respectively, the gross profit margin was 43 and 48 , respectively. The decrease in gross profit margin for the periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023,
is primarily due to increased cost of revenue from sourcing products at higher costs, which offset the revenue growth driven by rising
demand in the Chinese wine market. 

22 

Operating
Expenses . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the operating cost was 111,984 and 318,454, respectively, and
while for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 117,238 and 367,413, respectively. The operating expenses decreased
due to a decrease in administrative expenses. 

Other
Income . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the total other income was 39 and 666, respectively and while for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 13 and 595, respectively. The other income increased due to an increase in receipt
of bank interest income. 

Income Tax Expense : For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expenses were 16,543 and 835, respectively, whereas there were no income
tax expenses for the same periods in 2023. The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to an under-provision of profit tax in
our Hong Kong company in previous years, resulting from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Net
Loss. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 127,173 and 297,132, respectively and for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred a net loss of 113,551 and 355,134, respectively. The increase in net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributed to the rise in the
cost of revenue during the period, while the decrease in net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was mainly due to increased
revenue from the wine market. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 65,565. 

As
of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 174,877. 

We
believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed below are adequate to support general operations for at least
the next 12 months.

however, to finance our operations and future acquisitions.

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and it is not anticipated that the Company will enter into any off-balance sheet
arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management
to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of
commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our
financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations.
Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations
and require management s subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of
their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly
from management s current judgments. We believe the following accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our financial
statements. 

The
Company s accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 and 2 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
As discussed in Note 1 and 2, the preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
about the future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Management bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
differences could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes that the following addresses
the Company s most critical accounting policies. 

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax assets will be reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will
be realized. A valuation allowance has currently been recorded to reduce our deferred tax asset to 0. 

Forward-looking
Statements 

The
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by
or on behalf of our Company. Our Company and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward-looking, 
including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our Company s
stockholders. Management believes that all statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters, as well
as from developments beyond our Company s control including changes in global economic conditions are forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Act. These statements are made on the basis of management s views and assumptions, as of the time the
statements are made, regarding future events and business performance. There can be no assurance, however, that management s expectations
will necessarily come to pass. Factors that may affect forward-looking statements include a wide range of factors that could materially
affect future developments and performance, including the following: 

Changes
in Company-wide strategies, which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which our Company is involved or chooses
to invest; changes in U.S., global or regional economic conditions; changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including
significant interest rate fluctuations, which may impede our Company s access to, or increase the cost of, external financing for
our operations and investments; increased competitive pressures, both domestically and internationally; legal and regulatory developments,
such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities; the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions and changes
in international tax laws or currency controls; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes;
and labor disputes, which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations. 

24 

This
list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements is illustrative, but by no means exhaustive. 

Accordingly,
all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not
required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
for the Company. 

(a)
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, our President and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by this report were not effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports
filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected but
we believe the controls and procedures do provide a reasonable assurance. To mitigate these issues, we established clearer communication
protocols to ensure prompt information flow to management, launched a comprehensive SEC compliance training program, and increased the
frequency of manual control reviews. These steps collectively provide reasonable assurance in our reporting process, despite the inherent
limitations of any control system. 

(b)
 Changes in the Company s Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting.
