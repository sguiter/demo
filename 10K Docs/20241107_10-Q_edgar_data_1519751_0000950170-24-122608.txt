million of pension plan obligations and related assets of two of its defined benefit pension plans, the MasterLock Pension Plan and the Moen Incorporated Pension Plan (collectively, the "Plans"). The purchase of the group annuity contracts by the Company closed on October 15, 2024 and November 4, 2024, respectively. The contracts cover approximately participants and beneficiaries (the Transferred Participants ). All Transferred Participants will continue to receive their benefits from the Plans until January 1, 2025, at which time the insurance company will begin paying and administering the retirement benefits of the Transferred Participants. The transactions result in no changes to the amount of benefits payable to the Transferred Participants. As a result of these transactions, which were funded with existing assets of the Plans and which did not require any additional funding contributions from the Company, the Company expects to recognize a total non-cash, pre-tax pension settlement charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of 2024. The actual charge will depend on finalization of the actuarial and other assumptions.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included in this report, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2023, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. 
 
 This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical statements of fact and those regarding our intent, belief or expectations for our business, operations, financial performance or financial condition in addition to statements regarding our general business strategies, the market potential of our brands, trends in the housing market, the potential impact of costs, including material and labor costs, the potential impact of inflation, expected capital spending, expected pension contributions or de-risking initiatives, and the expected impact of acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions. Statements preceded by, followed by, or that otherwise include the words believes, expects, anticipates, intends, projects, estimates, plans, outlook, positioned, "confident," "opportunity," focus and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will, should, would, may, and could are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections of our management about our industry, business and future financial results, available at the time this report is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those indicated in such statements, including but not limited to: (i) our reliance on the North American and Chinese home improvement, repair and remodel and new home construction activity levels, (ii) the housing market, downward changes in the general economy, unfavorable interest rates or other business conditions, (iii) the competitive nature of consumer and trade brand businesses, (iv) our ability to execute on our strategic plans and the effectiveness of our strategies in the face of business competition, (v) our reliance on key customers and suppliers, including wholesale distributors and dealers and retailers, (vi) risks relating to rapidly evolving technological change, (vii) risks associated with our ability to improve organizational productivity and global supply chain efficiency and flexibility, (viii) risks associated with global commodity and energy availability and price volatility, as well as the possibility of sustained inflation, (ix) delays or outages in our information technology systems or computer networks, or breaches of our information technology systems or other cybersecurity incidents, (x) risks associated with doing business globally, including changes in trade-related tariffs and risks with uncertain trade environments, (xi) risks associated with the disruption of operations, (xii) our inability to obtain raw materials and finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner, (xiii) risks associated with entering into potential strategic acquisitions and joint ventures and related integration activities, (xiv) impairments in the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets, (xv) risks of increases in our defined benefit-related costs and funding requirements, (xvi) our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and other labor constraints, (xvii) the effect of climate change and the impact of related changes in government regulations and consumer preferences, (xviii) risks associated with environmental, social and governance matters, (xix) potential liabilities and costs from claims and litigation, (xx) changes in government and industry regulatory standards, (xxi) future tax law changes or the interpretation of existing tax laws, (xxii) our ability to secure and protect our intellectual property rights, (xxiii) the impact of COVID-19 on the business, (xxiv) our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the separation of MasterBrand, Inc.

These and other factors are discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. We undertake no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any such obligation to, update or clarify any forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, new information or changes to future results over time or otherwise, except as required by law.

OVERVIEW 
 
 References to Fortune Brands, the Company, we, our and us refer to Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole, unless the context otherwise requires. The Company is a leading innovation company dedicated to creating smarter, safer and more beautiful homes and improving lives that competes in attractive long-term growth markets in our product categories. The Company s driving purpose is to elevate every life by transforming spaces into havens. 
 
 We believe that the Company has certain competitive advantages including market-leading brands, a diversified mix of channels, lean and flexible supply chains, a strong capital structure, as well as a tradition of strong innovation and customer service. We are focused on outperforming our markets in growth, profitability and returns in order to drive increased stockholder value. We believe the Company s track record reflects the long-term attractiveness and potential of the categories we serve and our leading brands. The long-term outlook for our products remain favorable, and our strategic advantages, including the set of capabilities we refer to as the Fortune Brands Advantage, helps us to continue to achieve profitable organic growth. 
 
 We continue to believe our most attractive opportunities are to invest in profitable organic growth initiatives, pursue accretive strategic acquisitions, non-controlling equity investments, and joint ventures, and return cash to stockholders through a combination of dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program as explained in further detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 
 
 The U.S. market for our products primarily consists of spending on both new home construction and repair and remodel activities within existing homes, with a substantial majority of the markets we serve consisting of repair and remodel spending. Continued growth in the U.S. market for our home products will largely depend on consumer confidence, employment, wage growth, home prices, stable mortgage rates and credit availability. Increases in inflation and mortgage rates during the preceding years have slowed the pace of single-family and existing home sales activity and new home construction and repair and remodel activities. However, we believe we are well positioned to manage what we expect to be a short-term slow-down in the housing market as we believe the fundamental drivers of the housing market remain intact. 
 
 We have been and may continue to be impacted by near-term supply, labor and freight constraints, a volatile global supply chain environment, as well as sustained but easing increased rates of inflation, changes in interest rates, unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the ongoing costs of tariffs. We continue to manage these challenges and are diligently working to offset potential unfavorable impacts of these items through continuous productivity improvement initiatives and price increases. 
 
 On February 29, 2024, we acquired 100 of the outstanding equity of Wise Water Solutions LLC, doing business as SpringWell Water Filtration Systems ("SpringWell"), for a purchase price of 105.6 million, subject to post-closing adjustments, net of cash acquired of 1.4 million. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit arrangements. The results of SpringWell are reported as part of the Water Innovations ("Water") segment. We have not included pro forma financial information as the transaction is immaterial to our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The fair value allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of February 29, 2024, was 105.6 million, which includes 84.4 million of goodwill. Goodwill includes expected sales and cost synergies and is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 
 
 In June 2023, we acquired the Emtek and Schaub premium and luxury door and cabinet hardware business (the "Emtek and Schaub Business") and the U.S. and Canadian Yale and August residential smart locks business (the "Yale and August Business", and, collectively with the Emtek and Schaub Business, the "Acquired Businesses") from ASSA ABLOY, Inc. and its affiliates ("ASSA"). The Company completed the acquisition for a total purchase price of approximately 813.9 million, net of cash acquired of 21.9 million. During the second quarter of 2024, legal title to international operations in Vietnam transferred to us, which included a payment of approximately 23.5 million, net of cash of 5.6 million (which amount is already included in the overall purchase price). We financed the transaction with cash on hand. The results of the Emtek and Schaub Business are reported as part of the Water segment, and the results of the Yale and August Business are reported as part of the Security segment.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, cash borrowed under our credit facility and cash from debt issuances in the capital markets. Our operating income is generated by our subsidiaries. We believe our operating cash flows, including funds available under the credit facility and access to capital markets, provide sufficient liquidity to support the Company s working capital requirements, capital expenditures and service of indebtedness, as well as to finance acquisitions, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends to stockholders, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate. 
 Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 30, 2023 entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors . In addition, we cannot predict whether or when we may enter into acquisitions, joint ventures or dispositions, repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program or pay dividends, or what impact any such transactions could have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, whether as a result of the issuance of debt or equity securities, or otherwise. 
 Long-Term Debt 
 At September 28, 2024, the Company had aggregate outstanding notes in the principal amount of 2.7 billion, with varying maturities (the Notes ). The Notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company. In addition, we believe that we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing if required. The following table provides a summary of the Company s outstanding Notes, including the net carrying value of the Notes, net of underwriting commissions, price discounts and debt issuance costs as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023:

Credit Facilities 
 
 In August 2022, the Company entered into a third amended and restated 1.25 billion revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Agreement ), and borrowings thereunder will be used for general corporate purposes. The maturity date of the facility is August 2027. Interest rates under the Revolving Credit Agreement are variable based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") at the time of the borrowing and the Company s long-term credit rating and can range from SOFR + 1.02 to SOFR + 1.525 . Under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company is required to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of 3.0 to 1.0. Consolidated EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, losses from asset impairments, and certain other one-time adjustments. In addition, the Company's ratio of consolidated debt minus certain cash and cash equivalents to consolidated EBITDA generally may not exceed 3.5 to 1.0. There were no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. As of September 28, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under this facility. 
 
 We currently have uncommitted bank lines of credit in China, which provide for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to 30.5 million in aggregate as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. There were no outstanding balances as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. 
 
 Commercial Paper 
 
 The Company operates a commercial paper program (the Commercial Paper Program pursuant to which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes. The Company's Revolving Credit Agreement is the liquidity backstop for the repayment of any notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program, and as such borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are included in Long-term debt in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed, with the aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time, including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement, not to exceed 1.25 billion. The Company will use any issuances under the Commercial Paper Program 
 30 

for general corporate purposes. Outstanding borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were 104.7 million and zero, respectively. 
 Cash and Seasonality 
 On September 28, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 344.8 million, of which 314.9 million was held at non-U.S. subsidiaries. We manage our global cash requirements considering (i) available funds among the subsidiaries through which we conduct business, (ii) the geographic location of our liquidity needs, and (iii) the cost to access international cash balances. The repatriation of non-U.S. cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences as we may be required to pay and record tax expense on those funds that are repatriated. 
 
 Our operating cash flows are significantly impacted by the seasonality of our business. We typically generate most of our operating cash flow in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of each year. 
 
 We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, and amounts available under our revolving credit facility should be sufficient for our operating requirements and enable us to fund our capital expenditures and service of indebtedness, as well as to finance acquisitions, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends to stockholders, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate. 
 Share Repurchases and Dividends 
 On January 29, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 650 million of shares of the Company s outstanding common stock over the next two years on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise (including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, block trades and accelerated share repurchase transactions), in accordance with applicable securities laws. 
 In the first thirty-nine weeks of 2024, we repurchased 2.6 million shares of our outstanding common stock under the Company s share repurchase program for 190.4 million. As of September 28, 2024, the Company s total remaining share repurchase authorization under its share repurchase program was approximately 534 million. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
 In the first thirty-nine weeks of 2024, we paid dividends in the amount of 90.0 million to the Company s stockholders. Our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate dividend payment opportunities on a quarterly basis. There can be no assurance as to when and if future dividends will be paid, and at what level, because the payment of dividends is dependent on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. There are no restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Fortune Brands. 
 Acquisitions 
 On February 29, 2024, we acquired 100 of the outstanding equity of SpringWell for a purchase price of 105.6 million, subject to post-closing adjustments, net of cash acquired of 1.4 million. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facility. The results of SpringWell are reported as part of the Water segment. We have not included pro forma financial information as the transaction is immaterial to our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The fair value allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of February 29, 2024, was 105.6 million, which includes 84.4 million of goodwill. Goodwill includes expected sales and cost synergies and is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 
 In June 2023, we acquired the Acquired Businesses from ASSA. The Company completed the acquisition for a total purchase price of approximately 813.9 million, net of cash acquired of 21.9 million. We financed the transaction with cash on hand. During the second quarter of 2024, legal title to international operations in Vietnam transferred to us, which included a payment of approximately 23.5 million, net of cash of 5.6 million (which amount is already included in the overall purchase price). The results of the Emtek and Schaub Business are reported as part of the Water segment and the results of the Yale and August Business are reported as part of the Security segment. 
 31 

We periodically review our portfolio of brands and evaluate potential strategic transactions and other capital initiatives to increase stockholder value. 
 Cash Flows 
 Below is a summary of cash flows for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

(189.7) 

Net cash provided by operating activities was 395.5 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 835.6 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities of 440.1 million was primarily due to an increase in inventory balances compared to the prior period as result of our 2023 initiative to decrease inventory balances to align with the U.S. home product market activity, as well as a decrease in accounts payable. The 84.2 million settlement of our interest rate swaps in 2023 and decreased accrued expenses and other liabilities also contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by higher net income in 2024. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 258.7 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to net cash used in investing activities of 957.0 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used investing activities of 698.3 million reflects the acquisition of the Acquired Businesses for approximately 800 million in June 2023 as compared to the acquisition of SpringWell for 105.6 million in 2024, as well as a decrease in capital expenditures of 42.6 million. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 183.1 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to cash used in financing activities of 60.6 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in financing activities of 122.5 million was primarily due to higher share repurchases in 2024 as compared to 2023 70.3 million) and lower net borrowings in 2024 as compared to 2023 50.1 million). 
 Pension Plans 
 
 Subsidiaries of Fortune Brands sponsor their respective defined benefit pension plans that are funded by a portfolio of investments maintained within our benefit plan trust. As of December 30, 2023, the fair value of our total pension plan assets was 468.0 million, representing funding of about 96 of the accumulated benefit obligation liability. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, we made no pension contributions. For the foreseeable future, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet the minimum funding that may be required by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. 
 
 Refer to Note 18, "Subsequent Events," in Item 1 for a discussion of the settlement of a portion of the Company's pension obligations as a part of our de-risking strategy. 
 Foreign Exchange 
 
 We have operations in various foreign countries, principally Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, China, South Africa, Vietnam and France. Therefore, changes in the value of the related currencies affect our financial statements when translated into U.S. dollars. 
 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 Refer to Note 2, "Recently Issued Accounting Standards," in Item 1 for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards.

Item 3. 	 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 There have been no material changes in the information provided in the section entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. 
 Item 4. 	 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

The Company s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 (b)	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
 
 There have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 33 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. 	 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 (a) Litigation. 

The Company is a defendant in lawsuits that are ordinary, routine litigation matters incidental to its businesses. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending actions, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that these actions could be decided unfavorably to the Company. The Company believes that there are meritorious defenses to these actions and that these actions will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, and where appropriate, these actions are being vigorously contested. Accordingly, the Company believes the likelihood of material loss is remote. 
 (b) Environmental. 

We are involved in remediation activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from other third parties. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop estimates of environmental remediation exposures. Some of the potential liabilities relate to sites we own, and some relate to sites we no longer own or never owned. Several of our subsidiaries have been designated as potentially responsible parties PRP under Superfund or similar state laws. In most instances where our subsidiaries are named as a PRP, we enter into cost-sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP liability, but very rarely, if ever, receive reimbursement from insurance for PRP costs. We believe compliance with current environmental protection laws (before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties) will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
 Item 1A. 	 RIS K FACTORS. 
 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. 
 Item 2. 	 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUIT Y SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 
 Below are the repurchases of common stock by the Company or any affiliated purchaser (as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act) for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024:

Item 5. 	 OTHER INFORMATION. 
 
 Securities Trading Plans of Directors and Officers 
 
 A significant portion of the compensation of our officers is delivered in the form of equity awards, including performance share awards, restricted stock units and stock options. The Company s compensation programs and practices are designed to pay for performance and to align management s interests with those of the Company s stockholders while attracting, motivating and retaining superior talent to lead our Company. In addition, members of the Board of Directors receive a portion of their compensation in Company common stock. Our executive officers and directors may engage from time to time in the open-market sale or other transactions involving those securities, and may also purchase our securities. 
 
 Transactions in our securities by our directors and officers are required to be made in accordance with our Insider Trading Policy, which, among other things, requires that the transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables prearranged transactions in securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions at a future date while possibly in possession of material nonpublic information. Our directors and officers are permitted to enter into trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, none of our directors or officers or a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or adopted or terminated a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K).
