REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 

Stockholders of PishPosh, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of PishPosh, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders 
deficit, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the
period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has
experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, which raises substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note
2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

/s/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2020. March 28, 2024

A Preferred Stock of the Company, may be issued in lieu of shares of common stock. Upon the closing of the Merger, PishPosh, Inc. became
the surviving corporation. 

The Merger is being
treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization effected by a unit-share exchange for financial accounting and reporting purposes. Pish
Posh is treated as the accounting acquirer as its members controlled the Company after the conversion of membership interests into the
Company s common shares, even though the Company was the legal acquirer and surviving corporation. As a result, the assets
and liabilities and the historical operations of Pish Posh are reflected in the financial statements of the Company. Since
the Company had no operations upon the Merger, the transaction was treated as a recapitalization for accounting purposes and no goodwill
or other intangible assets were recorded. The accompanying financial statements have been presented to retroactively present the effect
of the Merger, including common and preferred stock and additional paid-in capital.

retail location, website and other e-commerce channels. The Company s headquarters are in Lakewood, New Jersey. 

and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively, and has negative cash flows from operations for
the years then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months from the date of this Annual Report is dependent
upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations, which it has not been able to accomplish to
date, and/or to obtain additional capital financing. Through the date of this Annual Report, the Company has been primarily financed
through the issuance of loans and proceeds from the sale of preferred and common stock. The Company is seeking to raise capital via an
equity offering. In the event the Company does not complete an offering, the Company expects to seek additional funding through private
equity or debt financings. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that the Company
cannot generate sufficient revenue to sustain its operations, the Company will need to reduce expenses or obtain financing through the
sale of debt and/or equity securities. The issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to existing shareholders. If the Company
is unable to obtain additional funds when they are needed or if such funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to the Company, the
Company would be unable to execute upon the business plan or pay costs and expenses as they are incurred, which would have a material,
adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful
in these efforts. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

As of March 28,
2024, the Company has a cash position of approximately . Based upon the current cash position and the Company s planned expense
run rate, management believes the Company has funds currently to finance its operations through May 2024.

in deferred offering
costs, pertain to costs incurred in 2022 and 2021 when the Company initiated its public offering efforts. 
These costs include legal fees and accounting fees related to the Company s previous audits. Management believes that these
costs should not be impaired as of December 31, 2023 as they still provide economic benefits for the Company s potential public
offering. All initial offering costs incurred have enabled the Company to achieve and maintain SEC effectiveness, which is a key
component of the Company s ability to undergo a successful initial public offering. Management will continue to monitor any
further delay or abandonment of the contemplated public offering. If any further delays are expected, the Company may have to impair
a substantial, or all, of its deferred offering costs.

The Company determines
whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception by evaluating potential lease agreements including services and operating agreements
to determine whether an identified asset exists that the Company controls over the term of the arrangement. Lease commencement is determined
to be when the lessor provides access to, and the right to control, the identified asset. 

The rental payments
for the Company s leases are typically structured as either fixed or variable payments. Fixed rent payments include stated minimum
rent and stated minimum rent with stated increases. The Company considers lease payments that cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty
upon lease commencement to be variable lease payments, which are recorded as incurred each period and are excluded from the calculation
of lease liabilities. 

Management uses
judgment in determining lease classification, including determination of the economic life and the fair market value of the identified
asset. The fair market value of the identified asset is generally estimated based on comparable market data provided by third-party sources. 

The Company has
three sublease arrangements for total sublease income of approximately per month. All subleases are month to month.

In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all

of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating losses and temporary differences become deductible. Management
