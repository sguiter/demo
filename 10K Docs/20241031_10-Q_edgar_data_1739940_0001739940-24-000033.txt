Future policy benefits excluding deferred profit liability were billion as of September 30, 2024, billion as of September 30, 2023, and billion as of both December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The decrease in future policy benefit reserve as of both September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by benefit payments and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 current discount rate increases were an additional factor contributing to the decrease in future policy benefit reserve. For both periods, the decreases were partially offset by interest accretion. Undiscounted expected future policy benefits were billion as of September 30, 2024 and billion as of September 30, 2023.

and effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were higher than the and rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

million in deferred tax assets ("DTAs") associated with the impairment of equity securities as well as unrealized investment losses which are partially recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. A valuation allowance of million, established in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, drove the higher effective tax rate and was almost entirely related to the impairment of equity securities discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For the remainder of the DTAs, we have determined that a valuation allowance is not currently required based on the Company's ability to carry back losses and ability and intent to hold certain securities until recovery. We continue to monitor and evaluate the need for any additional valuation allowance. 

As of September 30, 2024, employers maintained assets that generally exceeded the benefit obligations under these arrangements of approximately million. there were additional liabilities required for these guarantees, net of reinsurance, as of September 30, 2024.

On April 19, 2016, in response to Elevance's complaint, Express Scripts filed its answer denying Elevance's Allegations in their entirety and asserting affirmative defenses and counterclaims against Elevance. The court subsequently granted Elevance's motion to dismiss of counts of Express Scripts' amended counterclaims. Express Scripts filed its Motion for Summary Judgment on August 27, 2021. Elevance completed filing of its Response to Express Scripts' Motion for Summary Judgment on October 16, 2021. Express Scripts filed its Reply in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment on November 19, 2021. On March 31, 2022, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Express Scripts on all of Elevance's pricing claims for damages totaling billion and on most of Elevance's claims relating to service issues. Elevance's only remaining service claims relate to the review or processing of prior authorizations, with alleged damages over million. On November 1, 2023, the parties signed a settlement agreement pursuant to which Express Scripts agreed to resolve the service-related claims. The settlement agreement is not an admission of liability or fault by Express Scripts, the Company or its subsidiaries. Following the settlement, Elevance retained the right to appeal the pricing-related claims that were previously dismissed by the court and Express Scripts retained the ability to reassert its own pricing-related claims in the event any appeal by Elevance is successful. Elevance filed its Notice of Appeal of its pricing-related claims on December 12, 2023. Elevance filed its opening appellate brief on April 24, 2024. Express Scripts filed its answering appellate brief on July 24, 2024. Oral arguments before the Second Circuit were held on October 22, 2024.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition as of September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023 and our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods last year and is intended to help you understand the ongoing trends in our business. We encourage you to read this MD A in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 ("2023 Form 10-K"). In particular, we encourage you to refer to the "Risk Factors" contained in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Unless otherwise indicated, financial information in this MD A is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's significant accounting policies and see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for updates to those policies resulting from adopting new accounting guidance, if any. The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements necessarily relies heavily on estimates. This and certain other factors call for caution in estimating full-year results based on interim results of operations. In some of our financial tables in this MD A, we present either percentage changes or "N/M" when those changes are so large as to become not meaningful. Changes in percentages are expressed in basis points ("bps"). 

In this MD A, our consolidated measures "adjusted income from operations," earnings per share on that same basis and "adjusted revenues" are not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable GAAP measures of "shareholders' net income," "earnings per share" and "total revenues." We also use pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations and adjusted revenues to measure the results of our segments. 
 The Company uses "pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations" and "adjusted revenues" as its principal financial measures of segment operating performance because management believes these metrics reflect the underlying results of business operations and facilitate analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and profitability. We define adjusted income (loss) from operations as shareholders' net income (or income (loss) before income taxes less pre-tax income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the segment metric) excluding net realized investment results, amortization of acquired intangible assets and special items. The Cigna Group's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded. Special items are matters that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to their nature or size. Adjusted income (loss) from operations is measured on an after-tax basis for consolidated results and on a pre-tax basis for segment results. Consolidated adjusted income (loss) from operations is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income. See the below Financial Highlights section for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted income from operations to shareholders' net income. 
 The Company defines adjusted revenues as total revenues excluding the following adjustments: special items and The Cigna Group's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting. Special items are matters that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to their nature or size. We exclude these items from this measure because management believes they are not indicative of past or future underlying performance of the business. Adjusted revenues is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, total revenues. See the below Financial Highlights section for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted revenues to total revenues.

Commentary: Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The commentary presented below, and the segment discussions that follow, compare results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 with results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Unless specified otherwise, commentary applies to both the three and nine month periods. In addition to the below, see the "Segment Reporting" section of this MD A for further commentary. 

Shareholders' net income decreased 48 and 51 , as higher earnings in Evernorth Health Services in both periods, as well as higher earnings in Cigna Healthcare for the nine months ended were more than offset by the impairment of VillageMD equity securities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment of VillageMD equity securities. 
 Adjusted income from operations increased 5 and 8 , reflecting higher earnings in Evernorth Health Services in both periods, as well as higher earnings in Cigna Healthcare for the nine months ended. 
 Medical customers decreased 3 , primarily reflecting a decrease in Individual and Family Plans customers. 
 Pharmacy revenues increased 40 and 35 , primarily reflecting higher utilization of prescription drugs from customer growth in Evernorth Health Services. 
 Premiums increased 4 in both periods, primarily reflecting higher premiums in our U.S. Healthcare operating segment to cover expected increases in underlying medical costs. 
 Fees and other revenues increased 22 and 13 , primarily reflecting growth in affordability services within our Pharmacy Benefit Services operating segment. 
 Net investment income decreased 74 and 21 , primarily due to establishing a 182 million impairment of dividend receivable in the third quarter of 2024 related to VillageMD accrued dividends. 
 Pharmacy and other service costs increased 41 and 35 , primarily reflecting higher utilization of prescription drugs from customer growth in Evernorth Health Services. 
 Medical costs and other benefit expenses increased 7 and 5 , primarily reflecting higher medical costs in our U.S. Healthcare operating segment. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by the absence of litigation settlements that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased 2 for the nine 
 41 

months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by strategic investments to support both business growth and continued advancement of our digital capabilities and solutions. 
 Realized investment results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflect the impairment of VillageMD equity securities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impairment of VillageMD equity securities. 
 The effective tax rate increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by a valuation allowance related to the impairment of VillageMD equity securities. 

Developments 

Sale of Medicare Advantage and Related Businesses 
 In January 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Plans, Medicare and Other Supplemental Benefits and CareAllies businesses within the U.S. Healthcare operating segment to Health Care Service Corporation ("HCSC"), subject to applicable regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025 and provide approximately 3.7 billion in transaction value, which consists primarily of the purchase price cash subject to adjustments to align with the final balance sheet of the divested businesses. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 Medicare Star Quality Ratings ("Star Ratings") 
 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") uses a Star Rating system to measure how well Medicare Advantage ("MA") plans perform. Categories of measurement include quality of care and customer service. Star Ratings range from one to five stars. CMS recognizes plans with Star Ratings of four stars or greater with quality bonus payments and the ability to offer enhanced benefits. On October 10, 2024, CMS announced Medicare Star Ratings for bonus payments to be received in 2026. We estimate 69 of our MA customers to be in four star or greater plans for bonus payments to be received in 2025 and 2026. See Part I, Item I. "Business - Regulation" section of our 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of Star Ratings. 

Medicare Advantage Rates 
 
 On April 1, 2024, CMS released the final Calendar Year 2025 Medicare Advantage Program and Part D Payment Policies (the "2025 Final Notice"). The Final Notice reflects no change from the January 31, 2024 advance notice. We do not expect the final rates to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations in 2025. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Liquidity 
 We maintain liquidity at two levels: the subsidiary level and the parent company level. 
 Cash requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of: 
 pharmacy, medical costs and other benefit payments; 
 expense requirements, primarily for employee compensation and benefits, information technology and facilities costs; 
 income taxes; and 
 debt service. 
 Our subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by: 
 maintaining appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments; 
 using cash flows from operating activities; 
 matching investment durations to those estimated for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities; 
 selling investments; and 
 borrowing from affiliates, subject to applicable regulatory limits. 
 42 

Cash requirements at the parent company level generally consist of: 
 debt service; 
 payment of declared dividends to shareholders; 
 lending to subsidiaries as needed; and 
 pension plan funding. 
 The parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by: 
 maintaining appropriate levels of cash and various types of marketable investments; 
 collecting dividends from its subsidiaries; 
 using proceeds from issuing debt and common stock; and 
 borrowing from its subsidiaries, subject to applicable regulatory limits. 
 Dividends from our insurance, Health Maintenance Organization ("HMO") and certain foreign subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding these restrictions. Most of the Evernorth Health Services segment operations are not subject to regulatory restrictions regarding dividends and therefore provide significant financial flexibility to The Cigna Group. 
 
 With respect to our investment portfolio, we support the liquidity needs of our businesses by managing the duration of assets to be consistent with the duration of liabilities. We manage the portfolio to both optimize returns in the current economic environment and meet our liquidity needs. 

Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30 were as follows: Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2024 2023 Operating activities 5,151 10,346 Investing activities (1,911) (4,734) Financing activities (4,399) (3,044) 
 
 The following discussion explains variances in the various categories of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. 

Operating activities 
 Cash flows from operating activities consist principally of cash receipts and disbursements for pharmacy revenues and costs, premiums, fees, investment income, taxes, benefit costs and other expenses. 
 Operating cash flows decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher accounts receivable as a result of timing and organic business growth, higher insurance claims and related payments, as well as the absence of an early CMS payment received in September 2023. This decrease is partially offset by the favorable net cash flow impacts of new clients in Evernorth Health Services. 
 Investing activities 
 The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to lower purchases of equity securities. 
 Financing activities 
 The Company had higher share repurchases, including the completed ASR Agreements (described below), partially offset by net cash provided by debt financing activities in 2024. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 Our capital resources consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and investments maintained at regulated subsidiaries required to underwrite insurance risks, cash flows from operating activities, our commercial paper program, credit agreements and the issuance of long-term debt and equity securities. Our businesses generate significant cash flows from operations, some of which is subject to regulatory restrictions relative to the amount and timing of dividend payments to the parent company. Dividends received from U.S. regulated subsidiaries were 1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.8 billion for the nine months ended 
 43 

September 30, 2023. Non-regulated subsidiaries also generate significant cash flows from operating activities, which is typically available immediately to the parent company for general corporate purposes. 
 We prioritize our use of capital resources to: 
 invest in capital expenditures, primarily related to technology to support innovative solutions for our clients and customers, provide the capital necessary to maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries and to repay debt and fund pension obligations if necessary; 
 pay dividends to shareholders; 
 consider acquisitions and investments that are strategically and economically advantageous; and 
 return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. 
 Funds Available 
 Commercial Paper Program . The Cigna Group maintains a commercial paper program and may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes privately placed on a discount basis through certain broker-dealers at any time not to exceed an aggregate amount of 6.5 billion. The net proceeds of issuances have been and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The commercial paper program had approximately 1.6 billion outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 Revolving Credit Agreements. Our revolving credit agreements provide us with the ability to borrow amounts for general corporate purposes, including for the purpose of providing liquidity support if necessary under our commercial paper program discussed above. 
 As of September 30, 2024, The Cigna Group's revolving credit agreements include: a 5.0 billion five-year revolving credit and letter of credit agreement that expires in April 2029; and a 1.5 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement that expires in April 2025. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 6.5 billion of undrawn committed capacity under our revolving credit agreements (these amounts are available for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity support for our commercial paper program), 4.9 billion of remaining capacity under our commercial paper program and 6.0 billion in cash and short-term investments, approximately 0.5 billion of which was held by the parent company or certain non-regulated subsidiaries. 
 See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our credit agreements and commercial paper program. 
 Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 43.8 at September 30, 2024 and 43.6 at June 30, 2024. 
 We actively monitor our debt obligations and engage in issuance or redemption activities as needed in accordance with our capital management strategy. 
 Subsidiary Borrowings. In addition to the sources of liquidity discussed above, the parent company can borrow an additional 1.4 billion from its subsidiaries without further approvals as of September 30, 2024. 
 Use of Capital Resources 
 Debt Issuance and Debt Tender Offers. In February 2024, we issued 4.5 billion of new senior notes. The proceeds from this debt were used to complete the repurchase of a total of 1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of existing senior notes tendered to the Company pursuant to cash tender offers. We used the remaining net proceeds to fund the repayment of our senior notes which matured in March 2024 and for general corporate purposes, which includes repayment of indebtedness and repurchases of shares of our common stock. 
 
 Capital Expenditures . Capital expenditures for property, equipment and computer software were 1.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.2 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Anticipated capital expenditures will be funded primarily from operating cash flows. 
 Dividends . The Cigna Group declared and paid quarterly cash dividends of 1.40 per share of its common stock during the first nine months of 2024, compared to quarterly cash dividends of 1.23 per share during the first nine months of 2023. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our dividend payments. On October 23, 2024, the Board of Directors declared the fourth quarter cash dividend of 1.40 per share of The Cigna Group common stock to be paid on December 19, 2024 to shareholders of record on December 4, 2024. The Cigna Group currently intends to pay regular quarterly dividends, with future declarations subject to approval by its Board of Directors and the Board's determination that the declaration of dividends remains in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The decision of whether to pay future dividends and the amount of any such dividends will be based on the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements, the requirements of applicable law and any other factors the Board may deem relevant. 
 44 

Share Repurchases . We maintain a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, general business and market conditions and alternate uses of capital. The share repurchase program may be effected through open market purchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or privately negotiated transactions. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
 In February 2024, as part of our share repurchase program, we entered into separate Accelerated Share Repurchase ("ASR") agreements to repurchase 3.2 billion of common stock in aggregate. The total number of shares of our common stock repurchased under the agreements was approximately 9.3 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our ASR agreements. 
 Including the ASR agreements, we repurchased 14.7 million shares for approximately 5.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.1 million shares for approximately 1.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. From October 1, 2024 through October 30, 2024, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for approximately 715 million. Share repurchase authority was 5.6 billion as of October 30, 2024. 
 
 Other Sources of Funds and Uses of Capital Resources 
 
 Divestiture. In January 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Plans, Medicare and Other Supplemental Benefits and CareAllies businesses within the U.S. Healthcare operating segment to HCSC, subject to applicable regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025 and provide approximately 3.7 billion in transaction value, which consists primarily of the purchase price cash subject to adjustments to align with the final balance sheet of the divested businesses. Following the completion of the sale, we anticipate use of the proceeds in alignment with our capital deployment priorities, with the majority allocated to share repurchases. 
 
 Risks to Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Risks to our liquidity and capital resources outlook include cash projections that may not be realized and the demand for funds could exceed available cash if our ongoing businesses experience unexpected shortfalls in earnings or we experience material adverse effects from one or more risks or uncertainties described more fully in the "Risk Factors" section of our 2023 Form 10-K. Though we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity, significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could affect our ability to access those markets for additional borrowings or increase costs. 
 
 Guarantees and Contractual Obligations 
 We are contingently liable for various contractual obligations and financial and other guarantees entered into in the ordinary course of business. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of various guarantees. 
 
 Due to the issuance and repurchase of certain senior notes in the three months ended March 31, 2024, we have updated long-term debt obligations as of September 30, 2024 compared to those previously provided in our 2023 Form 10-K. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of these debt activities. There have been no material changes to other information presented in our guarantees and contractual obligations set forth in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 On balance sheet : 
 Long-term debt 
 Total scheduled payments on long-term debt are 48.8 billion through February 2054, which include scheduled interest payments and maturities of long-term debt. 
 We expect 0.3 billion of long-term debt payments (including scheduled interest payments) to be paid for the remainder of 2024. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: 
 it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and 
 45 

changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 
 Management has discussed how critical accounting estimates are developed and selected with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures presented in our 2023 Form 10-K. We regularly evaluate items that may impact critical accounting estimates. 

Our most critical accounting estimates, as well as the effect of hypothetical changes in material assumptions used to develop each estimate, are described in our 2023 Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates from what was reported in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Goodwill and Other intangible assets 
 Our annual evaluations of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairments were completed during the third quarter of 2024. These evaluations were performed at the reporting unit level, based on discounted cash flow analyses or market data. The estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by substantial margins. 
 
 Management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience significantly differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition. 

SEGMENT REPORTING 
 The following section of this MD A discusses the results of each of our segments. 
 See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of our segments. 
 In segment discussions, we present "adjusted revenues" and "pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations," defined as income (loss) before income taxes excluding pre-tax income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net realized investment results, amortization of acquired intangible assets and special items. The Company uses "pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations" and "adjusted revenues" as its principal financial measures of segment operating performance because management believes these metrics reflect the underlying results of business operations and facilitate analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and profitability. The Cigna Group's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded. Special items are matters that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to their nature or size. Ratios presented in this segment discussion exclude the same items as adjusted revenues and pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of these metrics and a reconciliation of income (loss) before income taxes to pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations, as well as a reconciliation of Total revenues to adjusted revenues. Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements also explains that segment revenues include both external revenues and sales between segments that are eliminated in Corporate. 
 In these segment discussions, we also present "pre-tax adjusted margin," defined as pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations divided by adjusted revenues. 
 
 Evernorth Health Services Segment 
 Evernorth Health Services includes a broad range of coordinated and point solution health services and capabilities, as well as those from partners across the health care system, within our Pharmacy Benefit Services and Specialty and Care Services operating segments. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these two operating segments. As described in the introduction to Segment Reporting, Evernorth Health Services' performance is measured using adjusted revenues and pre-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Segment Performance 
 
 The key factors that impact Evernorth Health Services' Pharmacy Benefit Services and Specialty and Care Services revenues and income from operations are volume, mix of claims, price and contract affordability services. Specialty and Care Services revenue is also impacted by specialty distribution customer growth and client growth. These key factors are discussed further below. Certain of the key factors impact both operating segments as services are offered through an integrated client contract. See Note 2 to the 
 46 

Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on revenue and cost recognition policies for this segment. 
 
 Key Factors that impact both Pharmacy Benefit Services and Specialty and Care Services: 
 Pharmacy claim volume (also referred to as utilization) relates to processing prescription claims filled by retail pharmacies in our network and from dispensing prescription claims from our home delivery and specialty pharmacies and other claims. As pharmacy prescription claim volumes increase or decrease due to customer utilization, organic customer growth through the expansion of existing clients or new clients, our gross profit and income from operations correspondingly increase or decrease. 
 The mix of claims generally considers the type of drug and distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling. In addition to the types of drugs, the mix of generic or biosimilar claims also impacts our results. Generally, a higher mix of generic and biosimilar drugs reduces revenues, as generic and biosimilar drugs are typically priced lower than the branded drugs they replace. However, as ingredient cost paid to pharmacies on generic and biosimilar drugs is incrementally lower than the price charged to our clients, a higher mix of generic and biosimilar drugs generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit and income from operations. 
 Pharmaceutical manufacturer inflation also impacts our pricing because most of our contracts provide that we bill clients and pay pharmacies based on a generally recognized price index for pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the rate of inflation for prescription drugs and our efforts to manage this inflation for our clients continues to be a significant driver of our revenues and cost of revenues in the current environment. 
 Our client contract pricing is impacted by our ongoing ability to negotiate favorable contracts for pharmacy network, pharmaceutical and wholesaler purchasing and manufacturer rebates on our clients' behalf (also referred to as affordability improvements). Through these affordability services, we seek to improve the effectiveness of our integrated and fee-for-service solutions, for the benefit of our new and existing clients, by continuously innovating, improving affordability and implementing drug purchasing contract initiatives. Our continued affordability improvements further reduce drug costs for the benefit of our consumers and clients and we share in the value delivered, which generally results in a favorable impact on our gross profit and income from operations. 
 
 Key factors that impact Specialty and Care Services: 
 Customer growth generally results in increased revenues and income from operations. This generally includes both organic customer growth through the expansion of existing business and new business, as well as higher volume in our specialty distribution services where we deliver pharmaceuticals and medical supplies directly to health care providers, clinics and hospitals, primarily to physicians who regularly order costly specialty pharmaceuticals. This business provides competitive pricing on pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and leverages our distribution platform to improve our results. 
 Client growth, both organic and new business, in our Care Delivery and Management Solutions business generally results in increased revenues and income from operations. This includes client movement in our virtual care, in-home care, physical primary care, benefits management, and behavioral health services, as we expand our businesses and build upon our cross-enterprise leverage. 
 
 In this MD A, we present our segment performance measures adjusted revenues and pre-tax adjusted income from operations. We also present adjusted gross profit, which is calculated as adjusted revenues less Pharmacy and other service costs (which is inclusive of all costs of revenue). We utilize adjusted revenues in this calculation, consistent with our reporting measure that excludes special items, as this reflects the underlying results of business operations.

 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Commentary in parentheses regarding percentage changes represents the driver's impact on the overall category. 
 
 Adjusted revenues increased 36 and 31 , primarily reflecting higher utilization of prescription drugs from customer growth in both Pharmacy Benefit Services and Specialty and Care Services. 
 
 Adjusted gross profit increased 11 for both periods, primarily reflecting relatively equal contributions from customer growth in Specialty and Care Services and continued affordability improvements in Pharmacy Benefit Services. 
 
 48 

Pre-tax adjusted income from operations increased 9 and 7 , primarily reflecting customer growth in Specialty and Care Services (+11 and +10 and continued affordability improvements in Pharmacy Benefit Services (+3 in both periods). This increase was partially offset by strategic investments to support business growth and continued advancement of our capabilities and solutions (-2 and -4 in Specialty and Care Services and -2 in both periods in Pharmacy Benefit Services). 
 
 The adjusted SG A expense ratio decreased 50 bps and 30 bps, primarily reflecting higher adjusted revenues as discussed above. 

Cigna Healthcare Segment 
 Cigna Healthcare includes the U.S. Healthcare and International Health businesses, which provide comprehensive medical and coordinated solutions to clients and customers. As described in the introduction to Segment Reporting, performance of the Cigna Healthcare segment is measured using adjusted revenues and pre-tax adjusted income from operations. 
 In January 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Plans, Medicare and Other Supplemental Benefits and CareAllies businesses within the U.S. Healthcare operating segment to HCSC, subject to applicable regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 Key Factors Affecting Segment Performance 
 
 Key factors affecting results for this segment include: 
 customer growth; 
 revenue growth, including increases to premium rates in consideration of anticipated medical costs (also referred to as premium rate increases); 
 medical cost trend (also referred to as higher medical costs), which is impacted by utilization (the quantity of medical services consumed by our customers), unit costs (the cost per medical service) and mix of services; 
 percentage of Medicare Advantage customers in plans eligible for quality bonus payments; 
 medical costs as a percentage of premiums (medical care ratio or "MCR") for our insured businesses, which includes affordability initiatives that serve to mitigate medical cost inflation; and 
 selling, general and administrative expenses excluding special items as a percentage of adjusted revenues (which we refer to as adjusted SG A expense ratio).

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Commentary regarding percentage changes (or bps) and dollar variances represents the driver's impact on overall category. 
 Adjusted revenues increased 3 and 4 , primarily due to higher premiums within employer insured (+ 238 million and + 810 million), Medicare Part D (+ 202 million and + 410 million) and stop loss (+ 141 million and + 457 million), in each case reflecting premium rate increases to cover expected increases in underlying medical costs, partially offset by lower premiums within Individual and Family Plans (- 268 million and - 754 million), reflecting a decrease in customers. 
 Pre-tax adjusted income from operations decreased 4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher medical costs (- 569 million), partially offset by higher adjusted revenues (+ 395 million) and lower selling, general and administrative expenses excluding special items (+ 126 million), primarily reflecting ongoing efficiencies. Pre-tax adjusted income from operations increased 6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher adjusted revenues (+ 1.4 billion) and lower selling, general and administrative expenses excluding special items (+ 155 million), primarily reflecting ongoing efficiencies, partially offset by higher medical costs (- 1.3 billion). The impact of higher premiums in adjusted revenues and medical costs are reflected in the medical care ratio calculation. 
 The medical care ratio increased 230 bps for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a higher U.S. Healthcare medical care ratio, reflecting relatively equal contributions from business mix and one additional business day in the third quarter of 2024. The medical care ratio increased 70 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a higher U.S. Healthcare medical care ratio driven by business mix. 
 The adjusted SG A expense ratio decreased 160 bps and 110 bps, primarily due to revenue growth outpacing volume-related expenses (-80 bps and -60 bps) and ongoing efficiencies (-60 bps and -30 bps). 

Medical Customers 
 A medical customer is defined as a person meeting any one of the following criteria: 
 is covered under a medical insurance policy, managed care arrangement or administrative services agreement issued by us; 
 has access to our provider network for covered services under their medical plan; or

Our unpaid claims and claim expenses liability was flat, driven by a decrease in Individual and Family Plans customers (- 290 million), mostly offset by stop loss seasonality (+ 175 million) and Medicare Advantage (+ 80 million). 

Other Operations 
 Other Operations includes corporate owned life insurance ("COLI"), the Company's run-off operations and other non-strategic businesses. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these operations. As described in the introduction of Segment Reporting, performance of Other Operations is measured using adjusted revenues and pre-tax adjusted income from operations.

INVESTMENT ASSETS 
 The following table presents our investment asset portfolio excluding separate account assets. Additional information regarding our investment assets is included in Notes 11, 12, 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (In millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Debt securities 9,881 9,855 Equity securities 517 3,362 Commercial mortgage loans 1,460 1,533 Policy loans 1,163 1,211 Other long-term investments 4,545 4,181 Short-term investments 182 206 Total 17,748 20,348 Investments classified as assets of businesses held for sale (1) 
 (1,614) (1,438) Investments per Consolidated Balance Sheets 16,134 18,910 
 (1) Investments related to the HCSC transaction that were held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These investments were primarily comprised of debt securities and commercial mortgage loans, and to a lesser extent, other long-term investments. 
 
 Investment Outlook 
 Although impacts to our core insurance and operating business portfolios have been limited to date, we continue to actively monitor geopolitical events and economic conditions and their potential impact on the investment portfolio, including expectations for inflation and interest rates, the potential for a recession, and ongoing conflict in Europe and the Middle East. Future realized and unrealized investment results will be driven largely by market conditions and these future conditions are not reasonably predictable. We believe that the vast majority of our investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms. We manage the portfolio for long-term economics and therefore we expect to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term. Although future declines in investment fair values remain possible due to interest rate movements and credit deterioration due to both investment-specific uncertainties and global economic uncertainties as discussed below, we do not expect these losses to have a material unfavorable effect on our financial condition or liquidity. The following discussion addresses the strategies and risks associated with our various classes of investment assets. 
 
 Debt Securities 
 Investments in debt securities include publicly traded and privately placed bonds, mortgage and other asset-backed securities and preferred stocks redeemable by the investor. These investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additional information regarding valuation methodologies, key inputs and controls is included in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The following table reflects our portfolio of debt securities by type of issuer: (In millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Federal government and agency 289 267 State and local government 38 38 Foreign government 376 352 Corporate 
 8,825 8,833 Mortgage and other asset-backed 353 365 Total 9,881 9,855 
 
 The carrying value of our debt securities portfolio slightly increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting a valuation increase due to a decline of market interest rates, offset by net sales activity . Our portfolio remains in a net unrealized depreciation position due to generally increasing interest rates over the past few years. More detailed information about debt securities by type of issuer, maturity dates and net unrealized position is included in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 8.6 billion, or 86 , of the debt securities in our investment portfolio were investment grade (Baa and above, or equivalent) and the remaining 1.3 billion were below investment grade. The majority of the bonds that are below investment grade were rated at the higher end of the non-investment grade spectrum. These quality characteristics have not materially changed since the prior year and remain consistent with our investment strategy. 
 52 

Debt securities include private placement assets of 3.9 billion. These investments are generally less marketable than publicly traded bonds; however, yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly traded bonds with comparable credit risk. We perform a credit analysis of each issuer and require financial and other covenants that allow us to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength and pursue remedial actions, if warranted. 
 Investments in debt securities are diversified by issuer, geography and industry. On an aggregate basis, the debt securities portfolio continues to perform according to original expectations, which includes a long-term economic investment strategy. Primary risks facing many of the issuers in our portfolio include on-going geopolitical events and economic conditions, including expectations for a longer period of higher inflation and interest rates. To date, most issuers have been successful in managing these issues without a meaningful change in credit quality. We continue to monitor the economic environment and its effect on our portfolio and consider the impact of various factors in determining the allowance for credit losses on debt securities, which is discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Commercial Mortgage Loans 
 As of September 30, 2024, our 1.5 billion commercial mortgage loan portfolio consisted of approximately 45 fixed-rate loans, diversified by property type, location and borrower. These loans are carried in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their unpaid principal balance, net of an allowance for expected credit losses. As a result of increasing market interest rates since the majority of these loans were made, the carrying value exceeds the market value of these loans as of September 30, 2024. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate, positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash invested in the property generally ranging between 30 and 40 , we remain confident that the vast majority of borrowers will continue to perform as expected under their contract terms. For further discussion of the results and changes in key loan metrics, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Loans are secured by high quality commercial properties, located in strong institutional markets and are generally made at approximately 60 of the property's value at origination of the loan. Property value, debt service coverage, quality, building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations. We hold no direct residential mortgage loans and do not originate or service securitized mortgage loans. 
 We assess the credit quality of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio annually, generally in the second quarter by reviewing each holding's most recent financial statements, rent rolls, budgets and relevant market reports. The review performed in the second quarter of 2024 confirmed ongoing strong overall credit quality in line with the previous year's results. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our key credit quality indicators for commercial mortgage loans. 
 Office sector fundamentals have been and continue to be weak and values are experiencing stress due to multiple headwinds: expanded work from home flexibility, shorter term leases, elevated tenant improvement allowances and corporate migration to lower cost states. Additionally, the current macroeconomic headwinds are impacting capital markets and reducing investor appetite for capital intensive assets (e.g., offices and regional shopping malls). Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio has no exposure to regional shopping malls and less than 25 exposure to office properties. Although future losses remain possible due to further credit deterioration, we do not expect these losses to have a material unfavorable effect on our financial condition or liquidity. 
 Other Long-term Investments 
 Other long-term investments of 4.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 included investments in securities limited partnerships and real estate limited partnerships, direct investments in real estate joint ventures and other deposit activity that is required to support various insurance and health services businesses. Accounting policies for these investments are discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These limited partnership entities typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately-held companies and equity real estate. Given our subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities, we assume a higher level of risk for higher expected returns. To mitigate risk, these investments are diversified across approximately 220 separate partnerships and 110 general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships. Also, the underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type and geographic region. No single partnership investment exceeded 3 of our securities and real estate limited partnership portfolio. 
 Income from our limited partnership investments is generally reported on a one quarter lag due to the timing of when financial information is received from the general partner or manager of the investments. We expect continued volatility in private equity and real estate fund performance going forward as fair market valuations are adjusted to reflect market and portfolio transactions. Less than 4 of our other long-term investments are exposed to real estate in the office sector. 
 
 We participate in an insurance joint venture in China with a 50 ownership interest. We account for this joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Our 50 share of the investment portfolio supporting the joint venture's liabilities is approximately 15.1 
 53 

billion as of September 30, 2024. These investments were comprised of approximately 75 debt securities, including government and corporate debt diversified by issuer, industry and geography; 15 equities, including mutual funds, equity securities and private equity partnerships; and 10 long-term deposits and policy loans. We continuously review the joint venture's investment strategy and its execution. There were no investments with a material unrealized loss as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 MARKET RISK 
 Financial Instruments 
 Our assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and equity price risk. We encourage you to read this in conjunction with "Market Risk Financial Instruments" included in the MD A section of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was an increase in our interest rate risk due to an increase in the fair value of our long-term debt since December 31, 2023. In the event of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt would decrease approximately 2.1 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 1.8 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 If the market price for all equity securities declined by 10 , the fair value of the Company's equity securities would decrease by approximately 0.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 0.3 billion at December 31, 2023. This decline in our equity price risk exposure is driven by the impairment of equity securities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the impairment in equity securities.

 Information responsive to this item is contained under the caption "Market Risk" in Item 2 above, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of The Cigna Group's disclosure controls and procedures conducted under the supervision and with the participation of The Cigna Group's management (including The Cigna Group's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer), The Cigna Group's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, The Cigna Group's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by The Cigna Group in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to The Cigna Group's management (including The Cigna Group's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The Cigna Group is in the process of a multi-year enterprise resource planning system implementation to increase efficiency and modernize the tools and technology used in certain financial close and reporting processes. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, certain subsidiaries completed the initial phase of this implementation. 
 In conjunction with this implementation, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, certain internal controls over financial reporting have been added or modified to accommodate related changes in the Company's systems and business processes. There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, The Cigna Group's internal control over financial reporting. As additional phases of the implementation occur, we will continue to monitor and modify, as needed, the design and operating effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
