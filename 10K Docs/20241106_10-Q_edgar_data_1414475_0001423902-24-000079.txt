 OUTLOOK 
 
 We expect our business to be affected by the below - described key trends and uncertainties. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from expected results. 
 
 Impact of producer activity. Our business is primarily driven by the level of production of crude oil and natural gas by producers in our areas of operation. This activity, however, can be impacted negatively by, among other things, commodity-price fluctuations and operational challenges. Fluctuating crude - oil, natural - gas, and NGLs prices can reduce the level of our customers activities and change the allocation of capital within their own asset portfolios. Such fluctuations can also impact us directly to the extent we take ownership of and sell certain volumes at the tailgate of our plants for our own account. The New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude - oil daily settlement prices during 2023 ranged from a low of 66.74 per barrel in March 2023 to a high of 93.68 per barrel in September 2023, and prices during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, ranged from a low of 65.75 per barrel in September 2024 to a high of 86.91 per barrel in April 2024. The Waha Hub natural gas price during 2023 ranged from a low of 3.8400) per MMBtu in January 2023 to a high of 3.2750 per MMBtu in January 2023, and prices during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, ranged from a low of 6.2250) per MMBtu in August 2024 to a high of 8.2650 per MMBtu in January 2024. The extent and duration of commodity - price volatility, and the associated direct and indirect impact on our business, cannot be predicted. To address the risks posed by fluctuating commodity prices, we intend to continue evaluating the relevant price environments and adjust our capital spending plans to reflect our customers anticipated activity levels, while maintaining appropriate liquidity and financial flexibility. 
 Additionally, even when the commodity-price environments are favorable, our customers must manage numerous operational challenges, including severe weather disruptions, downstream and produced-water takeaway constraints, seismicity concerns, new regulatory requirements, and the ability to optimize the efficiency and results of large, complex drilling programs. Our producers ability to mitigate or manage such challenges can have a significant impact on the volumes available for us to service in the short term. For this reason, we strive to work proactively with our customers whenever possible to provide high levels of reliability on our systems and help them meet these operational challenges as they arise. 
 
 Impact of inflation and supply-chain disruptions. Although somewhat abated during 2024, the U.S. economy has recently experienced significant inflation relative to historical precedent. Inflation has raised our costs for steel products, automation components, power supply, labor, materials, fuel, and services, which has increased our operating costs and capital expenditures. Any increases in inflationary pressure could materially and negatively impact our financial results. To the extent permitted by regulations and escalation provisions in certain of our existing agreements, we have the ability to recover a portion of increased costs in the form of higher fees. 
 
 Impact of interest rates. Short- and long-term interest rates can be volatile, resulting in immediate changes to interest expense on RCF borrowings and commercial paper borrowings. Any future increases in interest rates likely will result in additional increases in financing costs. As with other yield-oriented securities, our unit price could be impacted by our implied distribution yield relative to market interest rates. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units, and a rising interest-rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity, or increase the cost of issuing equity, to make acquisitions, to reduce debt, or for other purposes. However, we expect our cost of capital to remain competitive, as our peers face similar interest-rate dynamics.

 ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 
 
 Marcellus Interest systems. During the second quarter of 2024, we closed on the sale of our 33.75 interest in the Marcellus Interest systems for proceeds of 206.2 million, resulting in a net gain on sale of 63.9 million that was recorded as Gain (loss) on divestiture and other, net in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 Mont Belvieu JV, Whitethorn LLC, Panola, and Saddlehorn. During the first quarter of 2024, we closed on the sale of the following equity investments to third parties: (i) the 25.00 interest in Mont Belvieu JV, (ii) the 20.00 interest in Whitethorn LLC, (iii) the 15.00 interest in Panola, and (iv) the 20.00 interest in Saddlehorn. The combined proceeds received in the first quarter of 2024 of 588.6 million includes 5.9 million in pro-rata distributions through closing, resulting in a net gain on sale of 239.7 million that was recorded as Gain (loss) on divestiture and other, net in the consolidated statement of operations. The sale of the interests in Mont Belvieu JV and Whitethorn LLC also resolved outstanding legal proceedings associated with those assets. 
 
 Meritage. In October 2023, we closed on the acquisition of Meritage for 885.0 million (subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments) funded with cash, including proceeds from our 600.0 million senior note issuance in September 2023 and borrowings on the RCF.

 Natural-gas assets 
 Total throughput attributable to WES for natural - gas assets increased by 28 MMcf/d for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher volumes at the Powder River Basin, West Texas, and Chipeta complexes due to increased production in the areas. These increases were offset partially by (i) lower volumes at the DJ Basin complex due to decreased production in the area and scheduled plant maintenance during the third quarter of 2024, (ii) lower volumes at the MIGC system due to certain temporary customer constraints, (iii) lower volumes at the Marcellus Interest systems due to the sale of the asset during the second quarter of 2024, and (iv) lower volumes at the Springfield gas-gathering system and Mi Vida plant. 
 Total throughput attributable to WES for natural - gas assets increased by 715 MMcf/d for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) higher volumes at the Powder River Basin complex due to the Meritage acquisition, (ii) higher volumes at the West Texas and DJ Basin complexes due to increased production in the areas, (iii) higher volumes at the Red Bluff Express pipeline due to the addition of a new receipt point into the pipeline, (iv) higher volumes at the Springfield gas-gathering system due to new third-party production, and (v) higher volumes at the Brasada plant. These increases were offset partially by (i) lower volumes at the Granger complex due to a contract expiration in the fourth quarter of 2023 and (ii) lower volumes at the Marcellus Interest systems due to the sale of the asset during the second quarter of 2024.

 Crude-oil and NGLs assets 
 Total throughput attributable to WES for crude - oil and NGLs assets decreased by 9 MBbls/d for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) lower volumes at the DJ Basin oil system due to production declines in the surrounding areas, (ii) the divestiture of Wamsutter in the third quarter of 2024, and (iii) decreased volumes on the White Cliffs pipeline. These decreases were offset partially by higher volumes at the DBM oil system due to increased production in the area. 
 Total throughput attributable to WES for crude - oil and NGLs assets decreased by 106 MBbls/d for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the divestiture of Whitethorn LLC, Mont Belvieu JV, and Saddlehorn in the first quarter of 2024. These decreases were offset partially by (i) higher volumes at the DBM and DJ Basin oil systems due to increased production in the area and (ii) higher volumes at the Thunder Creek NGL pipeline, which was acquired as part of the Meritage acquisition. 
 
 Produced-water assets 
 Total throughput attributable to WES for produced - water assets increased by 19 MBbls/d and 108 MBbls/d for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to higher production.

 We are not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes; therefore, our federal statutory rate is zero percent. However, income apportionable to Texas is subject to Texas margin tax. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the variance from the federal statutory rate was primarily impacted by a state margin tax rate increase associated with no longer being included in Occidental s affiliated group tax return beginning in September 2024 due to Occidental s sale of 19.5 million WES common units in August 2024 and the resulting decrease in WES ownership, inclusive of its ownership in WES Operating.

 RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 Adjusted gross margin. We define Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Midstream Partners, LP Adjusted gross margin as total revenues and other (less reimbursements for electricity - related expenses recorded as revenue), less cost of product, plus distributions from equity investments, and excluding the noncontrolling interest owners proportionate share of revenues and cost of product. We believe Adjusted gross margin is an important performance measure of our operations profitability and performance as compared to other companies in the midstream industry. Cost of product expenses include (i) costs associated with the purchase of natural gas and NGLs pursuant to our percent - of - proceeds, percent - of - product, and keep - whole contracts, (ii) costs associated with the valuation of gas and NGLs imbalances, (iii) costs associated with our obligations under certain contracts to redeliver a volume of natural gas to shippers, which is thermally equivalent to condensate retained by us and sold to third parties, and (iv) costs associated with our offload commitments with third parties providing firm-processing capacity. The electricity-related expenses included in our Adjusted gross margin definition relate to pass-through expenses that are recorded as Operation and maintenance expense with an offset recorded as revenue for the reimbursement by certain customers. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Western Midstream Partners, LP Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus (i) distributions from equity investments, (ii) non - cash equity - based compensation expense, (iii) interest expense, (iv) income tax expense, (v) depreciation and amortization, (vi) impairments, and (vii) other expense (including lower of cost or market inventory adjustments recorded in cost of product), less (i) gain (loss) on divestiture and other, net, (ii) gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt, (iii) income from equity investments, (iv) interest income, (v) income tax benefit, (vi) other income, and (vii) the noncontrolling interest owners proportionate share of revenues and expenses. We believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and make distributions. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, commercial banks, and rating agencies, use, among other measures, to assess the following: 
 our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream industry, without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis; 
 the ability of our assets to generate cash flow to make distributions; and 
 the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditures and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. 
 
 Free cash flow. We define Free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less total capital expenditures and contributions to equity investments, plus distributions from equity investments in excess of cumulative earnings. Management considers Free cash flow an appropriate metric for assessing capital discipline, cost efficiency, and balance - sheet strength. Although Free cash flow is the metric used to assess our ability to make distributions to unitholders, this measure should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that is available for distributions or planned for distributions for a given period. Instead, Free cash flow represents the amount of cash that is available in aggregate for distributions, debt repayments, and other general partnership purposes.

 Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free cash flow are not defined in GAAP. The GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to Adjusted gross margin is gross margin. Net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities are the GAAP measures that are most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. The GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to Free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. Our non - GAAP financial measures of Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to the GAAP measures of gross margin, net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect gross margin, net income (loss), and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our definitions of Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry, thereby diminishing their utility as comparative measures. 
 Management compensates for the limitations of Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free cash flow as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free cash flow compared to (as applicable) gross margin, net income (loss), and net cash provided by operating activities, and incorporating this knowledge into its decision - making processes. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management considers in evaluating our operating results. 
 The following tables present (i) a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of gross margin to the non - GAAP financial measure of Adjusted gross margin, (ii) a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measures of net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities to the non - GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, and (iii) a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of net cash provided by operating activities to the non - GAAP financial measure of Free cash flow:

Calculated as Adjusted gross margin for natural - gas assets, crude - oil and NGLs assets, or produced - water assets, divided by the respective total throughput (MMcf or MBbls) attributable to WES for natural - gas assets, crude - oil and NGLs assets, or produced - water assets. 
 
 Adjusted gross margin. Adjusted gross margin decreased by 8.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) lower average prices and decreased product recoveries, partially offset by increased throughput at the West Texas complex, and (ii) a decrease in distributions from FRP. These decreases were offset partially by increased throughput at the DBM oil system. 
 Adjusted gross margin increased by 363.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) increased throughput at the Powder River Basin complex attributable to the acquisition of Meritage, (ii) increased throughput and a higher average fee resulting from a cost-of-service rate redetermination effective January 1, 2024, at the West Texas complex, DBM water systems, and DBM oil system, and (iii) increased throughput at the DJ Basin complex. These increases were offset partially by (i) decreased distributions from TEP, (ii) the sale of our interests in the Mont Belvieu JV, Marcellus Interest systems, and Saddlehorn during 2024, and (iii) decreased processing fees at the Brasada complex resulting from a change in contract terms effective July 1, 2023, partially offset by increased throughput. 
 Per - Mcf Adjusted gross margin for natural - gas assets decreased by 0.04 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) decreased product recoveries and average prices, partially offset by increased throughput at the West Texas complex, which has a higher-than-average per-Mcf margin as compared to our other natural-gas assets, and (ii) increased throughput at the Powder River Basin complex, which has a lower-than-average per-Mcf margin as compared to our other natural-gas assets. 
 Per - Mcf Adjusted gross margin for natural - gas assets increased by 0.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) increased throughput at the West Texas complex, which has a higher-than-average per-Mcf margin as compared to our other natural-gas assets, in addition to a higher average fee resulting from a cost-of-service rate redetermination effective January 1, 2024, and increased deficiency fees on certain contracts with increasing throughput minimums, and (ii) increased throughput at the DJ Basin complex, which has a higher-than-average per-Mcf margin as compared to our other natural-gas assets. 
 Per - Bbl Adjusted gross margin for crude - oil and NGLs assets decreased by 0.08 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to decreased distributions at FRP and TEP, partially offset by increased throughput at the DBM oil system, which has a higher-than-average per-Mcf margin as compared to our other crude-oil and NGLs assets. 
 Per - Bbl Adjusted gross margin for crude - oil and NGLs assets increased by 0.43 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) the sale of our interests in the Mont Belvieu JV, Saddlehorn, and Whitethorn LLC in the first quarter of 2024, all of which had lower-than-average per-Bbl margins as compared to our other crude-oil and NGLs assets, and (ii) increased throughput at the DBM oil system, which has a higher-than-average per-Mcf margin as compared to our other crude-oil and NGLs assets, in addition to a higher average fee resulting from a cost-of-service rate redetermination effective January 1, 2024. These increases were offset partially by (i) decreased distributions at TEP and (ii) decreased revenues associated with demand volumes at the DJ Basin oil system. 
 Per - Bbl Adjusted gross margin for produced - water assets increased by 0.13 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher throughput and a higher average fee resulting from a cost-of-service rate redetermination effective January 1, 2024.

 Free cash flow. Free cash flow decreased by 59.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to (i) an 80.1 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and (ii) a 2.0 million decrease in distributions from equity investments in excess of cumulative earnings. These decreases were offset partially by a 22.4 million decrease in capital expenditures. 
 Free cash flow increased by 332.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a 394.4 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by (i) a 58.7 million increase in capital expenditures and (ii) a 4.2 million decrease in distributions from equity investments in excess of cumulative earnings. 
 See Capital Expenditures and Historical Cash Flow within this Item 2 for further information.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our primary cash uses include equity and debt service, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. Our sources of liquidity, as of September 30, 2024, included cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from operations, effective borrowing capacity under the RCF, our commercial paper program, and potential issuances of additional equity or debt securities. We believe that cash flows generated from these sources will be sufficient to satisfy our short - term working-capital requirements and long - term capital - expenditure and debt-service requirements. 
 The amount of future distributions to unitholders will be determined by the Board on a quarterly basis. Under our partnership agreement, we distribute all of our available cash (beyond proper reserves as defined in our partnership agreement) within 55 days following each quarter s end. Our cash flow and resulting ability to make cash distributions are dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from operations. Generally, our available cash is our cash on hand at the end of a quarter after the payment of our expenses and the establishment of cash reserves, and cash on hand resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter. The general partner establishes cash reserves to provide for the proper conduct of our business, including (i) to fund future capital expenditures, (ii) to comply with applicable laws, debt instruments, or other agreements, or (iii) to provide funds for unitholder distributions for any one or more of the next four quarters. The Board declared a cash distribution to unitholders for the third quarter of 2024 of 0.875 per unit, or 340.9 million in the aggregate. The cash distribution is payable on November 14, 2024, to our unitholders of record at the close of business on November 1, 2024. 
 To facilitate the distribution of available cash, during 2022 we adopted a financial policy that provided for an additional distribution Enhanced Distribution to be paid in conjunction with the regular first-quarter distribution of the following year (beginning in 2023), in a target amount equal to Free cash flow generated in the prior year after subtracting Free cash flow used for the prior year s debt repayments, regular-quarter distributions, and unit repurchases. This Enhanced Distribution is subject to Board discretion, the establishment of cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business, and is also contingent on the attainment of prior year-end net leverage thresholds (the ratio of our total principal debt outstanding less total cash on hand as of the end of such period, as compared to our trailing-twelve-months Adjusted EBITDA) after taking the Enhanced Distribution for such prior year into effect. Free cash flow and Adjusted EBITDA are defined under the caption Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this Item 2. 
 In 2022, we announced a common-unit buyback program of up to 1.25 billion through December 31, 2024. The common units may be purchased from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of purchases under the program will be determined based on ongoing assessments of capital needs, our financial performance, the market price of our common units, and other factors, including organic growth and acquisition opportunities and general market conditions. The program does not obligate us to purchase any specific dollar amount or number of units and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no common units repurchased. As of September 30, 2024, we had an authorized amount of 627.8 million remaining under the program. 
 Management continuously monitors our leverage position and other financial projections to manage the capital structure according to long-term objectives. We may, from time to time, seek to retire, rearrange, or amend some or all of our outstanding debt or financing agreements through cash purchases, exchanges, open - market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity position and requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material. Our ability to generate cash flows is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Read Risk Factors under Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q.

 Working capital . Working capital is an indication of liquidity and potential needs for short - term funding. Working capital requirements are driven by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable and other factors such as credit extended to, and the timing of collections from, our customers, and the level and timing of our spending for acquisitions, maintenance, and other capital activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had a 186.5 million working capital surplus, which we define as the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, there was 2.0 billion in effective borrowing capacity under the RCF. Any outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce the effective borrowing capacity under the RCF as WES Operating maintains availability under the RCF as support for its commercial paper program. See Note 9 Selected Components of Working Capital and Note 10 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Capital expenditures . Our business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain and improve existing facilities or to develop new midstream infrastructure. Capital expenditures include maintenance capital expenditures, which include those expenditures required to maintain existing operating capacity and service capability of our assets, and expansion capital expenditures, which include expenditures to construct new midstream infrastructure and expenditures incurred to reduce costs, increase revenues, or increase system throughput or capacity from current levels. 
 Capital expenditures in the consolidated statements of cash flows reflect capital expenditures on a cash basis, when payments are made. Capital incurred is presented on an accrual basis. Acquisitions and capital expenditures as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows and capital incurred were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, thousands 2024 2023 Acquisitions 443 Capital expenditures (1) 
 595,087 536,427 Capital incurred (1) 
 623,985 566,224 
 _________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, included 11.1 million and 8.6 million, respectively, of capitalized interest. 
 
 Capital expenditures increased by 58.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increases of (i) 71.0 million at the West Texas complex, primarily attributable to engineering, equipment, and construction milestone payments for the North Loving Plant, (ii) 25.3 million at the Powder River Basin complex primarily attributable to the acquisition of Meritage, (iii) 8.9 million in corporate-level capital expenditures primarily related to information technology initiatives, (iv) 8.2 million at the DJ Basin complex due to the purchase of a field office in the first quarter of 2024 and an increase in well connection and pipeline projects, and (v) 7.5 million at the Chipeta complex primarily related to expansion projects. These increases were offset partially by decreases of (i) 41.8 million at the DBM oil system related to a decrease in pipeline, oil treating, and oil pumping projects and (ii) 18.5 million at the DBM water systems due to reduced construction of certain water - disposal wells, facilities, and well-connect projects.

 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily included the following: 
 845.0 million of repayments of outstanding borrowings under the RCF; 
 
 778.3 million of distributions paid to WES unitholders and noncontrolling interest owners; 
 
 259.8 million to purchase and retire portions of certain of WES Operating s senior notes via open-market repurchases;

 134.6 million of unit repurchases; 
 
 740.6 million of net proceeds from the 6.150 Senior Notes due 2033 issued in April 2023, which were used to repay borrowings under the RCF and for general partnership purposes; 
 
 595.1 million of net proceeds from the 6.350 Senior Notes due 2029 issued in September 2023, which were used to fund a portion of the aggregate purchase price for the Meritage acquisition, to pay related costs and expenses, and for general partnership purposes; and 
 
 470.0 million of borrowings under the RCF, which were used for general partnership purposes. 

Debt and credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of outstanding debt was 7.9 billion, and we have 2.0 billion in effective borrowing capacity under WES Operating s 2.0 billion RCF. Any outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce the effective borrowing capacity under the RCF as WES Operating maintains availability under the RCF as support for its commercial paper program. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, WES Operating (i) completed the public offering of 800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.450 Senior Notes due 2034, (ii) purchased and retired 150.0 million of certain of its senior notes via open-market repurchases with cash from operations, and (iii) entered into an amendment to the RCF to exercise an option to extend the maturity date of the RCF from April 2028 to April 2029, for each extending lender. As of September 30, 2024, the 3.100 Senior Notes due 2025 and 3.950 Senior Notes due 2025 were classified as short-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 For additional information on our senior notes, RCF, and commercial paper program, see Note 10 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Credit risk . We bear credit risk through exposure to non - payment or non - performance by our counterparties, including Occidental, financial institutions, customers, and other parties. Generally, non - payment or non - performance results from a customer s inability to satisfy payables to us for services rendered, minimum - volume - commitment deficiency payments owed, or volumes owed pursuant to gas- or NGLs-imbalance agreements. We examine and monitor the creditworthiness of customers and may establish credit limits for customers. We are subject to the risk of non - payment or late payment by producers for gathering, processing, transportation, and disposal fees. Additionally, we continue to evaluate counterparty credit risk and, in certain circumstances, are exercising our contractual rights to request adequate assurance of performance. 
 We expect our exposure to the concentrated risk of non - payment or non - performance to continue for as long as our commercial relationships with Occidental generate a significant portion of our revenues. While Occidental is our contracting counterparty, gathering and processing arrangements with affiliates of Occidental on most of our systems include not just Occidental - produced volumes, but also, in some instances, the volumes of other working - interest owners of Occidental who rely on our facilities and infrastructure to bring their volumes to market. See Note 6 Related-Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 Our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders may be adversely impacted if Occidental becomes unable to perform under the terms of gathering, processing, transportation, and disposal agreements.

See Note 4 Partnership Distributions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods reported. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 See Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Commodity-price risk. There have been no significant changes to our commodity-price risk discussion from the disclosure set forth under Part II, Item 7A in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as noted below and in Outlook under Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 95 of our wellhead natural - gas volume (excluding equity investments) and 100 of our crude - oil and produced - water throughput (excluding equity investments) were serviced under fee - based contracts. A 10 increase or decrease in commodity prices would not have a material impact on our operating income (loss), financial condition, or cash flows for the next 12 months, excluding the effect of imbalances. 
 
 Interest-rate risk. The Federal Open Market Committee increased its target range four times for the federal funds rate in 2023 and decreased its target range once during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Any future increases in the federal funds rate likely will result in an increase in financing costs. As of September 30, 2024, WES Operating had (i) no outstanding borrowings under the RCF that bear interest at a rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or an alternative base rate at WES Operating s option and (ii) no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. While a 10 change in the applicable benchmark interest rate would not materially impact interest expense on our outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024, it would impact the fair value of the senior notes. 
 Additional short-term or variable - rate debt may be issued in the future, either under the RCF or other financing sources, including commercial paper borrowings or debt issuances.

There were no changes in WES s or WES Operating s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, WES s or WES Operating s internal control over financial reporting.
