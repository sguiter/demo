 Legal Matters 
 Sonic is involved, and expects to continue to be involved, in various legal and administrative proceedings arising out of the conduct of its business, including regulatory investigations and private civil actions brought by plaintiffs purporting to represent a potential class or for which a class has been certified. Although Sonic is unable to predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation, regulatory investigation or inquiry, in the opinion of management, Sonic does not believe it is reasonably possible that its current and threatened legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on Sonic s business, financial position or consolidated results of operations. Given the inherent unpredictability of these types of proceedings, however, it is possible that future adverse outcomes could have a material adverse effect on Sonic s financial results. 
 There were no significant liabilities recorded related to legal matters as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Overview 
 We are one of the largest automotive retailers in the U.S. (as measured by reported total revenue). As a result of the way we manage our business, we had three reportable segments as of September 30, 2024: (1) the Franchised Dealerships Segment; (2) the EchoPark Segment; and (3) the Powersports Segment. For management and operational reporting purposes, we group certain businesses together that share management and inventory (principally used vehicles) into stores. As of September 30, 2024, we operated 106 stores in the Franchised Dealerships Segment, 18 stores in the EchoPark Segment and 13 stores in the Powersports Segment. The Franchised Dealerships Segment consists of 131 new vehicle franchises (representing 25 different brands of cars and light trucks) and 16 collision repair centers in 17 states. The EchoPark Segment consists of 18 stores in 10 states. The Powersports Segment consists of nine franchises and four authorized retail outlets in two states. 
 The Franchised Dealerships Segment provides comprehensive sales and services, including (1) sales of both new and used cars and light trucks; (2) sales of replacement parts and performance of vehicle maintenance, manufacturer warranty repairs, and paint and collision repair services (collectively, Fixed Operations and (3) arrangement of third-party financing, extended warranties, service contracts, insurance and other aftermarket products (collectively, F I for our guests. The EchoPark Segment sells used cars and light trucks and arranges third-party F I product sales for our guests in pre-owned vehicle specialty retail locations and does not offer customer-facing Fixed Operations services. The Powersports Segment offers guests: (1) sales of both new and used powersports vehicles (such as motorcycles, personal watercraft and all-terrain vehicles); (2) Fixed Operations activities; and (3) F I services. All three segments generally operate independently of one another with the exception of certain shared back-office functions and corporate overhead costs.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Executive Summary 
 Retail Automotive Industry Performance 
 The U.S. retail automotive industry s total new vehicle (retail and fleet combined) seasonally adjusted annual rate of unit sales volume (the total new vehicle SAAR increased 1 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, to approximately 15.6 million vehicles, compared to approximately 15.5 million vehicles for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, according to the Power Information Network PIN from J.D. Power. We currently estimate the 2024 new vehicle industry volume will be between 15.5 million vehicles (flat compared to 2023) and 15.7 million vehicles (an increase of 1 compared to 2023). The effects of interest rates, changes in consumer confidence, availability of consumer financing, manufacturer inventory production levels, incentive levels from automotive manufacturers or shifts in such levels, or timing of consumer demand as a result of economic conditions, natural disasters or other unforeseen circumstances could cause the actual 2024 new vehicle industry volume to vary from expectations. Many factors, including brand and geographic concentrations as well as the industry sales mix between retail and fleet new vehicle unit sales volume, have caused our past results to differ from the industry s overall trend. Our new vehicle sales strategy focuses on our retail new vehicle sales (as opposed to fleet new vehicle sales) and, as a result, we believe it is appropriate to compare our retail new vehicle unit sales volume to the industry retail new vehicle seasonally adjusted annual rate of unit sales volume (the retail new vehicle SAAR (which excludes fleet new vehicle sales). According to PIN from J.D. Power, the retail new vehicle SAAR increased 2 and 1 to approximately 12.9 million and 12.8 million vehicles for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from approximately 12.6 million and 12.7 million vehicles for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 CDK Outage 
 On June 19, 2024, CDK Global CDK ), a third-party provider of certain information systems, notified us that CDK had suspended certain systems used by us in response to a cybersecurity incident impacting CDK (the CDK outage ). As a result, we experienced disruptions to our dealer management system (the DMS ), our customer relationship management system (the CRM and other systems that support sales, inventory and accounting functions (collectively with the DMS and CRM the Affected Systems ). On June 26, 2024, CDK began restoring access to certain of the Affected Systems. We performed internal risk assessments and data validation procedures on the Affected Systems, and beginning June 30, 2024, we resumed processing transactions in the DMS. As of July 31, 2024, we regained access to all of the Affected Systems, including the CRM and inventory management applications. 
 During the CDK outage, all of our dealerships remained open and operating, utilizing workaround solutions to minimize the disruption caused by the CDK outage. However, the lack of access to the Affected Systems disrupted the efficient execution of our dealership operations and affected our ability to manage inventory, track customer leads, deliver vehicles and complete transactions with customers in a typical transaction timeframe. Despite the workarounds employed by the Company, the CDK outage significantly impaired our ability to sell both new and used vehicles within both our Franchised Dealership and EchoPark Segments in June and July 2024. The lower volume of vehicles sold as a result of the CDK outage also negatively impacted F I revenue within both segments during these periods. Additionally, our Fixed Operations revenue within the Franchised Dealership Segment was negatively impacted by the lack of access to certain systems used to process services during these periods. We estimate the disruption from the CDK outage negatively impacted reported income before taxes by approximately 30.0 million and 17.2 million during the three months June 30 and September 30, 2024, respectively, which includes approximately 11.6 million and 1.8 million in additional compensation expenses incurred as a result of the incident, respectively. We do not anticipate a material impact to our business, including our results of operations or financial condition, beyond those experienced in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Franchised Dealerships Segment 
 As a result of the acquisition, disposition, termination or closure of certain franchised dealership stores in 2023 and 2024, the change in reported amounts from period to period may not be indicative of the current or future operational or financial performance of our current group of operating stores.

SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Same store retail new vehicle revenue was flat during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven primarily by a 2 increase in retail new vehicle unit sales volume in both periods. The CDK outage also had a significant adverse impact on new vehicle unit sales volume during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Retail new vehicle gross profit decreased 33 and 31 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due primarily to increased price competition as a result of higher levels of available inventory and higher inventory invoice cost, which combined to drive lower retail new vehicle gross profit per unit. Retail new vehicle gross profit per unit decreased 1,633 per unit, or 35 , to 3,049 per unit during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 1,615 per unit, or 32 , to 3,446 per unit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. On a trailing quarter cost of sales basis, our reported Franchised Dealerships Segment new vehicle inventory days supply was approximately 57 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 33 days as of September 30, 2023, as a result of increased manufacturer production levels. 
 Same store retail used vehicle revenue decreased 10 and 6 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The 10 decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by an 8 decrease in retail used vehicle average selling prices and a 2 decrease in retail used vehicle sales volume. The 6 decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by an 8 decrease in retail used vehicle average selling prices, partially offset partially by a 2 increase in retail used vehicle unit sales volume. Retail used vehicle unit sales volume during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also adversely affected by the CDK outage. Retail used vehicle gross profit decreased 18 and 10 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to lower retail used vehicle gross profit per unit. Retail used vehicle gross profit per unit decreased 283 per unit, or 17 , to 1,386 per unit during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased 189 per unit, or 11 , to 1,505 per unit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to higher inventory acquisition costs and lower selling prices due to increased price competition as a result of ongoing consumer affordability challenges, including the effect of higher interest rates. Same store wholesale vehicle gross profit (loss) remained flat and worsened 1.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, on flat wholesale vehicle gross profit (loss) per unit during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a 124 per unit worsening of wholesale vehicle gross profit (loss) per unit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We generally focus on maintaining Franchised Dealerships Segment used vehicle inventory days supply in the 25- to 35-day range, which may fluctuate seasonally, in order to limit our exposure to market pricing volatility. On a trailing quarter cost of sales basis, our reported Franchised Dealerships Segment used vehicle inventory days supply was approximately 34 and 28 days as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Same store Fixed Operations revenue increased 7 and 4 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, driven primarily by higher parts and labor costs that were passed along to consumers, despite being negatively affected by the CDK outage. Fixed Operations gross profit increased 8 and 6 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, driven primarily by higher warranty revenue contribution and higher warranty gross margin. Fixed Operations gross margin increased 50 basis points, to 50.2 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased 60 basis points, to 50.2 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by an increase in warranty revenue contribution and higher warranty gross margin. 
 F I revenue decreased 3 and 2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, driven by lower gross profit per finance contract as a result of lower average retail new and used vehicle unit selling prices. F I revenues were also adversely affected by the CDK outage s adverse effect on new and used vehicle unit sales volume, which reduced the number of finance, service and aftermarket contracts we sold. F I gross profit per retail unit decreased 72 per unit, or 3 , to 2,339 per unit during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 82 per unit, or 3 , to 2,358 per unit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 EchoPark Segment 
 Reported total revenues decreased 13 and 14 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, driven primarily by a 7 decrease in retail used vehicle unit sales volume and a 9 decrease in average retail used vehicle unit selling prices in both periods. Retail used vehicle unit sales volume during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were also adversely affected by the CDK outage. Reported total gross profit increased 5 and 34 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The 5 increase during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a 12 increase in F I revenue, and the 34 increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a 177 increase in retail used vehicle gross profit. 
 Same market total revenues decreased 3 and increased 6 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The 3 decrease during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a 7 decrease in used retail vehicle unit prices, partially offset by a 2 increase in total retail used vehicle unit sales volume. The 6 increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a 12 increase in total retail used vehicle unit sales volume. Same market total gross profit increased 21 and 54 during the three and nine months ended

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 September 30, 2024, respectively. The 21 increase during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by a 2 increase in total retail used vehicle unit sales volume, and the 54 increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by a 242 increase in retail used vehicle gross profit per unit. 
 Reported retail used vehicle revenue decreased 15 during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven primarily by a 9 decrease in average retail used vehicle unit selling prices during both periods. F I revenue increased 12 and 6 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, driven primarily by a 20 and 14 increase in F I gross profit per unit, respectively, partially offset by the decrease in retail used vehicle unit sales volume. Reported combined retail used vehicle and F I gross profit per unit increased 344 per unit, or 12 , to 3,111 per unit during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased 952 per unit, or 45 , to 3,047 per unit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to increases in F I revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Reported wholesale vehicle gross profit (loss) worsened approximately 0.2 million and 2.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to a 143 and 155 worsening in wholesale vehicle gross profit (loss) per unit, respectively. We generally focus on maintaining EchoPark Segment used vehicle inventory days supply in the 30- to 40-day range, which may fluctuate seasonally, in order to limit our exposure to market pricing volatility. On a trailing quarter cost of sales basis, our reported EchoPark Segment used vehicle inventory days supply was approximately 33 and 37 days as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Powersports Segment 
 Reported retail new vehicle revenue remained flat during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a 9 decrease in retail new vehicle unit sales volume, offset by a 10 increase in retail new vehicle average selling prices. Reported retail new vehicle revenue decreased 11 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by a 15 decrease in retail new vehicle unit sales volume. Retail new vehicle gross profit decreased 31 and 35 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as a result of a 23 decrease in retail new vehicle gross profit per unit and lower retail new vehicle unit sales volume in both periods. Retail new vehicle gross profit per unit decreased 964 per unit, or 23 , to 3,249 per unit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 860 per unit, or 23 , to 2,820 per unit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher inventory costs. On a trailing quarter cost of sales basis, our reported Powersports Segment new vehicle inventory days supply was approximately 121 and 107 days as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, varying based on manufacturer production levels and consumer demand. 
 Reported retail used vehicle revenue increased 84 and 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by a 99 and 19 increase in used unit prices, respectively. Retail used vehicle gross profit decreased 8 and 9 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as a result of lower retail used vehicle unit sales volume. Retail used vehicle gross profit per unit decreased 35 per unit, or 1 , to 2,798 per unit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased 130 per unit, or 5 , to 2,537 per unit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to lower inventory costs.

 Reported Fixed Operations revenue decreased 7 and 5 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and Fixed Operations gross profit decreased 10 and 8 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, driven primarily by lower repair order volume. Fixed Operations gross margin decreased 120 basis points to 45.9 and decreased 140 basis points to 46.4 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, driven primarily by a decrease in customer pay revenue contribution and lower customer pay gross margin. 
 Reported F I revenue decreased 4 and 2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, driven primarily by an 8 and 15 decrease in combined retail new and used vehicle unit sales volume in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively offset by a 6 and 15 increase in F I gross profit per retail unit in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. F I gross profit per retail unit increased 61 per unit, or 6 , to 1,136 per unit and increased 151 per unit, or 15 , to 1,157 per unit during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

 New vehicle revenues include the sale of new vehicles, including new powersports vehicles, to retail customers, as well as the sale of fleet vehicles to businesses for use in their operations. New vehicle revenues and gross profit can be influenced by vehicle manufacturer incentives to consumers (which vary from cash-back incentives to low interest rate financing, among other things), the availability of consumer credit and the level and type of manufacturer-to-dealer incentives, as well as manufacturers providing adequate inventory allocations to our dealerships to meet consumer demand. The automobile manufacturing industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand, both within specific brands and in the industry as a whole. As an automotive retailer, we seek to mitigate the effects of this sales cycle by maintaining a diverse brand mix of dealerships. Our brand diversity allows us to offer a broad range of products at a wide range of prices from lower-priced economy automobiles to luxury automobiles and powersports vehicles.

 The U.S. retail automotive industry s new vehicle unit sales volume below reflects all brands marketed or sold in the U.S. This industry sales volume includes brands we do not sell and markets in which we do not operate, therefore, changes in our new vehicle unit sales volume may not trend directly in line with changes in the industry new vehicle unit sales volume. We believe that the industry retail new vehicle unit sales volume is a more meaningful metric for comparing our new vehicle unit sales volume to the industry due to our minimal fleet vehicle business.

 Used Vehicles Consolidated 
 Used vehicle revenues include the sale of used vehicles, including used powersports vehicles, to retail customers and at wholesale. Used vehicle revenues are directly affected by a number of factors, including consumer demand for used vehicles, the pricing and level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles, the number and quality of trade-ins and lease turn-ins available to our dealerships, the availability and pricing of used vehicles acquired at wholesale auction, and the availability of consumer credit. Depending on the mix of inventory sourcing (trade-ins or purchases from customers versus wholesale auction), the days supply of used vehicle inventory, and the pricing strategy employed by the dealership, retail used vehicle gross profit per unit and retail used vehicle gross profit as a percentage of revenue may vary significantly from historical levels given recent trends in the used vehicle environment.

 Wholesale Vehicles Consolidated 
 
 Wholesale vehicle revenues are affected by retail new and used vehicle unit sales volume and the associated trade-in volume, as well as short-term, temporary and seasonal fluctuations in wholesale auction pricing. In recent years, wholesale vehicle prices and supply at auction have experienced periods of volatility, impacting our wholesale vehicle revenues and related gross profit (loss), as well as our retail used vehicle revenues and related gross profit. We believe that wholesale vehicle pricing and volatility have begun to normalize throughout 2024, and we expect this trend will continue through the remainder of the year. Wholesale vehicle revenues are also significantly affected by our corporate inventory management strategy and policies, which are designed to optimize our total used vehicle inventory and expected gross profit levels and minimize inventory carrying risks.

 Fixed Operations Consolidated 
 Parts, service and collision repair revenues consist of repairs and maintenance requested and paid by customers customer pay ), warranty repairs (manufacturer-paid), wholesale parts (sales of parts and accessories to third-party automotive repair businesses) and internal, sublet and other. Parts and service revenue is driven by the volume and mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs, available service capacity (a combination of service bay count and technician availability), vehicle quality, manufacturer recalls, customer loyalty, and prepaid or manufacturer-paid maintenance programs. Internal, sublet and other primarily relates to preparation and reconditioning work performed on vehicles in inventory that are later sold to a third party and may vary based on used vehicle inventory and sales volume from period to period. When that work is performed by one of our dealerships or stores, the work is classified as internal. In the event the work is performed by a third party on our behalf, it is classified as sublet. 
 We believe that, over time, vehicle quality will continue to improve, but vehicle complexity and the associated demand for repairs by qualified technicians at manufacturer-affiliated dealerships may result in market share gains that could offset any revenue lost from improvement in vehicle quality. We also believe that, over the long term, we have the ability to continue to optimize service capacity and customer retention at our dealerships and stores to further increase Fixed Operations revenues. Manufacturers continue to extend new vehicle warranty periods (in particular for battery electric vehicles) and have also begun to include regular maintenance items in the warranty or complimentary maintenance program coverage. These factors, over the long term, combined with the extended manufacturer warranties on certified pre-owned vehicles, should facilitate growth in our parts and service business. Barriers to long-term growth may include reductions in the rate paid by manufacturers to dealers for warranty repair work performed, as well as the improved quality and design of vehicles that may affect the level and frequency of future customer pay or warranty-related repair revenues.

 F I Consolidated 
 Finance, insurance and other, net revenues include commissions for arranging third-party vehicle financing and insurance, sales of third-party extended warranties and service contracts for vehicles, and sales of other aftermarket products. In connection with vehicle financing, extended warranties and service contracts, other aftermarket products and insurance contracts, we receive commissions from the third-party providers for originating these contracts. F I revenues are recognized net of actual and estimated future chargebacks and other costs associated with originating contracts (as a result, reported F I revenues and F I gross profit are the same amount, resulting in a 100 gross margin for F I). F I revenues are affected by the level of new and retail used vehicle unit sales volume, the age and average selling price of vehicles sold, the level of manufacturer financing specials or leasing incentives, and our F I penetration rate for each type of F I product. The F I penetration rate represents the number of finance contracts, extended warranties and service contracts, other aftermarket products or insurance contracts that we are able to originate per vehicle sold, expressed as a percentage. 
 Yield spread premium is another term for the commission earned by our dealerships for arranging vehicle financing for consumers. The amount of the commission could be zero, a flat fee or an actual spread between the interest rate charged to the consumer and the interest rate provided by the third-party direct financing source (e.g., a commercial bank, credit union or manufacturer captive finance company). We have established caps on the potential yield spread premium our dealerships can earn with all finance sources. We believe the yield spread premium we earn for arranging vehicle financing represents value to the consumer in numerous ways, including the following: 
 lower cost, below-market financing is often available only from the manufacturers captives and franchised dealers; 
 ease of access to multiple high-quality lending sources; 
 lease-financing alternatives are largely available only from manufacturers captives or other indirect lenders; 
 guests with substandard credit frequently do not have direct access to potential sources of sub-prime financing; and 
 guests with significant negative equity in their current vehicle (i.e., the guest s current vehicle is worth less than the balance of their vehicle loan or lease obligation) frequently are unable to pay off the loan on their current vehicle and finance the purchase or lease of a replacement new or used vehicle without the assistance of a franchised dealership s network of lending sources.

Results of Operations EchoPark Segment 
 All currently operating EchoPark stores in a local geographic market are included within the same market group as of the first full month following the first anniversary of the market s opening or acquisition. Same market results may vary significantly from reported results due to the closure of stores that are no longer included in same market results. 
 On June 22, 2023, Sonic announced a plan to indefinitely suspend operations at eight EchoPark locations and 14 related delivery/buy centers. In addition, during the third quarter of 2023, we closed three Northwest Motorsport locations within the EchoPark Segment. In January 2024, we closed the remaining seven Northwest Motorsport stores. In light of these closures, we believe the following discussion of EchoPark Segment results on a same market basis provides a more meaningful year-over-year comparison.

 Used Vehicles and F I EchoPark Segment 
 Our EchoPark operating strategy focuses on maximizing total used vehicle-related gross profit (based on a combination of retail used vehicle unit sales volume, front-end retail used vehicle gross profit (loss) per unit and F I gross profit per retail unit sold) rather than realizing traditional levels of front-end retail used vehicle gross profit per unit. As such, we believe the best per unit measure of gross profit performance at our EchoPark stores is a combined total gross profit (loss) per retail unit, which includes both front-end retail used vehicle gross profit (loss) and F I gross profit per retail unit sold. See the discussion under the heading Results of Operations - Consolidated for additional discussion of the macro drivers of used vehicle revenues and F I revenues. 
 All Fixed Operations activity at our EchoPark stores supports our used vehicle inventory reconditioning operations and EchoPark stores do not currently perform customer pay repairs or maintenance work and are not permitted to perform manufacturer-paid warranty repairs. As such, reconditioning amounts that are classified as Fixed Operations revenues and cost of sales in our Franchised Dealerships Segment are presented as used vehicle cost of sales for the EchoPark Segment.

Selling, General and Administrative SG A Expenses Consolidated 
 Consolidated SG A expenses are comprised of four major groups: compensation expense, advertising expense, rent expense and other expense. Compensation expense primarily relates to store personnel who are paid a commission or a salary plus commission and support personnel who are generally paid a fixed salary. Commissions paid to store personnel typically vary depending on gross profits realized and sales volume objectives. Due to the salary component for certain store and corporate personnel, gross profits and compensation expense do not change in direct proportion to one another. Advertising expense and other expense vary based on the level of actual or anticipated business activity and the number of dealerships in operation. Rent expense typically varies with the number of store locations owned, investments made for facility improvements and interest rates. Other expense includes various fixed and variable expenses, including gain on the disposal of franchises, certain customer-related costs such as gasoline and service loaners, and insurance, training, legal and information technology expenses, which may not change in proportion to gross profit levels. Typically, SG A expenses as a percentage of gross profit are highest in the first quarter of the year, due to the seasonal nature of our business and the effects of certain payroll taxes and fringe benefits that occur early in the year.

Compensation expense decreased in dollar amount and increased as a percentage of gross profit, primarily due to the closure of stores in the EchoPark Segment. Advertising expense decreased in dollar amount and increased as a percentage of gross profit, as a result of adapting our advertising spending to current retail automotive market conditions, including higher inventory availability and lower new vehicle gross profit levels. Rent expense decreased in both dollar amount and as a percentage of gross profit, primarily due to the purchase of several properties that were previously leased and the closure of stores in the EchoPark Segment.

 Interest Expense, Floor Plan Consolidated 
 We typically maintain a floor plan deposit balance (as shown in the table below under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources that earns interest income based on the floor plan interest rate, effectively reducing the net used vehicle floor plan interest expense. The below discussion of interest expense, floor plan includes the effect of interest income earned on the floor plan deposit balance, unless otherwise noted. Our interest expense, floor plan fluctuates with changes in our outstanding borrowing and associated interest rates, which are variable based on SOFR or the U.S. prime rate, plus a credit spread.

 franchise assets in 2022 resulting in a favorable rate impact of 51.0 and 17.8 respectively for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We require cash to service debt, meet lease obligations, manage working capital requirements, make facility and other capital improvements, pay dividends on our common stock, finance acquisitions and otherwise invest in our business. We rely on cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit and floor plan borrowing arrangements, real estate mortgage financing, asset sales and offerings of debt and equity securities to meet these requirements. However, our liquidity could be negatively affected by business performance and could result in failure to comply with the financial covenants in our existing debt obligations or lease arrangements. After giving effect to the applicable restrictions on the payment of dividends under our debt agreements, as of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 320.2 million of net income and retained earnings free of such restrictions. Cash flows provided by our dealerships are derived from various sources. The primary sources include individual consumers, automobile manufacturers, automobile manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries and other financial institutions. Disruptions in these cash flows could have a material adverse impact on our operations and overall liquidity. 
 Because the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries, the majority of our cash flows from operations are generated by these subsidiaries. As a result, our cash flows and our ability to service our obligations depend to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries, their contractual obligations and capital requirements, and their ability to provide us with cash. 
 We had the following liquidity resources available as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents 17.6 28.9 Floor plan deposit balance 400.0 345.0 Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility 321.1 298.6 Availability under the Mortgage Facility 95.0 173.0 Total available liquidity resources 833.7 845.5 
 We maintain a floor plan deposit balance (as shown in the table above) that offsets interest based on the agreed upon floor plan interest rate, effectively reducing the net used vehicle floor plan interest expense with the lender. This deposit balance is not designated as a prepayment of notes payable - floor plan, nor is it our intent to use this amount to offset principal amounts owed under notes payable - floor plan in the future, although we have the right and ability to do so. The deposit balances of 400.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and 345.0 million as of December 31, 2023 are classified as other current assets in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Floor Plan Facilities 
 We finance all of our new and certain of our used vehicle inventory through standardized floor plan facilities with: (1) certain manufacturer captive finance companies (classified as notes payable - floor plan - trade in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets) and (2) a syndicate of manufacturer-affiliated captive finance companies and commercial banks (classified as notes payable - floor plan - non-trade in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets). These floor plan facilities are due on demand and currently bear interest at variable rates based on either one-month Term SOFR or prime plus an additional spread, as applicable. The weighted-average interest rate for our combined new and used vehicle floor plan facilities was 4.97 for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 6.27 and 4.87 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding the effect of interest income earned on the floor plan deposit balance, the weighted-average interest rate for our combined new and used vehicle floor plan facilities was 6.43 and 6.41 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 7.95 and 6.24 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We receive floor plan assistance in the form of direct payments or credits from certain manufacturers. Floor plan assistance received is capitalized in inventory and recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. We received approximately 16.7 million and 14.7 million in manufacturer assistance in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 45.7 million and 42.9 million in manufacturer assistance in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recognized in cost of sales approximatel y 16.3 million and 14.5 million in manufacturer assistance in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 
 75 

SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 approximately 46.8 million and 42.3 million in manufacturer assistance in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest payments under each of our floor plan facilities are due monthly and we are generally not required to make principal repayments prior to the sale of the associated vehicles. 
 
 Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities 
 See Note 6, Long-Term Debt, to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long-term debt, mortgage notes and credit facilities and compliance with debt covenants. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Our capital expenditures include the purchase of land and buildings, the construction of new franchised dealerships, EchoPark and powersports stores and collision repair centers, building improvements and equipment purchased for use in our franchised dealerships and EchoPark and powersports stores. We selectively construct new or improve existing franchised dealership facilities to maintain compliance with manufacturers image requirements. We typically finance these projects through cash flows from operations, new mortgages or our credit facilities. 
 Capital expenditures in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 145.9 million, including approximately 141.4 million related to our Franchised Dealerships Segment, approximately 0.8 million related to our EchoPark Segment and approximately 3.7 million related to our Powersports Segment. Of the total capital expenditures, approximately 91.1 million was related to facility construction projects, approximately 18.1 million was related to acquisitions of real estate (land and buildings) and approximately 36.7 million was for other fixed assets utilized in our operations. 
 All of the 145.9 million in gross capital expenditures in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was funded through existing cash balances. As of September 30, 2024, commitments for facility construction projects totaled approximately 14.3 million, nearly all of which is expected to be completed in the next 12 months. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock. Historically, we have used our share repurchase authorization to offset dilution caused by the exercise of stock options or the vesting of equity compensation awards and to maintain our desired capital structure. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of our Class A Common Stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of our Class A Common Stock for approximately 27.1 million in open-market transactions at prevailing market prices and in connection with tax withholding on the vesting of equity compensation awards. As of September 30, 2024, our total remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately 259.6 million. Under the Credit Facilities, share repurchases are permitted to the extent that no Event of Default exists and we do not exceed the restrictions set forth in our debt agreements. After giving effect to the applicable restrictions on share repurchases and certain other transactions under our debt agreements, as of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 320.2 million of net income and retained earnings free of such restrictions. 
 Our share repurchase activity is subject to the business judgment of our Board of Directors and management, taking into consideration our historical and projected results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, capital requirements and covenant compliance, the current economic environment and other factors considered by our Board of Directors and management to be relevant. These factors are considered each quarter and will be scrutinized as our Board of Directors and management determine our share repurchase policy in the future. 
 
 Dividends 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of 0.30 per share on all outstanding shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock as of September 13, 2024, which was paid on October 15, 2024. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 16.7 increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 0.35 per share on all outstanding shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock as of December 13, 2024 to be paid on January 15, 2025. The Credit Facilities permit quarterly cash dividends on our Class A and Class B Common Stock up to 0.18 per share so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and provided that we remain in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facilities. Additional dividends are permitted subject to the limitations on restricted payments set forth in the Credit Facilities. The 2029 Indenture and the 2031 Indenture also contain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. After giving effect to the applicable restrictions on share repurchases and certain other transactions under our debt agreements, as of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 320.2 million of net income and retained earnings free of such restrictions. The declaration and payment of any future dividend is subject to the business judgment of our Board of Directors, taking into consideration our historical and projected results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, capital 
 76 

SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 requirements and covenant compliance, share repurchases, the current economic environment and other factors considered by our Board of Directors to be relevant. These factors are considered each quarter and will be scrutinized as our Board of Directors determines our dividend policy in the future. There is no guarantee that additional dividends will be declared and paid at any time in the future. See Note 6, Long-Term Debt, to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of restrictions on the payment of dividends. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 21.5 million. This provision of cash was comprised primarily of net income less non-cash items, a decrease in receivables and an increase in trade accounts payable and other liabilities, offset partially by an increase in inventories and other assets. Net cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 104.2 million. This provision of cash was comprised primarily of net income less non-cash items, a decrease in receivables, an increase in trade accounts payable and other liabilities and an increase in notes payable floor plan trade, offset partially by an increase in inventories. 
 We arrange our inventory floor plan financing through both manufacturer captive finance companies and a syndicate of manufacturer-affiliated finance companies and commercial banks. Our floor plan financed with manufacturer captives is recorded in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as notes payable - floor plan - trade (with the change in balance being reflected in operating cash flows). Our dealerships that obtain floor plan financing from a syndicate of manufacturer-affiliated finance companies and commercial banks record their obligation in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as notes payable - floor plan - non-trade (with the change in balance being reflected in financing cash flows). 
 Due to the presentation differences for changes in trade floor plan financing and non-trade floor plan financing in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, decisions made by us to move dealership floor plan financing arrangements from one finance source to another may cause significant variations in operating and financing cash flows without affecting our overall liquidity, working capital or cash flows. Upon entering into the Floor Plan Facilities in April 2021, the majority of our outstanding floor plan liabilities were reclassified from trade floor plan liabilities to non-trade floor plan liabilities, resulting in a significant reclassification of related floor plan liability cash flows from operating activities to financing activities. 
 Net cash provided by combined trade and non-trade floor plan financing was approximately 107.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash provided by combined trade and non-trade floor plan financing was approximately 159.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Accordingly, if all changes in floor plan notes payable were classified as an operating activity (to align changes in floor plan liability balances with the associated changes in inventory balances for cash flow classification), the result would have been net cash provided by operating activities of approximately 121.1 million and 257.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 87.0 million. This use of cash was comprised primarily of the purchase of land, property and equipment, partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of land, property and equipment and the proceeds from the sales of dealerships. Net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 171.4 million. This use of cash was comprised primarily of the purchase of a powersports business (including real property), net of cash acquired, and the purchase of land, property and equipment, partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of four franchised dealerships. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 54.2 million. This provision of cash was comprised primarily of net borrowings on notes payable floor plan non-trade. Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 127.4 million. This use of cash was comprised primarily of purchases of treasury stock and payments on long-term debt, offset partially by net borrowings on notes payable floor plan non-trade. 
 One metric that management uses to measure operating performance is Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) for each of the Company s reportable segments and on a consolidated basis. We believe Adjusted EBITDA enables our operating performance to be compared across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding non-floor plan financing costs, non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and impairment charges, and other items that may affect the comparability of reporting periods, including, but not limited to, gains or losses from acquisitions or dispositions, facility exit costs, severance and long-term compensation charges, and storm damage charges. This non-GAAP financial measure is reconciled to net income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) in the tables below:

 Seasonality 
 Our operations are subject to seasonal variations. Due in part to our franchised dealerships brand mix and the seasonal nature of automotive retail, the first quarter historically has contributed less operating profit than the second and third quarters, while the fourth quarter historically has contributed the highest operating profit of any quarter. Weather conditions and the timing of manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers cause seasonality and may adversely affect vehicle demand and, consequently, our profitability. Comparatively, parts and service demand has historically remained stable throughout the year. 
 
 Future Liquidity Outlook 
 We believe our best sources of liquidity for operations and debt service remain cash flows generated from operations combined with the availability of borrowings under our floor plan facilities (or any replacements thereof), the Credit Facilities (or any replacements thereof), the Mortgage Facility (or any replacements thereof) and real estate mortgage financing, selected dealership and other asset sales and our ability to raise funds in the capital markets through offerings of debt or equity securities. Because the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries, the majority of our cash flows from operations are generated by these subsidiaries. As a result, our cash flows and our ability to service our obligations depend to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries, their contractual obligations and capital requirements, and their ability to provide us with cash. 
 We do not currently anticipate any materially negative changes to our cost of, or access to, capital over the next 12 months. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations 
 In connection with the operation and disposition of our dealerships, we have entered into various guarantees and indemnification obligations. When we sell dealerships, we attempt to assign any related lease to the buyer of the dealership to eliminate any future liability. However, if we are unable to assign the related leases to the buyer, we will attempt to sublease the leased properties to the buyer at a rate equal to the terms of the original leases. In the event we are unable to sublease the properties to the buyer with terms at least equal to our leases, we may be required to record lease exit accruals. As of September 30, 2024, our future gross minimum lease payments related to properties subleased to buyers of sold dealerships totaled approximately 4.7 million. Future sublease payments expected to be received related to these lease payments were approximately 4.6 million at September 30, 2024. 
 In accordance with the terms of agreements entered into for the sale of our dealerships, we generally agree to indemnify the buyer from certain liabilities and costs arising subsequent to the date of sale, including environmental exposure and exposure resulting from the breach of representations or warranties made in accordance with the agreements. While our exposure with respect to environmental remediation is difficult to quantify, our maximum exposure associated with these general indemnifications was approximately 8.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and 8.0 million as of December 31, 2023. These indemnifications typically expire within a period of one to three years following the date of sale. The estimated fair value of these indemnifications was not material and the amount recorded for this contingency was not significant at September 30, 2024. 
 We also guarantee the floor plan commitments of our 50 -owned joint venture, and the amount of such guarantee at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately 4.3 million. We expect the aggregate amount of the obligations we guarantee to fluctuate based on dealership disposition activity. Although we seek to mitigate our exposure in connection with these matters, these guarantees and indemnification obligations, including environmental exposures and the financial performance of lease assignees and sublessees, cannot be predicted with certainty. An unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources. See Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion regarding these guarantees and indemnification obligations.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our variable rate floor plan facilities, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Mortgage Facility and our other variable rate notes expose us to risks caused by fluctuations in the applicable interest rates. The total net outstanding balance of such variable instruments, after considering the effect of outstanding cash flow hedge instruments, was approximately 1.9 billion at September 30, 2024. Based on that amount along with the notional value of interest rate caps in place on that date, a decrease of 100 basis points in the underlying interest rates would have reduced interest expense by ap proximately 14.3 million while a 100-basis point increase in rates would have resulted in approximately 10.2 million of additional interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Of those changes, approximately 10.9 million of the decrease and approximately 6.9 million of the increase would have resulted from the floor plan, net of offset. The difference between the increases and decreases results from the mitigating effect of the interest rate caps.

SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC. 

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and our CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods is subject to risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC. 

 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as noted below, which replaces in its entirety, the risk factor Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. 
 Security breaches and other disruptions to our information systems could compromise our confidential, competitive or otherwise sensitive information and expose us to liability, disrupt our business operations and otherwise negatively affect our business, including our reputation, results from operations and financial condition. 
 We have invested in internal and external business applications to execute our strategy of employing technology to benefit our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. Moreover, we utilize third-party software, systems and services to support critical dealership operations. The frequency and severity of cybersecurity incidents has increased in recent years and adversely impacted organizations of varying sizes. Although we have attempted to mitigate the cybersecurity risk of both our internal and outsourced functions by implementing various cybersecurity controls, an internal framework for the oversight of cybersecurity risks and other security measures, specifically as described in Item 1C. Cybersecurity of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our information technology and infrastructure, including the systems that are provided to us by third-parties, have been, and may in the future be, vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. 
 We have experienced, and may again in the future experience, material negative impacts on our business and results of operations as a result of a cybersecurity incident. Specifically, on June 19, 2024, CDK, a third-party provider of certain information systems, notified us that CDK had suspended certain systems used by us in response to a cybersecurity incident impacting CDK. As a result, we experienced disruptions to the affected systems, which negatively impacted our ability to conduct sales, track inventory, coordinate business functions and otherwise efficiently execute our business operations. As a result of the CDK outage, our business and results of operations during the second and third fiscal quarters of 2024 were adversely affected. 
 Although we are working with CDK and other information technology vendors and taking steps to strengthen our systems infrastructure, there can be no assurance that we will not be affected by another cyberattack or other cybersecurity incident affecting our information systems, including those provided to us by third parties. We remain exposed to the risk of additional interruptions of service or loss of access to systems (including our internal or externally hosted business applications) supporting our critical business functions and processes, which may negatively affect our ability to deliver vehicles or complete transactions with customers; unauthorized access or theft of customer or employee personal confidential information, including financial information, or strategically sensitive data; disruption of communications (both internally and externally) that may affect the quality of information used to make informed business decisions; additional costs and expenses; and damage to our reputation. Any cybersecurity breach or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, lost sales or damage to our reputation, and otherwise cause a loss of confidence in our services, which could materially adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.
