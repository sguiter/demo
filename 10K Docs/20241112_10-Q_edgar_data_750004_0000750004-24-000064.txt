The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are generally located in the material set forth under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations but may be found in other locations as well. These statements are based upon management s current expectations, assumptions and estimates and are not guarantees of timing, future results or performance. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors, including, among other things: 
 our inability to successfully execute our strategy; 
 slow growth of new gaming jurisdictions, slow addition of casinos in existing jurisdictions and declines in the replacement cycle of gaming machines; 
 risks relating to foreign operations, including anti-corruption laws, fluctuations in currency rates, restrictions on the payment of dividends from earnings, restrictions on the import of products and financial instability; 
 difficulty predicting what impact, if any, new tariffs imposed by and other trade actions taken by the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions could have on our business;

 restrictions and covenants in debt agreements, including those that could result in acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness; 
 competition; 
 inability to win, retain or renew, or unfavorable revisions of, existing contracts, and the inability to enter into new contracts; 
 risks and uncertainties of potential changes in U.K. gaming legislation, including any new or revised licensing and taxation regimes, responsible gambling requirements and/or sanctions on unlicensed providers; 
 inability to adapt to, and offer products that keep pace with, evolving technology, including any failure of our investment of significant resources in our R D efforts; 
 failure to retain key management and employees;

 legislative interpretation and enforcement, regulatory perception and regulatory risks with respect to gaming, especially internet wagering and social gaming; 
 changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or the examination of our tax positions; 
 opposition to legalized gaming or the expansion thereof and potential restrictions on internet wagering; 
 significant opposition in some jurisdictions to interactive social gaming, including social casino gaming and how such opposition could lead these jurisdictions to adopt legislation or impose a regulatory framework to govern interactive social gaming or social casino gaming specifically, and how this could result in a prohibition on interactive social gaming or social casino gaming altogether, restrict our ability to advertise our games, or substantially increase our costs to comply with these regulations; 
 expectations of shift to regulated digital gaming; 
 inability to develop successful products and services and capitalize on trends and changes in our industries, including the expansion of internet and other forms of digital gaming;

 You should also note that this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain references to industry market data and certain industry forecasts. Industry market data and industry forecasts are obtained from publicly available information and industry publications. Industry publications generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of that information is not guaranteed. Although we believe industry information to be accurate, it is not independently verified by us and we do not make any representation as to the accuracy of that information. In general, we believe there is less publicly available information concerning the international gaming, social and digital gaming industries than the same industries in the U.S.

of our total receivables, net, were past due by over 90 days, compared to as of December 31, 2023. 
 Credit Quality of Receivables 
 We have certain concentrations of outstanding receivables in international locations that impact our assessment of the credit quality of our receivables. We monitor the macroeconomic and political environment in each of these locations in our assessment of the credit quality of our receivables. The international customers with significant concentrations (generally deemed to be exceeding 10 of our receivables with terms longer than one year are in the Latin America region LATAM and are primarily comprised of Mexico, Peru and Argentina. 
 Allowance for credit losses ) ) ) Receivables, net 
 We continuously review receivables and, as information concerning credit quality and/or overall economic environment arises, reassess our expectations of future losses and record an incremental reserve if warranted at that time. Our current allowance for credit losses represents our current expectation of credit losses; however, future expectations could change as international unrest or other macro-economic factors impact the financial stability of our customers. 
 The fair value of receivables is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and remaining maturities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of receivables, net, approximated the carrying value due to contractual terms of receivables generally being less than 24 months.

 LNWI Term Loan B Repricing 
 On January 16, 2024 and July 17, 2024, we amended the LNWI Credit Agreement and reduced the applicable margin on the LNWI Term Loan B. Following the July 2024 amendment, the interest rate for the Term Loan B is either (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the LNWI Credit Agreement) plus per annum or (ii) a base rate plus per annum. 
 We were in compliance with the financial covenants under all debt agreements as of September 30, 2024 (for information regarding our financial covenants of all debt agreements, see Note 15 in our 2023 10-K).

 All gains and losses from these hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until the future underlying payment transactions occur. Any realized gains or losses resulting from the hedges are recognized (together with the hedged transaction) as interest expense. We estimate the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by discounting the future cash flows of both the fixed rate and variable rate interest payments based on market yield curves. The inputs used to measure the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as established by ASC 820.) ) Interest income related to interest rate swap contracts recorded in interest expense

 (15) Litigation 
 million and million for all of our legal matters that were contingencies as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Substantially all of our legal contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Consequently, the ultimate outcomes of our legal contingencies could result in losses in excess of amounts we have accrued. We may be unable to estimate a range of possible losses for some matters pending against us or our subsidiaries, even when the amount of damages claimed against us or our subsidiaries is stated because, among other things: (1) the claimed amount may be exaggerated or unsupported; (2) the claim may be based on a novel legal theory or involve a large number of parties; (3) there may be uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class; (4) there may be uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions; (5) the matter may not have progressed sufficiently through discovery or there may be significant factual or legal issues to be resolved or developed; and/or (6) there may be uncertainty as to the enforceability of legal judgments and outcomes in certain jurisdictions. Other matters have progressed sufficiently that we are able to estimate a range of possible loss. For those legal contingencies disclosed below, and those related to the previously disclosed settlement agreement entered into in February 2015 with SNAI S.p.a. SNAI ), as to which a loss is reasonably possible, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is up to approximately million in excess of the accrued liabilities (if any) related to those legal contingencies. This aggregate range represents management s estimate of additional possible loss in excess of the accrued liabilities (if any) with respect to these matters based on currently available information, including any damages claimed by the plaintiffs, and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and inherent uncertainties. For example, at the time of making an estimate, management may have only preliminary, incomplete, or inaccurate information about the facts underlying a claim; its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal

Colombia Litigation 
 Our subsidiary, LNWI, owned a minority interest in Wintech de Colombia S.A., or Wintech (now liquidated), which formerly operated the Colombian national lottery under a contract with Empresa Colombiana de Recursos para la Salud, S.A. (together with its successors, Ecosalud ), an agency of the Colombian government. The contract provided for a penalty against Wintech, LNWI and the other shareholders of Wintech of up to million if certain levels of lottery sales were not achieved. In addition, LNWI delivered to Ecosalud a million surety bond as a further guarantee of performance under the contract. Wintech started the instant lottery in Colombia but, due to difficulties beyond its control, including, among other factors, social and political unrest in Colombia, frequently interrupted telephone service and power outages, and competition from another lottery being operated in a province of Colombia that we believe was in violation of Wintech s exclusive license from Ecosalud, the projected sales level was not met for the year ended June 30, 1993. 
 In 1993, Ecosalud issued a resolution declaring that the contract was in default. In 1994, Ecosalud issued a liquidation resolution asserting claims for compensation and damages against Wintech, LNWI and other shareholders of Wintech for, among other things, realization of the full amount of the penalty, plus interest, and the amount of the bond. LNWI filed separate actions opposing each resolution with the Tribunal Contencioso of Cundinamarca in Colombia (the Tribunal ), which upheld both resolutions. LNWI appealed each decision to the Council of State. In May 2012, the Council of State upheld the contract default resolution, which decision was notified to us in August 2012. In October 2013, the Council of State upheld the liquidation resolution, which decision was notified to us in December 2013. 
 In July 1996, Ecosalud filed a lawsuit against LNWI in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia asserting many of the same claims asserted in the Colombia proceedings, including breach of contract, and seeking damages. In March 1997, the District Court dismissed Ecosalud s claims. Ecosalud appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court s decision in 1998. 
 In June 1999, Ecosalud filed a collection proceeding against LNWI to enforce the liquidation resolution and recover the claimed damages. In May 2013, the Tribunal denied LNWI s merit defenses to the collection proceeding and issued an order of payment of approximately billion Colombian pesos, or approximately million, plus default interest (potentially accrued since 1994 at a 12 statutory interest rate). LNWI filed an appeal to the Council of State, and on December 10, 2020, the Council of State issued a ruling affirming the Tribunal s decision. On December 16, 2020, LNWI filed a motion for clarification of the Council of State s ruling, which was denied on April 15, 2021. On April 22, 2021, LNWI filed a motion for reconsideration relating to that decision, which the Council of State denied on February 21, 2022. On May 24, 2022, the case was transferred from the Council of State to the Tribunal for further proceedings. On August 18, 2022, LNWI filed a constitutional challenge to the Council of State s December 10, 2020 decision with that court, which was denied on October 7, 2022. On December 7, 2022, LNWI filed an appeal with the Council of State from the denial of the constitutional challenge, which was denied on May 24, 2023. On June 28, 2023, the Colombian Constitutional Court received the record of the constitutional appeal for further consideration, and on September 26, 2023, that court selected LNWI s constitutional appeal for further consideration. On April 25, 2024, LNWI was notified that, by means of a decision dated April 5, 2024, a three-judge panel of the Colombian Constitutional Court denied LNWI s constitutional appeal. On April 30, 2024, LNWI filed a motion to have that panel ruling declared null and void by the full Chamber of the Colombian Constitutional Court. On November 7, 2024, LNWI was notified that, by means of a decision dated August 8, 2024, the full Chamber of the Colombian Constitutional Court denied LNWI s motion filed on April 30, 2024. 
 LNWI believes it has various defenses, including on the merits, against Ecosalud s claims. Although we believe these claims will not result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position, it is not feasible to predict the final outcome, and we cannot assure that these claims will not ultimately be resolved adversely to us or result in material liability.

Revenue 
 Consolidated Revenue by Business Segment (in millions) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Gaming revenue growth of 15 for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by global Gaming machine sales growth of 38 and 33 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, coupled with continued strength in Gaming operations as well as the success of our diversified portfolio of successful game franchises. 
 SciPlay revenue increased 5 and 8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to increased average revenue per daily active user and average monthly revenue per paying user. Average revenue per daily active user grew 8 and 11 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, while average monthly revenue per paying user increased 6 and 12 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 The increase in iGaming revenue of 6 and 9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, was driven primarily by continued momentum in the North American and European markets as well as strong content launches.

 Cost of Revenue 
 Total cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased as a direct result of higher revenue as described above, driven by 29 million and 59 million, respectively, in higher cost of products revenue primarily associated with higher gaming machine sales. Total cost of services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was relatively flat compared to the prior year period, while the total cost of services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3 million due to higher cost of services correlated with SciPlay and iGaming segments revenue growth. 
 SG A 
 SG A increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year periods. The increase was driven by higher salaries and benefits, excluding stock-based compensation, of 13 million and 32 million, 
 31 

respectively, and higher marketing expenses primarily associated with the SciPlay segment of 7 million and 22 million, respectively. 
 R D 
 R D increased for both periods, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits in our Gaming and SciPlay segments. 
 D A 
 D A for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily due to fully amortized intangible assets related to certain of our legacy trade names associated with our Gaming segment. Additionally, the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included an impairment charge of 5 million related to SciPlay restructuring of a certain foreign studio. 
 Restructuring and Other 
 The increases in restructuring and other for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to 34 million and 66 million, respectively, associated with charges related to certain legal matters, which were partially offset by lower professional services and other costs related to strategic review and related transactions. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 3 million in costs associated with the SciPlay Merger, and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 7 million in professional services associated with the ASX listing.

 Current Year Update 
 The increase in Gaming revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was primarily driven by continued global Gaming machine sales growth of 38 and 33 , respectively, coupled with Gaming Operations growth of 5 and 4 , respectively, driven by growth in U.S. and Canada installed base and higher average daily revenue per unit. The increase in Gaming revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also benefited from Systems growth, which increased 8 . Our growth is driven by the continued strength and success of our diversified portfolio of successful game franchises, including HUFF N PUFF , ULTIMATE FIRE LINK , INVADERS! ATTACK FROM THE PLANET MOOLAH , FRANKENSTEIN TM , our hit Asian-themed games 88 FORTUNES and DANCING DRUMS , stepper favorites QUICK HIT and BLAZING 777 , and the success of our COSMIC and KASCADA cabinets. While demand remains strong, we are actively monitoring any impact of inflationary pressures and macroeconomic uncertainty that may impact our operations. We are also monitoring for any potential disruptions in our supply chain, such as those due to armed conflicts or hostilities, and we increase our inventory positions when deemed necessary to mitigate any expected or unexpected delays and fulfill customer orders timely. On September 23, 2024, we received an order from the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada granting Aristocrat a preliminary injunction on future sales and distribution of our Dragon Train -themed games. We are executing a number of key initiatives to mitigate the immediate impact and any continuing business disruption from this order, as described in the Business Overview section above.

 Gaming Operations 
 Gaming operations revenue growth was driven by strong game performance of hit franchises, including our premium games. Gaming operations for U.S. and Canada had a 2,116-unit increase in installed base for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, along with an increase in average daily revenue per unit of 0.41 and 1.40 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Average daily revenue per unit for International units increased by 1.10 and 0.21 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. International ending installed base units decreased by 1,016 units primarily due to the expected closure of certain LBOs in the U.K., removals in Greece, and the reduction of certain low-yielding units in Latin America. 
 Gaming Machine Sales 
 Gaming machine sales revenue increased primarily due to higher sales of replacement units globally as operator capital spending remained at healthy levels and casino opening and expansion activity increased internationally.

 Operating Expenses and AEBITDA 
 Operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 44 million and 58 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods, primarily due to 28 million and 55 million, respectively, in higher costs of revenue associated with the increase in revenue as described above, 6 million and 25 million, respectively, in higher SG A, and 9 million and 18 million respectively, in higher R D. Increases in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were offset by decreases in D A of 32 million. 
 AEBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year periods, increased by 32 million and 98 million, respectively, which is primarily related to increased revenue. AEBITDA as a percentage of revenue AEBITDA margin decreased by 1 percentage point to 50 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and remained at 50 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 SCIPLAY 
 Our SciPlay business segment is a leading developer and publisher of digital games on mobile and web platforms. SciPlay operates primarily in the social gaming market, which is characterized by gameplay online or on mobile devices that is social, competitive and self-directed in pace and session length. SciPlay also operates in the hyper-casual space, which is characterized by simpler core loops and more repetitive gameplay than casual games. SciPlay generates a substantial portion of its revenue from in-app purchases in the form of coins, chips and cards, which players can use to play slot games, table games or bingo games. Players who install SciPlay s social games typically receive free coins, chips or cards upon the initial launch of the game and additional free coins, chips or cards at specific time intervals. Players may exhaust the coins, chips or cards that they receive for free and may choose to purchase additional coins, chips or cards in order to enhance gameplay. Once obtained, coins, chips and cards (either free or purchased) cannot be redeemed for cash nor exchanged for anything other than game play within SciPlay s apps. SciPlay generates additional revenue through advertising arrangements in SciPlay s hyper-casual games, which was not material for the periods presented. Players who install SciPlay s hyper-casual games receive free, unlimited gameplay that requires viewing of periodic in-game advertisements. 
 SciPlay currently offers a variety of social casino games, including JACKPOT PARTY Casino, QUICK HIT Slots, GOLD FISH Casino, 88 FORTUNES Slots, MONOPOLY Slots and HOT SHOT CASINO . SciPlay continues to pursue its strategy of expanding into the online and mobile games market. Current casual game titles include BINGO SHOWDOWN and BACKGAMMON LIVE as well as other titles in the hyper-casual space, including games such as CANDY CHALLENGE 3D , BOSS LIFE and DEEP CLEAN INC. 3D . SciPlay continually develops and tests various new games. SciPlay s social casino games typically include slots-style game play and occasionally include table games-style game play, while its casual games blend solitaire-style or bingo game play with adventure game features and its hyper-casual games include many simple core loop mechanics. All of SciPlay s games are offered and played across multiple platforms, including APPLE, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, AMAZON and MICROSOFT . SciPlay launched a proprietary direct-to-consumer in-app purchase platform during 2023, with the goals of improving players experience and reducing costs of revenue given the lower payment processing fees and other related expenses for in-app purchases made through the proprietary platform, as compared to the platform fee charged by third-party platforms. Revenue generated via the proprietary direct-to-consumer platform continues to increase and represented approximately 10 of total SciPlay revenue for the first nine months of 2024. In addition to original game content, SciPlay s content library includes recognizable game content across our other platforms within Gaming and iGaming. This content allows players who like playing land-based game content to enjoy some of those same titles in SciPlay s free-to-play games.

Current Year Update 
 SciPlay continues to deliver strong results and elevated payer engagement. Revenue growth was 5 and 8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which was primarily attributable to the revenue generated by Quick Hit Slots, Jackpot Party Casino , 88 Fortunes and Gold Fish Casino . SciPlay continues to deploy strategic game updates, utilize enhanced analytics, pursue international expansion and benefit from the proprietary direct-to-consumer platform. 
 We have a significant portion of SciPlay personnel located in Tel Aviv, Israel. In light of current circumstances in Israel, we are actively monitoring developments and are ready to redirect resources as needed to minimize impact on SciPlay operations. We do not have servers or infrastructure that are located in Israel that host our games. While we have not yet seen an impact on our business from current events, they could negatively affect the performance of the personnel in that area and have an adverse impact on our business if these events continue and/or escalate.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue increased as average monthly revenue per paying user increased 6 and 12 , respectively, while social casino payer engagement remained elevated. 
 Mobile penetration decreased by 11 and 10 percentage points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily reflecting growing revenue generated via our proprietary direct-to-consumer platform, with a majority of players continuing to use mobile platforms to play SciPlay s games. 
 Average MAU and average MPU for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased due to the turnover in users. ARPDAU increased as a function of higher player monetization with a slight decrease in average DAU. AMRPPU increased, with payer conversion remaining relatively constant, as SciPlay continues to improve content and features resulting in increased paying player interaction. 
 Payer conversion rates continue to be at high levels due to consistent payer interaction with the games as a result of SciPlay s focus on introducing new content, features and live events in games. 
 Operating Expenses and AEBITDA 
 The increase in operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to prior year periods, was primarily driven by higher marketing spend of 6 million and 19 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, higher salaries and benefit costs (including stock-based compensation) of 8 million related to an increase in headcount, partially offset by lower restructuring and other of 4 million and lower D A of 4 million. 
 AEBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to prior year periods by 5 million and 24 million, respectively, and AEBITDA margin increased by 1 percentage point to 32 and 2 percentage points to 32 , respectively, primarily due to revenue growth, as discussed above, including growth from our proprietary direct-to-consumer platform which generates higher margin, partially offset by the increase in operating costs resulting from increases in marketing spend and salaries and benefits.

iGAMING 
 Our iGaming business segment provides a comprehensive suite of digital gaming content, distribution platforms and player account management systems, as well as various other iGaming content and services. The majority of our revenue is derived from casino-style game content, including a wide variety of internally developed and branded games as well as popular third-party provider games. These games are made available to iGaming operators via content aggregation platforms, including Open Gaming System, remote gaming servers and various other platforms. We also provide our Open Platform System, a player account management system which offers a wide range of reporting and administrative functions and tools providing operators full control over all areas of digital gaming operations. Generally, we host the play of our game content which is integrated with the online casino operators websites. 
 Current Year Update 
 We continue to expand our customer base and capitalize on growth in the North American and European markets by leveraging our industry leading platforms, content and solutions, as well as investing in our ability to scale our own original U.S. land-based content offering. In the second quarter of 2024, we went live in Rhode Island, increasing our U.S. presence to seven states, and we are well positioned to enter additional states as their legislatures authorize online gaming. 
 Results of Operations 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 The increases in iGaming revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 6 and 9 , respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The prior year periods also benefited from 3 million and 5 million, respectively, in license termination fees, which impacted revenue growth by 4 and 2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The momentum in the international and U.S. markets remain strong due to our original content and growth in our partner network. Wagers processed through our Open Gaming System for both current year periods increased to 22.8 billion and 67.0 billion, respectively. 
 Operating expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to higher costs of revenue, correlated with the increase in revenue described above, and SG A totaling 4 million and 15 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, partially offset by lower restructuring and other costs as compared to the prior year periods, including the fair value adjustment of contingent acquisition considerations of 10 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 AEBITDA decreased slightly and increased slightly for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. AEBITDA margin decreased to 32 and 33 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to continuing investments in growth initiatives. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, AEBITDA benefited from 3 million and 5 million, respectively, in license termination fees, which impacted AEBITDA growth by 12 and 7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE 
 We do not expect that any recently issued accounting guidance will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements.

 There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimate policies or the application of those policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements from those presented in Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 10-K. 

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND WORKING CAPITAL 
 Cash and Available Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity, other than cash flows provided by operating activities, were cash and cash equivalents as well as amounts available under the LNWI Revolver. 
 Cash and Available Revolver Capacity 
 As of (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 347 425 Revolver capacity 750 750 Revolver capacity drawn or committed letters of credit (10) (10) Total 1,087 1,165 
 Total cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was 143 million and 166 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We believe that substantially all cash held outside the U.S. is free from legal encumbrances or similar restrictions that would prevent it from being available to meet our global liquidity needs. 
 Our Gaming operations generally require significant upfront capital expenditures, and we may need to incur additional capital expenditures in order to retain or increase market share and continue our product investments. Other capital requirements for the near term primarily include debt principal and interest payments and also include purchase obligations and supply contracts, license agreement minimum guaranteed payments and lease obligations. For certain Dragon Train game sales in which control of the units have transferred to a customer, but the title transfer is pending until the final payment, we have elected to designate future collections as restricted cash until the resolution of the Aristocrat legal matter. The outstanding balance associated with these arrangements as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 40 million. There have been no material changes to our capital requirements disclosed in our 2023 10-K, other than those associated with our repricing of the LNWI Term Loan B, as described below and in Note 10. 
 Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and other obligations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. We may, from time to time, repurchase or otherwise repay, retire or refinance our debt, through our subsidiaries or otherwise. In the event we pursue significant acquisitions or other expansion opportunities, or conduct significant repurchases of our outstanding securities, we may need to raise additional capital. If we do not have adequate liquidity to support these activities, we may be unable to obtain financing for these cash needs on favorable terms or at all. For additional information regarding our cash needs and related risks, see Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A in our 2023 10-K. 
 On June 11, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time to time through June 12, 2027, up to an aggregate amount of 1.0 billion of shares of our outstanding common stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 45 million (including excise tax). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 221 million (including excise tax), of which 0.4 million shares with an aggregate cost of 45 million were under the new June 2024 share repurchase program. 
 On January 16, 2024 and July 17, 2024, we amended the LNWI Credit Agreement and reduced the applicable margin on the LNWI Term Loan B. Following the July 2024 amendment, the interest rate for the Term Loan B is either (i) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the LNWI Credit Agreement) plus 2.25 per annum or (ii) a base rate plus 1.25 per annum.

 430 423 7 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to a 35 million increase in earnings (drivers of which are described above), mostly offset by changes in working capital accounts. Changes in working capital accounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were negatively impacted by the timing of collection of receivables as well as 13 million in higher payments on contingent acquisition considerations. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to higher capital expenditures in order to support Gaming operations growth. Capital expenditures are composed of investments in systems, equipment and other assets related to contracts, property and equipment, intangible assets and software. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased, as more purchases of our outstanding common stock under our share repurchase programs and increases in net redemptions of common stock under stock-based compensation plans during the current year period were partially offset by lower payments related to long-term debt and licenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 219 million and 145 million, respectively, of our common stock. 
 
 Credit Agreement and Other Debt 
 For additional information regarding the LNWI Credit Agreement and other debt, interest rate risk and interest rate hedging instruments, see Notes 15 and 16 and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 10-K as well as Notes 10 and 11 and Item 3 below in this Form 10-Q. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The following describes our financial instruments which expose us to market risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, the face value of long-term debt was 3.9 billion, including 2.2 billion of variable rate obligations that fluctuate based on SOFR. Assuming a constant outstanding balance for our variable-rate long-term debt and excluding the impact of interest rate swap contracts, a hypothetical 1 change in interest rates would result in interest expense 
 40 

changing by approximately 22 million. All of our interest rate sensitive financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading. 
 In April 2022, we entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of our interest expense associated with our variable rate debt and effectively fix the interest rate that we pay. The objective of our interest rate swap contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges of the future interest payments, is to eliminate the variability of cash flows attributable to the SOFR component of interest expense to be paid on a portion of our variable rate debt. These hedges mature in April 2027. 
 For additional information regarding our long-term debt and interest rate swap contracts, see Notes 10 and 11, respectively. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 3a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 For discussion of our legal proceedings, see Note 15, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 20 in our 2023 10-K. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed under Item 1A Risk Factors included in our 2023 10-K, except as noted below. 
 The intellectual property rights of others, including our competitors, may prevent us from developing new products and services, entering new markets or may expose us to liability or costly litigation. 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to continually adapt our products and systems to incorporate new technologies and to expand into markets that may be created by new technologies. If technologies are protected by the intellectual property rights of our competitors or other third parties, we may be prevented from introducing products based on these technologies or expanding into markets created by these technologies. If the intellectual property rights of others prevent us from taking advantage of innovative technologies, our prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 We cannot assure that our business activities, games, products, services and systems will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, or that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us. In addition to infringement claims, third parties may allege claims of invalidity or unenforceability against us or against our licensees or manufacturers in connection with their use of our technology. A successful challenge to, or invalidation of, one of our intellectual property interests, a successful claim of infringement by a third party against us, our products or services, or one of our licensees in connection with the use of our technologies, or an unsuccessful claim of infringement made by us against a third party or its products or services could adversely affect our business or cause us financial harm. Any such claim and any resulting litigation, such as the Dragon Train litigation described under Aristocrat Matter in Note 15, could: 
 be expensive and time-consuming to defend or require us to pay significant amounts in damages; 
 invalidate our proprietary rights; 
 cause us to cease making, licensing or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; 
 require us to redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products or services or limit our ability to bring new products and services to the market in the future; 
 require us to enter into costly or burdensome royalty, licensing or settlement agreements in order to obtain or retain the right to use a product, process or component; 
 impact the commercial viability of the products and services that are the subject of the claim during the pendency of such claim; 
 impact our brand, reputation and/or ability to attract and retain key personnel; and/or 
 41 

require us by way of injunction to remove products or services on lease or stop selling or leasing new products or services.
