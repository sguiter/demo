 to and extended the maturity date of the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program to July 21, 2025. Additionally, the Sixth Amendment provides for the replacement of LIBOR-based interest rate mechanics with Term SOFR based interest rate mechanics for the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. 
 As of September 30, 2024 there was outstanding aggregate borrowings under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. Lamar Media had additional availability for borrowing under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program as of September 30, 2024. The commitment fees based on the amount of unused commitments under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program were during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Accounts Receivable Securitization Program was set to mature on July 21, 2025, but was subsequently extended to October 15, 2027 by the Seventh Amendment to the Receivables Financing Agreement dated October 15, 2024; provided, that, if on the date (a Securitization Springing Maturity Test Date that is days prior to the then scheduled maturity date of Lamar Media s Term Loan B loans (which is currently February 6, 2027), (a) any of the outstanding Term B loans has a scheduled maturity date prior to the date that is 91 days prior to the then scheduled maturity date of Lamar Media s revolving credit facility (which is currently July 31, 2028) and (b) the Company and its restricted subsidiaries do not have sufficient liquidity (defined as (i) unused commitments under the revolving credit facility plus (ii) unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries plus (iii) borrowing availability under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program) to repay in full the aggregate outstanding amount (including all accrued and unpaid interest, premiums and make-whole amounts (if any)) of the Term Loan B loans, then the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program will mature on such Securitization Springing Maturity Test Date. Lamar Media may amend the facility to further extend the maturity date, enter into a new securitization facility with a different maturity date, or refinance the indebtedness outstanding under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program using borrowings under its senior credit facility or from other financing sources. 
 The Accounts Receivable Securitization Program is accounted for as a collateralized financing activity, rather than a sale of assets, and therefore: (i) accounts receivable balances pledged as collateral are presented as assets and the borrowings are presented as liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, (ii) our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income reflect the associated charges for bad debt expense (a component of general and administrative expenses) related to the pledged accounts receivable and interest expense associated with the collateralized borrowings and (iii) receipts from customers related to the underlying accounts receivable are reflected as operating cash flows and borrowings and repayments under the collateralized loans are reflected as financing cash flows within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties described in the section of this combined report on Form 10-Q entitled Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and in Item 1A to the 2023 Combined Form 10-K filed on February 23, 2024, and as such risk factors as further updated or supplemented, from time to time, in our combined Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. You should carefully consider each of these risks and uncertainties in evaluating the Company s and Lamar Media s financial conditions and results of operations. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this document. These statements speak only as of the date of this document, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the statements, except as may be required by law. 
 
 LAMAR ADVERTISING COMPANY 
 The following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and the related notes thereto. 
 Overview 
 The Company s net revenues are derived primarily from the rental of advertising space on outdoor advertising displays owned and operated by the Company. Revenue growth is based on many factors that include the Company s ability to increase occupancy of its existing advertising displays; raise advertising rates; and acquire new advertising displays and its operating results are therefore affected by general economic conditions, as well as trends in the advertising industry. Advertising spending is particularly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions which affect the rates that the Company is able to charge for advertising on its displays and its ability to maximize advertising sales or occupancy on its displays. 
 Acquisitions and capital expenditures 
 Historically, the Company has made strategic acquisitions of outdoor advertising assets to increase the number of outdoor advertising displays it operates in existing and new markets. The Company continues to evaluate and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise. The Company has financed its historical acquisitions and intends to finance any future acquisition activity from available cash, borrowings under its senior credit facility or the issuance of debt or equity securities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources- Sources of Cash for more information. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed multiple acquisitions for a total cash purchase price of approximately 31.1 million. See Uses of Cash Acquisitions for more information. The Company s business requires expenditures for maintenance and capitalized costs associated with the construction of new billboard displays, the entrance into and renewal of logo sign and transit contracts, and the purchase of real estate and operating equipment. The following table presents a breakdown of capitalized expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total capital expenditures: Billboard traditional 7,472 11,658 18,485 40,619 Billboard digital 14,703 18,057 39,311 59,598 Logos 3,108 2,368 6,244 9,499 Transit 358 1,001 1,743 2,390 Land and buildings 1,268 2,094 5,948 9,785 Operating equipment 3,231 3,967 10,539 10,261 Total capital expenditures 30,140 39,145 82,270 132,152

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Our management reviews our performance by focusing on several key performance indicators not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States GAAP ). We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted EBITDA ), Funds From Operations FFO ), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Adjusted Funds From Operations AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue. 
 We define adjusted EBITDA as net income before income tax expense (benefit), interest expense (income), equity in (earnings) loss of investee, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt and investments, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, loss (gain) on disposition of assets and investments, transaction expenses and capitalized contract fulfillment costs, net. 
 FFO is defined as net income before (gain) loss from the sale or disposal of real estate assets and investments, net of tax, and real estate related depreciation and amortization and including adjustments to eliminate unconsolidated affiliates and non-controlling interest. 
 We define AFFO as FFO before (i) straight-line income and expense; (ii) capitalized contract fulfillment costs, net (iii) stock-based compensation expense; (iv) non-cash portion of tax expense (benefit); (v) non-real estate related depreciation and amortization; (vi) amortization of deferred financing costs; (vii) loss on extinguishment of debt; (viii) transaction expenses; (ix) non-recurring infrequent or unusual losses (gains); (x) less maintenance capital expenditures; and (xi) an adjustment for unconsolidated affiliates and non-controlling interest. 
 Acquisition-adjusted net revenue adjusts our net revenue for the prior period by adding to it the net revenue generated by the acquired assets before our acquisition of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the current period. In calculating acquisition-adjusted revenue, therefore, we include revenue generated by assets that we did not own in the period but acquired in the current period. We refer to the amount of pre-acquisition revenue generated by the acquired assets during the prior period that corresponds with the current period in which we owned the assets (to the extent within the period to which this report relates) as acquisition net revenue . In addition, we also adjust the prior period to subtract revenue generated by the assets that have been divested since the prior period and, therefore, no revenue derived from those assets is reflected in the current period. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision-making and for evaluating our core operating results; (2) adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the industry to measure operating performance as depreciation and amortization may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (3) acquisition-adjusted net revenue is a supplement to net revenue to enable investors to compare period-over-period results on a more consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions and divestitures, which reflects our core performance and organic growth (if any) during the period in which the assets were owned and managed by us; (4) adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO each provide investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (5) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies. 
 Our measurement of adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included herein.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net revenues increased 72.5 million or 4.7 to 1.63 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.56 billion for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in billboard net revenues of 59.4 million and an increase in transit net revenues of 12.1 million over the same period in 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a 66.2 million increase in net revenues as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which represents an increase of 4.2 . See "Reconciliations" below. The 66.2 million increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase of 52.6 million in billboard net revenues as well as an increase in transit net revenues of 12.6 million over the same period in 2023. 
 Total operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on disposition of assets, increased 56.4 million, or 6.6 , to 910.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 853.7 million for the same period in 2023. The 56.4 million increase over the prior year is comprised of a 35.1 million increase in total direct, general and administrative and corporate expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) primarily related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets, as well as a 21.4 million increase in stock-based compensation. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 4.6 million to 227.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 222.9 million for the same period in 2023, primarily related to acquisitions and capital expenditures completed in the last twelve months. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a gain on disposition of assets of 5.5 million primarily resulting from transactions related to the sale of real estate and billboard locations and displays. 
 Due to the above factors, operating income increased by 11.7 million to 495.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 483.7 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Interest expense increased 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 131.8 million as compared to 130.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Equity in earnings of investee was 2.1 million and 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The increase in operating income resulted in a 10.8 million increase in income before income tax (benefit) expense. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.9 , which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items. 
 As a result of the above factors, the Company recognized net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 363.9 million, as compared to net income of 347.5 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Reconciliations: 
 Because acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2022 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2023 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2023 net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net revenues increased 21.5 million or 4.0 to 564.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 542.6 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in billboard net revenues of 18.3 million and an increase in transit net revenues of 2.9 million over the same period in 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was a 19.7 million increase in net revenues as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which represents an increase of 3.6 . See "Reconciliations" below. The 19.7 million increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase of 16.7 million in billboard net revenues as well as an increase in transit net revenues of 2.8 million over the same period in 2023. 
 Total operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on disposition of assets, increased 24.2 million, or 8.6 , to 304.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 280.7 million for the same period in 2023. The 24.2 million increase over the prior year is comprised of a 16.0 million increase in total direct, general and administrative and corporate expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) primarily related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets, as well as a 8.2 million increase in stock-based compensation.

Table of Contents 

 Interest expense decreased 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 42.9 million as compared to 45.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the decrease in interest rates on the senior credit facility and Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. 
 Equity in earnings of investee was 2.6 million and 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The decrease in operating income, offset by the decrease in interest expense and increase in equity in earnings of investee, resulted in a 2.4 million increase in income before income tax (benefit) expense. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was (0.8) , which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Overview 
 The Company has historically satisfied its working capital requirements with cash from operations and borrowings under the senior credit facility. The Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Lamar Media Corp., is the borrower under the senior credit facility and maintains all corporate operating cash balances. Any cash requirements of the Company, therefore, must be funded by distributions from Lamar Media. 
 Sources of Cash 
 Total Liquidity. As of September 30, 2024 we had 450.7 million of total liquidity, which is comprised of 29.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and 421.2 million of availability under the revolving portion of Lamar Media s senior credit facility. We expect our total liquidity to be adequate for the Company to meet its operational requirements for the next twelve months. We are currently in compliance with the maintenance covenant included in the senior credit facility and we would remain in compliance after giving effect to borrowing the full amount available to us under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a working capital deficit of 326.4 million and 340.7 million, respectively. The decrease in working capital deficit of 14.3 million is primarily due to an increase in receivables, offset by an increase in deferred income. 
 Cash Generated by Operations . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our cash provided by operating activities was 594.3 million and 529.4 million, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the same period in 2023 primarily relates to an increase in revenue of 72.5 million, offset by an increase in operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation, gain on disposition of assets, and depreciation and amortization) of 35.1 million. We expect to generate cash flows from operations during 2024 in excess of our cash needs for operations, capital expenditures and dividends, as described herein. We believe we have sufficient liquidity available under our revolving credit facility to meet our operating cash needs for the next twelve months. 
 Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. On June 24, 2022, Lamar Media and the Special Purpose Subsidiaries entered into the Sixth Amendment (the "Sixth Amendment") to the Receivables Financing Agreement. The Sixth Amendment increased the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program from 175.0 million to 250.0 million and extended the maturity date of the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program to July 21, 2025. Additionally, the Sixth Amendment provides for the replacement of LIBOR-based interest rate mechanics with Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("Term SOFR") based interest rate mechanics for the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. 
 
 Borrowing capacity under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program is limited to the availability of eligible accounts receivable collateralizing the borrowings under the agreements governing the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. In connection with the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, Lamar Media and certain of its subsidiaries (such subsidiaries, the Subsidiary Originators sell and/or contribute their existing and future accounts receivable and certain related assets to one of two special purpose subsidiaries, Lamar QRS Receivables, LLC (the QRS SPV and Lamar TRS Receivables, LLC (the TRS SPV and together with the QRS SPV the Special Purpose Subsidiaries ), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lamar Media. Existing and future accounts receivable relating to Lamar Media and its qualified REIT subsidiaries will be sold and/or contributed to the QRS SPV and existing and future accounts receivable relating to Lamar Media s Taxable REIT Subsidiaries ("TRSs") will be sold and/or contributed to the TRS SPV. Each of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries has granted the lenders party to the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program a security interest in all of its assets, which consist of the accounts receivable and related assets sold or contributed to them, as described above, in order to secure the obligations of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries under the agreements governing the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. Pursuant to the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, Lamar Media has agreed to service the accounts receivable on behalf of the two Special Purpose Subsidiaries for a fee. Lamar Media has also agreed to guaranty its performance in its capacity as servicer and originator, as well as the performance of the Subsidiary Originators, of their obligations under the agreements governing the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. None of Lamar Media, the Subsidiary Originators or the Special Purpose Subsidiaries guarantees the collectability of the receivables under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. In addition, each of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled to access the assets of such Special Purpose Subsidiary before the assets become available to Lamar Media. Accordingly, the assets of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries are not available to pay creditors of Lamar Media or any of its subsidiaries, although collections from receivables in excess of the amounts required to repay the lenders and the other creditors of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries may be remitted to Lamar Media.

 As of September 30, 2024, there was 249.8 million in outstanding aggregate borrowings under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. Lamar Media had no additional availability under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Accounts Receivable Securitization Program was set to mature on July 21, 2025, but was subsequently extended to October 15, 2027 by the Seventh Amendment to the Receivables Financing Agreement dated October 15, 2024; provided, that, if on the date (a Securitization Springing Maturity Test Date that is 91 days prior to the then scheduled maturity date of Lamar Media s Term Loan B loans (which is currently February 6, 2027), (a) any of the outstanding Term B loans has a scheduled maturity date prior to the date that is 91 days prior to the then scheduled maturity date of Lamar Media s revolving credit facility (which is currently July 31, 2028) and (b) the Company and its restricted subsidiaries do not have sufficient liquidity (defined as (i) unused commitments under the revolving credit facility plus (ii) unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries plus (iii) borrowing availability under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program) to repay in full the aggregate outstanding amount (including all accrued and unpaid interest, premiums and make-whole amounts (if any)) of the Term Loan B loans, then the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program will mature on such Securitization Springing Maturity Test Date. Lamar Media may amend the facility to further extend the maturity date, enter into a new securitization facility with a different maturity date, or refinance the indebtedness outstanding under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program using borrowings under its senior credit facility or from other financing sources. 
 At-the-Market Offering Program. On July 24, 2024, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement, or At-the-Market Offering agreement, (the "2024 Sales Agreement"), with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Truist Securities, Inc., SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. as our sales agents (each a "Sales Agent", and collectively, the "Sales Agents"), which replaced the prior Sales Agreement with substantially similar terms (the "2021 Sales Agreement". Under the terms of the 2024 Sales Agreement, the Company may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of its Class A common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 400.0 million through the Sales Agents as either agents or principals. Sales of the Class A common stock, if any, may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be "at-the-market offerings" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on or through the Nasdaq Global Select Market and any other existing trading market for the Class A common stock, or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange. The Company has no obligation to sell any of the Class A common stock under the 2024 Sales Agreement and may at any time suspend solicitations and offers under the 2024 Sales Agreement. The Company intends to use the net proceeds, if any, from the sale of the Class A common stock pursuant to the 2024 Sales Agreement for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment, refinancing, redemption or repurchase of existing indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisition of outdoor advertising assets and businesses and other related investments. The Company did not issue any shares under this program during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company did not issue any shares under the 2021 Sales Agreement from inception through expiration. 
 Shelf Registration Statement . On June 21, 2021, the Company filed a new automatically effective shelf registration statement that allows Lamar Advertising to offer and sell an indeterminate amount of additional shares of its Class A common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not issue any shares under the shelf registration statement. The shelf registration statement expired on June 21, 2024.

 Credit Facilities . On February 6, 2020, Lamar Media entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with certain of Lamar Media s subsidiaries as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto, under which the parties agreed to amend and restate Lamar Media s existing senior credit facility.

 On July 2, 2021, Lamar Media entered into Amendment No. 1 (the "Amendment"), to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Amendment amends the definition of "Subsidiary" to exclude each of Lamar Partnering Sponsor LLC and Lamar Partnering Corporation and any of their subsidiaries (collectively, the Lamar Partnering Entities such that, after the giving effect to the Amendment, none of the Lamar Partnering Entities are subject to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement covenants and reporting requirements, but any investment by Lamar Media in any of the Lamar Partnering Entities would be subject to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement covenants. The Amendment also amends the definition of EBITDA to replace the existing calculation with a net income-based calculation, which excludes the income of non-Subsidiary entities such as the Lamar Partnering Entities, except to the extent that income of such entities is received by Lamar Media in the form of dividends or distributions. 
 The senior credit facility, as established by the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the senior credit facility ), consists of (i) a 750.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility which will mature on July 31, 2028, subject to certain conditions (see description of Amendment No. 4 below) (the revolving credit facility ), (ii) a 600.0 million senior secured Term B loan facility (the Term B loans which will mature on February 6, 2027, and (iii) an incremental facility (the Incremental Facility pursuant to which Lamar Media may incur additional term loan tranches or increase its revolving credit facility subject to a pro forma secured debt ratio calculated as described under Restrictions under Senior Credit Facility of 4.50 to 1.00, as well as certain other conditions including lender approval. Lamar Media borrowed all 600.0 million in Term B loans on February 6, 2020. The entire amount of the Term B loans will be payable at maturity. 
 The Term B loans bear interest at rates based on Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 (Term SOFR plus such credit spread adjustment, the "Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or the Adjusted Base Rate, at Lamar Media s option. Term B loans bearing interest at a rate based on Term SOFR bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus 1.50 .

Base Rate revolving loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Base Rate plus 0.50 (or the Adjusted Base Rate plus 0.25 at any time the total debt ratio is less than or equal to 3.25 to 1). The guarantees, covenants, events of default and other terms of the senior credit facility apply to the Term B loans and revolving credit facility. 
 On July 29, 2022, Lamar Media entered into Amendment No. 2 ("Amendment No. 2") to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with certain of Lamar Media's subsidiaries as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto. Amendment No. 2 established the Term A loans as a new class of incremental term loans. The Term A loans were set to mature on February 6, 2025 and bore interest based on Term SOFR ("Term SOFR Term A loans") or the Adjusted Base Rate ("Base Rate Term A loans"), at Lamar Media's option. Term SOFR Term A loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus 1.50 (or the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus 1.25 at any time the Total Debt Ratio is less than or equal to 3.25 to 1). Base Rate Term A loans bore interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Base Rate plus 0.50 (or the Adjusted Base Rate plus 0.25 at any time the total debt ratio is less than or equal to 3.25 to 1). The covenants, events of default and other terms of the senior credit facility apply to the Term A loans. Lamar Media borrowed all 350.0 million in Term A loans on July 29, 2022. Proceeds from the Term A loans were used to repay outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility and a portion of the outstanding balance on our Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. The Term A loans were subsequently repaid in full on July 31, 2024. 
 On April 26, 2023, Lamar Media entered into Amendment No. 3 ("Amendment No. 3") to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with certain of Lamar Media's subsidiaries as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto. Amendment No. 3 replaced the London Interbank Offered Rates as administered by the ICE Benchmark Administration with Term SOFR as the successor rate, as set in the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. All other material terms and conditions of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement remain unchanged by Amendment No. 3.

 On July 31, 2023, Lamar Media entered into Amendment No. 4 (the Amendment No. 4 ), to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with certain of Lamar Media s subsidiaries as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto. Amendment No. 4 extends the maturity date of Lamar Media s 750.0 million revolving credit facility such that the revolving credit facility matures July 31, 2028; provided, that, if on the date (a "Springing Maturity Test Date") that is 91 days prior to either the then scheduled maturity date of Lamar Media s Term B loans (which is currently February 6, 2027) or the February 15, 2028 maturity date of Lamar Media s 3 3/4 Notes, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries do not have sufficient liquidity (defined as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries plus unused commitments under the revolving credit facility) to repay in full the aggregate outstanding amount (including all accrued and unpaid interest, premiums and make-whole amounts (if any)) of the Term B loans or the 3 3/4 Notes (as applicable), the revolving credit facility will mature on such Springing Maturity Test Date. On the maturity date of the revolving credit facility, the entire principal amount of revolving loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility, together with all accrued and unpaid interest on such revolving loans, will be due and payable. 
 
 Amendment No. 4 also establishes a 75.0 million swingline as a sublimit of the revolving credit facility, which allows Lamar Media to borrow revolving loans on a same-day basis, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to 75.0 million. In addition, Amendment No. 4 amends the provisions of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement related to incremental facilities to allow Lamar Media to establish, from time to time, one or more new incremental revolving facilities on the terms, and subject to the conditions, set forth therein. 
 As of September 30, 2024 the aggregate balance outstanding under the senior credit facility was 920.0 million, consisting of 600.0 million in Term B loans aggregate principal balance and 320.0 million outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Lamar Media had approximately 421.2 million of unused capacity under the revolving credit facility. 
 Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity 
 Internally Generated Funds. The key factors affecting internally generated cash flow are general economic conditions, specific economic conditions in the markets where the Company conducts its business and overall spending on advertising by advertisers. We expect to generate cash flows from operations during 2024 in excess of our cash needs for operations, capital expenditures and dividends, as described herein, and we believe we have sufficient liquidity with cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility to meet our operating cash needs for the next twelve months. 
 Credit Facilities and Other Debt Securities. The Company and Lamar Media must comply with certain covenants and restrictions related to the senior credit facility, its outstanding debt securities and its Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. 
 Lamar Media's outstanding Term A loans were set to mature on February 6, 2025. On July 31, 2024, Lamar Media paid in full its 350.0 million in Term A loans outstanding under its Senior Credit facility. The repayment of the Term A loans was completed using a combination of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. 
 Restrictions Under Debt Securities. The Company and Lamar Media must comply with certain covenants and restrictions related to its outstanding debt securities. Currently, Lamar Media has outstanding the 600.0 million 3 3/4 Senior Notes issued February 2020, the 550.0 million 4 Senior Notes issued February 2020 and August 2020, the 400.0 million 4 7/8 Senior Notes issued in May 2020 and the 550.0 million 3 5/8 Senior Notes issued in January 2021. 
 The indentures relating to Lamar Media s outstanding notes restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness, but permit the incurrence of indebtedness (including indebtedness under the senior credit facility), (i) if no default or event of default would result from such incurrence and (ii) if after giving effect to any such incurrence, the leverage ratio (defined as the sum of (x) total consolidated debt plus (y) the aggregate liquidation preference of any preferred stock of Lamar Media s restricted subsidiaries to trailing four fiscal quarter EBITDA (as defined in the indentures)) would be less than 7.0 to 1.0. Currently, Lamar Media is not in default under the indentures of any of its outstanding notes and, therefore, would be permitted to incur additional indebtedness subject to the foregoing provision. 
 In addition to debt incurred under the provisions described in the preceding paragraph, the indentures relating to Lamar Media s outstanding notes permit Lamar Media to incur indebtedness pursuant to the following baskets: 
 up to 2.0 billion of indebtedness under the senior credit facility; 
 indebtedness outstanding on the date of the indentures or debt incurred to refinance outstanding debt; 
 inter-company debt between Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries or between restricted subsidiaries;

At September 30, 2024 we were, and currently, we are, in compliance with all such tests under the senior credit facility. 
 Lamar Media must maintain a secured debt ratio, defined as total consolidated secured debt of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries (including capital lease obligations), minus the lesser of (x) 150.0 million and (y) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries (other than the Special Purpose Subsidiaries (as defined above under Sources of Cash Accounts Receivable Securitization Program )) to EBITDA, as defined below, for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, of less than or equal to 4.5 to 1.0. 
 Lamar Media is restricted from incurring additional indebtedness subject to exceptions, one of which is that it may incur additional indebtedness not exceeding the greater of 250.0 million or 6 of its total assets. 
 Lamar Media is also restricted from incurring additional unsecured senior indebtedness under certain circumstances unless, after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness, Lamar Media would have a total debt ratio, defined as (a) total consolidated debt (including subordinated debt) of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries as of any date minus the lesser of (i) 150.0 million and (ii) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries (other than the Special Purpose Subsidiaries) to (b) EBITDA, as defined below, for the most recent four fiscal quarters then ended, is less than 7.0 to 1.0. 
 Lamar Media is also restricted from incurring additional subordinated indebtedness under certain circumstances unless, after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness, it is in compliance with the secured debt ratio covenant and its total debt ratio is less than 7.0 to 1.0.

For purposes of this EBITDA definition, the effect thereon of any adjustments required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R will be excluded. If during any period for which EBITDA is being determined, we have consummated any acquisition or disposition, EBITDA will be determined on a pro forma basis as if such acquisition or disposition had been made or consummated on the first day of such period.

 The Company believes that its current level of cash on hand, availability under the senior credit facility and future cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet its operating needs for the next twelve months. All debt obligations are reflected on the Company s balance sheet. 
 Restrictions under Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. The agreements governing the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and termination event provisions, including but not limited to those providing for the acceleration of amounts owed under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program if, among other things, the Special Purpose Subsidiaries fail to make payments when due, Lamar Media, the Subsidiary Originators or the Special Purpose Subsidiaries become insolvent or subject to bankruptcy proceedings or certain judicial judgments, breach certain representations and warranties or covenants or default under other material indebtedness, a change of control occurs, or if Lamar Media fails to maintain the maximum secured debt ratio of 4.5 to 1.0 required under Lamar Media s senior credit facility.

 Cash flows used in investing activities decreased 137.9 million from 245.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 108.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to a net decrease in the amount of assets acquired through acquisitions and capital expenditures of 139.1 million, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 The Company's cash flows used in financing activities were 501.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 296.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 LAMAR MEDIA CORP. 
 The following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Lamar Media for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Lamar Media and the related notes thereto. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net revenues increased 72.5 million or 4.7 to 1.63 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.56 billion for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in billboard net revenues of 59.4 million and an increase in transit net revenues of 12.1 million over the same period in 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a 66.2 million increase in net revenues as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which represents an increase of 4.2 . See "Reconciliations" below. The 66.2 million increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase of 52.6 million in billboard net revenues as well as an increase in transit net revenues of 12.6 million over the same period in 2023. 
 Total operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on disposition of assets, increased 56.4 million, or 6.6 , to 909.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 853.3 million for the same period in 2023. The 56.4 million increase over the prior year is comprised of a 35.0 million increase in total direct, general and administrative and corporate expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) primarily related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets, as well as a 21.4 million increase in stock-based compensation. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 4.6 million to 227.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 222.9 million for the same period in 2023, primarily related to acquisitions and capital expenditures completed in the last twelve months. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Lamar Media recognized a gain on disposition of assets of 5.5 million, primarily resulting from transactions related to the sale of real estate and billboard locations and displays. 
 Due to the above factors, operating income increased by 11.7 million to 495.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 484.1 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Interest expense increased 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 131.8 million as compared to 130.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 Equity in earnings of investee was 2.1 million and 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The increase in operating income, offset by the increase in interest expense, resulted in a 10.9 million increase in income before income tax (benefit) expense. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.9 , which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items. 
 As a result of the above factors, Lamar Media recognized net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 364.3 million, as compared to net income of 347.9 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Reconciliations: 
 Because acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2022 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2023 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2023 net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Reconciliations of 2023 reported net revenue to 2023 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, as well as a comparison of 2023 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2024 reported net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, are provided below:

 Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5.2 to 755.1 million. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to an increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and capitalized contract fulfillment costs, net) of 46.1 million offset by an increase in total general and administrative and corporate expenses of 8.9 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.

AFFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 8.3 to 592.9 million as compared to 547.6 million for the same period in 2023.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net revenues increased 21.5 million or 4.0 to 564.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 542.6 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in billboard net revenues of 18.3 million and an increase in transit net revenues of 2.9 million over the same period in 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was a 19.7 million increase in net revenues as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which represents an increase of 3.6 . See "Reconciliations" below. The 19.7 million increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase of 16.7 million in billboard net revenues as well as an increase in transit net revenues of 2.8 million over the same period in 2023. 
 Total operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on disposition of assets, increased 24.2 million, or 8.6 , to 304.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 280.6 million for the same period in 2023.

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 0.5 million to 75.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 74.6 million for the same period in 2023, primarily related to acquisitions and capital expenditures completed in the last twelve months. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Lamar Media recognized a gain on disposition of assets of 2.5 million, primarily resulting from transactions related to the sale of real estate and billboard locations and displays. 
 Due to the above factors, operating income decreased by 1.6 million to 186.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 188.3 million for the same period in 2023.

 Interest expense decreased 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 42.9 million as compared to 45.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the decrease in interest rates on the senior credit facility and Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. 
 Equity in earnings of investee was 2.6 million and 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The decrease in operating income, offset by the decrease in interest expense and increase in equity in earnings of investee, resulted in a 2.4 million increase in income before income tax (benefit) expense. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was (0.8) , which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items. 
 As a result of the above factors, Lamar Media recognized net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 147.9 million, as compared to net income of 140.6 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Reconciliations: 
 Because acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2022 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2023 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2023 net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Reconciliations of 2023 reported net revenue to 2023 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the three months ended September 30, as well as a comparison of 2023 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2024 reported net revenue for the three months ended September 30, are provided below:

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Lamar Advertising Company and Lamar Media Corp. 
 Lamar Advertising is exposed to interest rate risk in connection with variable rate debt instruments issued by its wholly owned subsidiary Lamar Media. The information below summarizes the Company s interest rate risk associated with its principal variable rate debt instruments outstanding at September 30, 2024, and should be read in conjunction with Note 10 of the Notes to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Lamar Media has variable-rate debt outstanding under its senior credit facility and its Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. Because interest rates may increase or decrease at any time, the Company is exposed to market risk as a result of the impact that changes in interest rates may have on the applicable borrowings outstanding. Increases in the interest rates applicable to these borrowings would result in increased interest expense and a reduction in the Company s net income. 
 At September 30, 2024 there was approximately 1.17 billion of indebtedness outstanding under the senior credit facility and the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, or approximately 35.8 of the Company s outstanding long-term debt on that date, bearing interest at variable rates. The aggregate interest expense for 2024 with respect to borrowings under the senior credit facility and the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program was 62.6 million, and the weighted average interest rate applicable to these borrowings during 2024 was 6.7 . Assuming that the weighted average interest rate was 200 basis points higher (that is 8.7 rather than 6.7 ), then the Company s 2024 interest expense would have increased by approximately 18.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Company attempts to mitigate the interest rate risk resulting from its variable interest rate long-term debt instruments by issuing fixed rate long-term debt instruments and maintaining a balance over time between the amount of the Company s variable rate and fixed rate indebtedness. In addition, the Company has the capability under the senior credit facility to fix the interest rates applicable to its borrowings at an amount equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as applicable), or Adjusted Base Rate plus the applicable margin for periods of up to twelve months (in certain cases with the consent of the lenders), which would allow the Company to mitigate the impact of short-term fluctuations in market interest rates. In the event of an increase in interest rates, the Company may take further actions to mitigate its exposure. The Company cannot guarantee, however, that the actions that it may take to mitigate this risk will be feasible or that, if these actions are taken, that they will be effective. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 a) Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 The Company s and Lamar Media s management, with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company and Lamar Media, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s and Lamar Media s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company and Lamar Media concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the Company s and Lamar Media s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods. 
 b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
 There have been no changes in the internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) of the Company and Lamar Media identified in connection with the evaluation of the Company s and Lamar Media s internal control performed during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s and Lamar Media s internal control over financial reporting.
