Deferred product revenue represents unrecognized revenue related to undelivered product commitments and other product deliveries that have not met all revenue recognition criteria. Deferred services revenue represents customer payments made in advance for services, which include software and hardware support contracts, certain public cloud services and other services. Financed unearned services revenue represents undelivered services for which cash has been received under certain third-party financing arrangements. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies for additional information related to these arrangements. During the six months ended October 25, 2024 and October 27, 2023, we recognized revenue of million and million, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue balance at the beginning of the respective periods. Remaining performance obligations As of October 25, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations related to customer contracts that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied was billion. Because customer orders are typically placed on an as-needed basis, and cancellable without penalty prior to shipment, orders in backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue and have not been included in this amount. We expect to recognize as revenue approximately of our remaining performance obligations in the next months and the remainder thereafter. Deferred commissions

Our Level 2 debt instruments are held by a custodian who prices some of the investments using standard inputs in various asset price models or obtains investment prices from third-party pricing providers that incorporate standard inputs in various asset price models. These pricing providers utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs like market transactions involving identical or comparable securities. We review Level 2 inputs and fair value for reasonableness and the values may be further validated by comparison to multiple independent pricing sources. In addition, we review third-party pricing provider models, key inputs and assumptions and understand the pricing processes at our third-party providers in determining the overall reasonableness of the fair value of our Level 2 debt instruments. As of October 25, 2024 and April 26, 2024, we have not made any adjustments to the prices obtained from our third-party pricing providers. Fair Value of Debt As of October 25, 2024 and April 26, 2024, the fair value of our long-term debt, which includes the current portion of long-term debt, was approximately million and million, respectively. The fair value of our long-term debt was based on observable market prices in a less active market.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the Senior Notes under specified terms. The Senior Notes also include covenants that limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens on assets or on shares of stock or indebtedness of our subsidiaries; to engage in certain sale and lease-back transactions; and to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

Commercial Paper Program and Credit Facility We have a commercial paper program (the Program ), under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes. Amounts available under the Program, as amended in July 2017, may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed billion. The maturities of the notes can vary, but may not exceed days from the date of issue. The notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used for general corporate purposes. There were commercial paper notes outstanding as of October 25, 2024 or April 26, 2024. In connection with the Program, we have a senior unsecured credit agreement with a syndicated group of lenders. The credit agreement, which was amended in May 2023, provides for a billion revolving unsecured credit facility, with a sublimit of million available for the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf. The credit facility matures on , with an option for us to extend the maturity date for additional -year periods, subject to certain conditions. The proceeds of the loans may be used by us for general corporate purposes and as liquidity support for our existing commercial paper program. As of October 25, 2024, we were compliant with all associated covenants in the agreement. amounts were drawn against this credit facility during any of the periods presented.

In the six months ended October 25, 2024, we granted PBRSUs to certain of our executives. Each PBRSU has performance-based vesting criteria (in addition to the service-based vesting criteria) such that the PBRSUs cliff-vest at the end of a performance period, which began on the date specified in the grant agreements and typically ends on the last day of the third fiscal year, following the grant date. The number of shares that will be used to calculate the settlement amount for all of these PBRSUs at the end of the applicable performance and service period will range from to of a target number of shares originally granted. For half of the PBRSUs granted in the six months ended October 25, 2024, the number of shares used to calculate the settlement amount will depend upon our Total Stockholder Return (TSR) as compared to the TSR of a specified group of benchmark peer companies (each expressed as a growth rate percentage) calculated as of the end of the performance period.

The activities under these plans were initiated during the first six months of fiscal 2025 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2025. Charges related to these plans consist primarily of employee severance-related costs. In the first six months of fiscal 2024, management executed a restructuring plan to redirect resources to highest return activities, and to optimize our global office space for our hybrid work model. In connection with the plan, we reduced our global workforce by approximately and terminated certain real estate leases in various countries, resulting in restructuring charges comprised primarily of employee severance related expenses and lease termination charges. The activities under the plan were substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2024.

Balance at end of period 

Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of a significant amount of earnings being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates below the United States (U.S.) statutory rate. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended October 25, 2024 includes an increase in discrete tax benefits related to stock compensation compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended October 27, 2023 included benefits for fiscal 2023 foreign tax credits resulting from legislative guidance for that period, partially offset by an increase in stock compensation for which no tax benefit is recorded. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD recently enacted model rules for a new global minimum tax framework known as Pillar Two. These rules have been agreed to by most OECD members. The OECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of Pillar Two rules. On February 1, 2023, the FASB indicated that they believe taxes imposed under Pillar Two is an alternative minimum tax. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the minimum tax would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated future effects of the minimum tax but would be recognized in the period incurred. We are currently subject to Pillar Two rules starting in our fiscal year 2025. As of October 25, 2024, Pillar Two taxes do not have a significant impact on our financial statements, particularly due to the safe harbor relief during the transition period, but we are still closely monitoring developments. Any OECD actions adopted internationally could impact our financial results in future periods. We are currently undergoing various income tax audits in the U.S. and audits in several foreign tax jurisdictions. Transfer pricing calculations are key topics under these audits and are often subject to dispute and appeals. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We engage in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in multiple jurisdictions. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude, certain statutes of limitations will lapse, or both. As a result of uncertainties regarding tax audits and their possible outcomes, an estimate of the range of possible impacts to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months cannot be made at this time. As of October 25, 2024, we had million of gross unrecognized tax benefits. Inclusive of penalties, interest and certain income tax benefits, million would affect our provision for income taxes if recognized. Net unrecognized tax benefits of million have been recorded in other long-term liabilities.

 segments: Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud. The two segments are based on the information reviewed by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is the Chief Executive Officer, to evaluate results and allocate resources. The CODM measures performance of each segment based on segment revenue and segment gross profit. We do not allocate to our segments certain cost of revenues which we manage at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We do not allocate assets to our segments. Hybrid Cloud offers a unified data storage portfolio of storage management and infrastructure solutions that help customers modernize their data centers. This portfolio supports structured and unstructured data with unified storage optimized for flash, disk, and cloud storage to handle data-intensive workloads and applications. Hybrid Cloud is composed of software, hardware, and related support, as well as professional and other services. Public Cloud offers a portfolio of products delivered primarily as-a-service, including related support. This portfolio includes cloud storage and CloudOps services.

billion in non-cancelable purchase commitments for inventory. We record a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of October 25, 2024 and April 26, 2024, such liability amounted to million and million, respectively, and is included in accrued expenses in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. To the extent that such forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change. In addition to inventory commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers, we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not yet received goods or services. As of October 25, 2024, we had approximately billion in other purchase obligations. Financing Guarantees While most of our arrangements for sales include short-term payment terms, from time to time we provide long-term financing to creditworthy customers. We have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts dates of execution, and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as true sales as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize product revenues for these arrangements, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions, upon product acceptance. We sold million and million of receivables during the six months ended October 25, 2024 and October 27, 2023, respectively. In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery to the end-user customer, if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through third-party financing institutions. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. These arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases and collectability is probable, we account for these transactions as sales type leases. If collectability is not probable, the cash received is recorded as a deposit liability and revenue is deferred until the arrangement is deemed collectible. For leases that we are not a party to, other than providing recourse, we recognize revenue when control is transferred. As of October 25, 2024 and April 26, 2024, the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant. To date, we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements. We have entered into service contracts with certain of our end-user customers that are supported by third-party financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of our non-performance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid financing payments under such arrangements. As of October 25, 2024, we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements, and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make material payments under these arrangements is remote. The portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our condensed consolidated balance sheets . Legal Contingencies When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business. We may, from time to time, receive claims that we are infringing third parties intellectual property rights, including claims for alleged patent infringement brought by non-practicing entities. We are currently involved in patent litigation brought by non-practicing entities and other third parties. We believe we have strong arguments that our products do not infringe and/or the asserted patents are invalid, and we intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs claims. However, there is no guarantee that we will prevail at trial and if a jury were to find that our products infringe, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages, and may cause product shipment delays or stoppages, require us to redesign our products, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.

 Stock Repurchase and Dividend Activity 
 During the first six months of fiscal 2025, we repurchased approximately 5.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 121.58 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of 700 million. We also declared aggregate cash dividends of 1.04 per share in that period, for which we paid 213 million. 
 Restructuring Events 
 In the first six months of fiscal 2025, we approved restructuring plans to redirect resources to highest return activities and reduce costs. Aggregate charges recorded from the restructuring plans during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 totaled 12 million and 29 million, respectively. 
 Results of Operations 
 Our fiscal year is reported as a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Friday in April. Fiscal years 2025 and 2024, ending on April 25, 2025 and April 26, 2024, respectively, are each 52-week years, with 13 weeks in each of their quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company s fiscal years ended in April and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years .

Hybrid Cloud 
 In prior periods, we presented the hardware and software components of our GAAP product revenues to illustrate the significance and value of the Company s software. Because our revenue recognition policy under GAAP defines a configured storage system, inclusive of the operating system software essential to its functionality, as a single performance obligation, hardware and software components of our product revenues are considered non-GAAP measures. Effective in fiscal 2025, we are no longer presenting the non-GAAP hardware and software components of our product revenues, as management no longer considers them to be key financial measures. The Company s current strategy is expected to deliver investor value through growth in total revenues, including product revenues, while maintaining operational discipline to drive earnings leverage. While software continues to be the primary value driver of our products, NetApp is primarily focused on driving growth in total product revenues, through the sale of configured storage systems comprised of both hardware and software, with less focus on the pricing of each component. Additionally, the Company is considering potential opportunities to simplify pricing for certain products in the future, which may eliminate the existence of separate prices for hardware and software components and/or impact our ability to allocate between them. 
 28 

Product revenues are derived through the sale of our Hybrid Cloud solutions and consist of sales of configured all-flash array systems (including All-Flash FAS A-Series and All-Flash FAS C-Series with capacity flash) and hybrid systems, which are bundled hardware and software products, as well as add-on flash, disk and/or hybrid storage and related OS, StorageGrid, OEM products, NetApp HCI and add-on optional software . 
 Total product revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year due to higher sales of C-Series all-flash array systems.

Hybrid Cloud 
 Hybrid Cloud services revenues are derived from the sale of: (1) support, which includes both hardware and software support contracts (the latter of which entitle customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements, bug fixes and patch releases), and (2) professional and other services, which include customer education and training. 
 Support revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year as a result of a higher aggregate support contract value for our installed base. 
 Professional and other services revenues increased by 8 million and 13 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year. 
 Public Cloud 
 Public Cloud revenues are derived from the sale of public cloud offerings delivered primarily as-a-service, which include cloud storage and CloudOps services. 
 Public Cloud revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, due to higher customer demand, driven by NetApp s diversified cloud offerings and an overall growth in the cloud market. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Our cost of revenues consists of: 
 (1) cost of product revenues, composed of (a) cost of Hybrid Cloud product revenues, which includes the costs of manufacturing and shipping our products, inventory write-downs, and warranty costs, and (b) unallocated cost of product revenues, which includes stock-based compensation, and; 
 (2) cost of services revenues, composed of (a) cost of support revenues, which includes the costs of providing support activities for hardware and software support, global support partnership programs, and third party royalty costs, (b) cost of professional and other services revenues, (c) cost of public cloud revenues, constituting the cost of providing our Public Cloud offerings, which includes depreciation and amortization expense and third party datacenter fees, and (d) unallocated cost of services revenues, which includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles.

 Cost of Hybrid Cloud services revenues, which are composed of the costs of support and professional and other services, increased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2024. Cost of Hybrid Cloud services revenues represented approximately 16 of Hybrid Cloud services revenues for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 16 and 15 , respectively, for the corresponding periods of fiscal 2024. 
 Hybrid Cloud support gross margins were relatively flat in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year. Hybrid Cloud professional and other services gross margins increased by approximately two percentage points in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024 due to the mix of services provided.

 Public Cloud 
 Cost of Public Cloud revenues decreased in each the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025. Public Cloud gross margins increased by eight percentage points and six percentage points, respectively, in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2024. The decrease in cost of Public Cloud revenues and improved gross margins was due to cost optimization that included a decrease in fixed assets depreciation, and the mix of offerings provided.

Operating Expenses 
 Sales and Marketing, Research and Development and General and Administrative Expenses 
 Sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 totaled 819 million, or 49 of net revenues, and 1,617 million, or 51 of net revenues, respectively, each reflecting a decrease of two percentage points compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the increase in net revenues. 
 Compensation costs represent the largest component of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Included in compensation costs are salaries, benefits, other compensation-related costs, stock-based compensation expense and employee incentive compensation plan costs. 
 Total compensation costs included in sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025, were relatively flat compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year.

In the first six months of fiscal 2025, management approved restructuring plans to redirect resources to highest return activities and reduce costs, which included a reduction of our global workforce by approximately 2 . Charges related to the plans consisted primarily of employee severance-related costs. The activities under the plans are expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2025. 
 In the first six months of fiscal 2024, management executed a restructuring plan to redirect resources to highest return activities, and to optimize our global office space for our hybrid work model. In connection with the plan, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 1 and terminated certain real estate leases in various countries, resulting in restructuring charges comprised primarily of employee severance-related expenses and lease termination charges. The activities under the plan were substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2024.

 Interest income increased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, primarily due to higher yields earned on our cash and investments.

Our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended October 25, 2024 includes an increase in discrete tax benefits related to stock compensation compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended October 27, 2023 included a benefit for increased fiscal 2023 foreign tax credits resulting from legislative guidance for those periods partially offset by an increase in stock compensation for which no tax benefit is recorded. 
 As of October 25, 2024, we had 223 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits. Inclusive of penalties, interest and certain income tax benefits, 162 million would affect our provision for income taxes if recognized. Net unrecognized tax benefits of 161 million have been recorded in other long-term liabilities.

Cash Flows 
 As of October 25, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were 2.2 billion, which represents a decrease of 1.0 billion during the first six months of fiscal 2025. The decrease was primarily due to 700 million used for the repurchase of our common stock, a 400 million principal repayment of our 3.30 Senior Notes due September 2024, 213 million used for the payment of dividends, 132 million used for payment of taxes related to net share settlement of stock awards and 86 million used for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by 446 million provided by operating activities. Our net working capital deficit was 378 million as of October 25, 2024, a reduction of 1.2 billion when compared to April 26, 2024, primarily due to the decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments discussed above and the reclassification of 750 million principal amount of our Senior Notes from long-term to current liabilities. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 During the first six months of fiscal 2025, we generated cash from operating activities of 446 million, reflecting net income of 547 million which was adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of 126 million and non-cash stock-based compensation expense of 188 million, compared to 588 million of cash generated from operating activities during the first six months of fiscal 2024. 
 Significant changes in assets and liabilities in the first six months of fiscal 2025 included the following: 
 Accounts receivable decreased 138 million, reflecting lower billings in the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the last six months of fiscal 2024. 

Inventory increased by 132 million, primarily due to higher raw materials purchases. 

Deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue decreased by 164 million, due to a decrease in deferred revenue for software and hardware support contracts. 

We expect that cash provided by operating activities may materially fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, shipping linearity, accounts receivable collections performance, inventory and supply chain management, vendor payment initiatives, and the timing and amount of compensation, income taxes and other payments. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 During the first six months of fiscal 2025, we generated 597 million from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases and paid 86 million for capital expenditures, as compared to the same period of fiscal 2024, in which we generated 72 million from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases, and paid 73 million for capital expenditures. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 During the first six months of fiscal 2025, cash flows used in financing activities totaled 1.4 billion and included 700 million for the repurchase of approximately 6 million shares of common stock, 400 million principal repayment upon maturity of our 3.30 Senior Notes due in September 2024 and 213 million for the payment of dividends. During the first six months of fiscal 2024, cash flows used in financing activities totaled 942 million and included 700 million for the repurchase of approximately 9 million shares of common stock and 209 million for the payment of dividends. 
 33 

Key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability, our ability to effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories, the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, our ability to effectively integrate acquired products, businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt. Based on past performance and our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and our ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements. We cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all. For further discussion of factors that could affect our cash flows and liquidity requirements, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Liquidity 
 Our principal sources of liquidity as of October 25, 2024 consisted of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash we expect to generate from operations, and our commercial paper program and related credit facility. 
 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consisted of the following (in millions):

As of October 25, 2024 and April 26, 2024, 1.9 billion and 2.1 billion, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings, while 0.3 billion and 1.2 billion, respectively, were available in the U.S. 
 Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, fund research and development, meet capital expenditure needs, invest in critical or complementary technologies through asset purchases and/or business acquisitions, service interest and principal payments on our debt, fund our stock repurchase program, and pay dividends, as and if declared. In the ordinary course of business, we engage in periodic reviews of opportunities to invest in or acquire companies or units in companies to expand our total addressable market, leverage technological synergies and establish new streams of revenue, particularly in our Public Cloud segment. 
 The principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. We attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counter-parties and underlying obligors closely. We believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of October 25, 2024. 
 Our investment portfolio has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets. We continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio. We routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt, equity and other securities.

Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually. For further information on the underlying terms, see Note 6 Financing Arrangements of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1. 
 On September 30, 2024, upon maturity, we repaid our 3.30 Senior Notes due September 2024 for an aggregate amount of 407 million, comprised of the principal and unpaid interest. 
 Commercial Paper Program and Credit Facility 
 We have a commercial paper program (the Program ), under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes. Amounts available under the Program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed 1.0 billion. The maturities of the notes can vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used for general corporate purposes. No commercial paper notes were outstanding as of October 25, 2024. 
 In connection with the Program, we have a senior unsecured credit agreement with a syndicated group of lenders. The credit agreement, which was amended in May 2023, provides for a 1.0 billion revolving unsecured credit facility, with a sublimit of 50 million available for the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf. The credit facility matures on January 22, 2026, with an option for us to extend the maturity date for two additional 1-year periods, subject to certain conditions. The proceeds of the loans may be used by us for general corporate purposes and as liquidity support for our existing commercial paper program. As of October 25, 2024, we were compliant with all associated covenants in the agreement. No amounts were drawn against this credit facility during any of the periods presented. 
 Capital Expenditure Requirements 
 We expect to fund our capital expenditures, including our commitments related to facilities, equipment, operating leases and internal-use software development projects over the next few years through existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors, including future demand for products, changes in the network storage industry, hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements. We anticipate capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal 2025 to be between 50 million and 100 million. 
 Transition Tax Payments 
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 imposed a mandatory, one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits that had not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. As of October 25, 2024, the outstanding payment related to the transition tax is estimated to be approximately 100 million which is expected to be paid during fiscal 2026. Our estimates for future transition tax payments, however, could change with further guidance or review from U.S. federal and state tax authorities or other regulatory bodies. 
 Dividends and Stock Repurchase Program 
 On November 19, 2024, we declared a cash dividend of 0.52 per share of common stock, payable on January 22, 2025, to holders of record as of the close of business on January 3, 2025. 
 In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 1.0 billion of our common stock. As of October 25, 2024, our Board of Directors had authorized cumulative repurchases of up to 17.1 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. Under this program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Since the May 13, 2003 inception of this program through October 25, 2024, we repurchased a total of 377 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 43.25 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of 16.3 billion. As of October 25, 2024, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was 0.8 billion. 
 Purchase Commitments 
 In the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties, to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not yet received goods or services. These off-balance sheet purchase commitments totaled approximately 0.9 billion at October 25, 2024.

Financing Guarantees

These arrangements and related financing guarantees are described in Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1.

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The phrase disclosure controls and procedures refers to controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of October 25, 2024, the end of the fiscal period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Evaluation Date). Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with our evaluation that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
