information or future events. 

Although we believe that the expectations, estimates and projections
reflected in the forward-looking statements in this report are based on reasonable assumptions when they were made, we cannot assure you
that these expectations, estimates and projections will be achieved. We believe the forward-looking statements in this report are reasonable;
however, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement, as they are based on current expectations. Future events
and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from our expectations are discussed Item 1A. Risk Factors beginning on page seven of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Overview 

In this quarterly report we refer to US Lighting Group, Inc. and its
subsidiaries as USLG, the company, we and our, unless the context requires otherwise. 

We are an innovative composite manufacturer utilizing advanced fiberglass
technologies in growth sectors such as high-end recreational vehicles (RVs), prefabricated off-grid houses, high-performance powerboats,
and automotive aftermarket body parts. We derive expertise and inspiration from the marine industry, where the harshest conditions are
expected and met with superior engineering and the latest in composite technology. Molded fiberglass products are exceptionally strong,
lightweight and durable. Composite materials are also corrosion resistant and provide efficient insulation, making them attractive for
both outdoor enthusiasts and residential housing needs. Molded construction allows for the creation of irregular, unusual or circular
objects, which permits the innovative shapes and features of our products. In 2023 and 2024, our revenue was driven by shipments of fiberglass
campers marketed under Cortes Campers brand. 

Cortes Campers, LLC designs and manufactures high-end molded fiberglass
RV travel trailers and campers designed for comfort, style and durability. We utilize superior quality materials and fiberglass construction
resulting in significantly stronger, more durable and lighter weight products. Cortes Campers first product was a 17-foot-long
single axle tow-behind molded fiberglass camper. During the third quarter of 2024, we fully transitioned our production from the previous
Cortes 16 and Cortes 17 models to the 2025 model year Cortes 18 with improved weight savings and featuring a fully integrated molded composite
frame. We continued to develop additional tooling and floorplans for our Cortes 22 model, a lightweight composite camper designed for
families or couples looking for additional space. We are currently taking orders for the Cortes 18 and 22 for delivery this year and in
2025. We expect to launch the Cortes 27, our composite 27-foot trailer with a unique aerodynamic design, in 2025. Originally slated for
launch during the fourth quarter of 2024, we have pushed the timeline back to ensure the highest quality product. 

10 

Cortes Campers has established a network of professional RV dealerships
to market and distribute its products. As of September 30, 2024, Cortes Campers are available through 35 dealer locations in US and Canada.
In states without dealer representation, we have begun selling directly to consumers. Additionally, Cortes Campers has seen increasing
inquiries about private label manufacturing and custom fiberglass products, potentially further diversifying our business opportunities. 

Cortes Campers made a strong impression at the 2024 Hershey RV Show,
held from September 11 15, 2024. In collaboration with Liberty RV of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, we showcased our lightweight fiberglass
travel trailers to nearly 48,000 attendees. The response was overwhelmingly positive, with many visitors expressing interest in purchasing
one of our campers, and Liberty RV continues to engage with potential buyers from the event. 

Recognizing that we could utilize many of the same technologies and
manufacturing processes we have perfected for the Cortes Campers line of RVs to make small, prefabricated homes, we began exploring the
market in early 2022. The international tiny-house movement has gained new relevance in the recent years as the quest for off-grid, rugged,
prefabricated homes has entered the mainstream and was further fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic. We named our modular housing line Futuro
Houses after the Futuro Pod, the iconic UFO house designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen, of which fewer than one
hundred were built during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Our first home design is an update of the original Futuro utilizing modular
construction and fiberglass for structural integrity and energy efficiency and designed to address modern residential requirements in
a 600-square-foot living space. The Futuro can also serve as a commercial structure as it is currently available as a shell kit 
to be outfitted by consumers to meet their needs. We exhibited the Futuro house at the Cleveland Home Remodeling Expo in March 2023,
signed our first distributor in New York, and sold our first home in May 2023. Interest in the Futuro home continues to grow, with inquiries
coming in from around the globe from both direct buyers and potential dealers. Since launching Futuro Houses we have added two additional
tiny house designs, the FH200 and FH300, ranging from more traditional to futuristic, and from 200 to 300 square feet. 

In early 2021, we formed Fusion X Marine, LLC to design, manufacture
and distribute high-performance speed boats utilizing advanced fiberglass composites. Our first boat model is the X-15, a miniature speed
boat designed for rental sites and excursions, as well as to serve as an entry-level boat for first time buyers. We began producing the
X-15 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and made our first deliveries in the first quarter of 2024. The similarly styled X-27 is a 27-foot
fiberglass V-hull speedboat and is designed for speed and superior maneuverability. The tooling and molds for the X-27 are currently under
development and the model is not yet available for pre-orders. 

On October 6, 2023, we formed Fusion X Automotive, LLC to design, manufacture
and distribute automotive aftermarket composite products, specializing in high-performance fiberglass and carbon-fiber hoods, scoops and
cowls. We received our first Fusion X Automotive order in the second quarter of this year from one of the largest US automotive aftermarket
distributors and started fulfilling these orders in October 2024. We are currently exploring making direct to consumer sales online. Fusion
X Auto will showcase its products at the 2024 Performance Racing Industry Show in Indianapolis, Indiana, from December 12 14, 2024. 

We plan to expand our manufacturing footprint, enhance production techniques,
and develop more products in the RV, marine and composite housing sectors. Our current R D efforts are focused on future tow-behind
camper models under Cortes Campers brand. 

Our headquarters, manufacturing and research and development facilities
are located at 1148 East 222nd Street, Euclid, Ohio, 44117. Our website is www.USLightingGroup.com.

Subsequent Events 

On November 12, 2024, the United States Patent and Trademark Office
granted to the company s founder Paul Spivak a patent for an integrally molded recreational vehicle body (Patent No. US 12,139,060
B2). Cortes Campers has exclusive access to this technology, which yields significant weight decreases while providing improved structural
integrity, and is currently being used in the Cortes 18 and 22 models and will also be featured in the Cortes 27. 

Corporate Structure and History 

US Lighting Group, Inc. is a holding company with five operating subsidiaries:
Cortes Campers, LLC, high-end campers; Futuro Houses, LLC, molded fiberglass homes; Fusion X Marine, LLC, high-performance boats; Fusion
X Automotive, LLC, automotive aftermarket composite products; and MIGMarine Corporation, composite manufacturing for our business lines. 

The company was originally incorporated in the State of Florida on
October 17, 2003, under the name Luxurious Travel Corp. Initially the company developed hotel booking software, but subsequently exited
that business. On July 13, 2016, we acquired a company named US Lighting Group, Inc. (founded in 2013) and changed our corporate name
to US Lighting Group, Inc. on August 9, 2016. At the time, the company designed and manufactured commercial LED lighting. Ultimately,
we decided to exit the LED lighting market, which was being negatively impacted by inexpensive import products, and enter new business
lines focused on recreational products manufactured from advanced composite materials. 

Financial Results 

During 2023, the Towable RV industry saw a decrease in sales of 38.5 
(RV Industry Association, RV Market Report December 2023). Carrying costs for our dealers have increased significantly due to inflationary
cost increases and the rapid increase in floor plan interest rates. These industry-wide trends led to fewer reorders from our dealer network
in 2024, as our dealers work through their existing inventories, which negatively impacted our results. However, sales by our dealers
have increased, with 44 campers sold in the first nine months of 2024 from dealer inventory stock compared to 17 during the same period
in 2023. We believe these sales from dealer inventory will lead to additional wholesale dealer orders in the beginning of 2025. In addition,
our backlog of units on order has increased from 440,000 on June 30, 2024 to 525,000 on November 11, 2024. 

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30,
2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Sales 

Net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were 151,798, compared
to 755,152 in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 603,354. Net sales decreased primarily as a result of fewer campers sold in 2024
by Cortes Campers, reflecting the ongoing downturn in the industry overall as well as delays in introducing new camper models. 

Cost of Goods Sold 

Cost of goods sold for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were 196,841,
compared to 688,585 for the third quarter of 2023, as a result of lower sales in 2024. 

Operating Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were 247,825 for the
quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 652,467 for the third quarter of 2023, as a result of lower sales in 2024. 

12 

Other Income/Expense 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we had total other expense
of 55,326, compared to 54,935 for the third quarter of 2023. 

Net Loss 

We had a net loss of 338,981 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024,
compared to net loss of 640,835 for the third quarter of 2023, primarily as a result of reduced operating expenses. 

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30,
2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Sales 

Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 517,235,
compared to 3,092,722 for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 2,575,487. Net sales decreased primarily as a result of fewer
campers sold in 2024 by Cortes Campers due to the industry downturn.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023 for a full discussion of our critical accounting policies. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk. 

Because USLG is a smaller reporting company as defined
by the Securities and Exchange Commission we are not required to provide additional market risk disclosure. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under the Securities
Exchange Act, are controls and other procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our principal executive and financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

On September 27, 2024, Joseph Matozzo and Michael A. Coates stepped
down as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively. The decision was a mutual one between Messrs. Matozzo
and Coates and our board of directors. At this time our board has not identified a new CEO or CFO, but is in the process of conducting
a search. In the interim, our board is directly managing the operations of the company. Olga Smirnova, a member of our board and the vice
president of finance and administration, is serving as the company s interim principal financial officer. Ms. Smirnova and
Patricia A. Salaciak, the other member of our board and the director of marketing, are jointly serving in the role of interim principal
executive officer. 

Our management team, with the participation of Mses. Smirnova
and Salaciak, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024.
Based upon this evaluation, Mses. Smirnova and Salaciak concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Our controls were ineffective due to the size of the company and available
resources. There are limited personnel to assist with the accounting and financial reporting function, which results in: (i) a lack
of segregation of duties and (ii) controls that may not be adequately designed or operating effectively. Despite the existence of
material weaknesses, we believe that the financial information presented in this report is materially correct and fairly presents the
financial position and operating results of the company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our senior management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, defined under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision
of, our principal financial and executive officers, and effected by our board, senior management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. We continue to review our internal control over financial reporting and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing
their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business. 

With the exception of the lack of segregation of duties matter disclosed
above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by
the Securities Exchange Act that occurred during our third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

As previously reported, an indictment was filed on September 16, 2021
and unsealed on October 8, 2021 against Paul Spivak, our former chief executive officer and a major shareholder of the company, Mr. Spivak s
wife, Olga Smirnova, our vice president of finance and administration and a member of our board of directors, and others, alleging fraudulent
sales of stock of USLG by Mr. Spivak and others United States of America v. P. Spivak, O. Smirnova, et al. , Case No. L21CR491,
United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division). The events outlined in the indictment allegedly occurred
between June 2016 and June 2021. The alleged acts include issuing favorable press releases to artificially inflate the price of USLG s
stock, selling shares that benefited Mr. Spivak and others while the price was artificially inflated, and paying illegal commissions
to unlicensed brokers to sell USLG s shares. On June 29, 2023, a second superseding indictment was filed in the case naming additional
defendants not affiliated with USLG and making additional allegations against Mr. Spivak, including engaging in a conspiracy to obstruct
justice and making false declarations before the court. USLG was not named in the indictment and is not involved in these legal proceedings. 

On August 12, 2024, in order to avoid the cost of an extended trail,
Ms. Smirnova pled guilty to Count 2 (conspiracy to commit securities fraud), which stems from an FBI sting operation that lasted
from February 2021 to June 2021. The prosecution dismissed the only other charge against Ms. Smirnova. 

The trial against Mr. Spivak began on August 19, 2024 and lasted
for three weeks. It was divided into three phases: (1) 32 counts related to USLG going public and through 2019; (2) counts related
to the FBI sting operation in 2021; and (3) counts related to post-indictment conduct by Mr. Spivak, alleging obstruction of
justice. On September 10, 2024, the jury returned the verdict as to phase one of the trial. They found Mr. Spivak guilty on three
counts of the second superseding indictment Count 1 (conspiracy to commit securities fraud), and Counts 27 and 28 (wire fraud),
stemming from two transactions in 2016 totaling 15,000, in which the company sold restricted stock to HSF Investments. The jury found
Mr. Spivak not guilty on 29 counts of securities fraud and wire fraud: Counts 5 12, 18, 19, 23 26, and 29 43 of
the second superseding indictment. Mr. Spivak was acquitted of all charges related to accepting investor funds and paying commissions
on those investments. After three weeks of trial and having been cleared of the most serious charges in the first phase of the trial,
on September 11, 2024, Mr. Spivak pled guilty to the counts to be addressed in the second phase of the trial: Counts 2, 20, 22, and
44 47 of the second superseding indictment, at which time counts against him reserved for the third phase of the trial were dismissed. 

On November 4, 2024, Mr. Spivak filed a motion for acquittal and
memorandum in support relating to the three counts of which he was convicted. Mr. Spivak has informed us that if his motion is rejected,
then he intends to appeal his convictions. 

There were no other reportable material legal proceedings initiated,
or material events in previously reported legal proceedings, during the third quarter. However, on occasion USLG and our subsidiaries
are subject to other routine litigation incidental to our business. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more
legal matters were resolved against the company, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Please refer to the risk factors listed under Item 1A. Risk Factors 
beginning on page seven of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for information relating to certain risk
factors applicable to USLG. In addition, please see the disclosure in this Form 10-Q under Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
below. 

15 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

On November 2, 2023, USLG issued a promissory note to 1800 Diagonal
Lending LLC 1800 Diagonal in the original principal amount of 120,750 in connection with a loan. We failed to
make the June payment, and on July 2, 2024, 1800 Diagonal elected to convert 10,000 of the amount we owe on the note into 1,024,590 shares
of our unregistered stock at a conversion price of 0.00976 per share. On September 10, 2024, 1800 Diagonal converted an additional 10,000
of the note into 3,278,688 shares of our stock at a conversion price of 0.00305 per share. On October 3, 2024, 1800 Diagonal converted
 15,000 of the note into 5,231,949 shares of stock at a conversion price of 0.002867 per share. These issuances of shares were exempt
from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 

1800 Diagonal 

On November 2, 2023, USLG issued a promissory note to 1800 Diagonal
in the original principal amount of 120,750 in connection with a loan. The note provided for monthly payments of principal and interest
of 15,027. 1800 Diagonal subsequently agreed to reduced payments to 7,500 a month. However, we failed to make the June payment and on
July 2, 2024, 1800 Diagonal elected to convert 10,000 of the amount we owe on the note into shares of our common stock. 1800 Diagonal
called a default under the note due to our failure to make the June payment and applied penalties to the amount outstanding and demanded
payment in full. On September 30, 2024, there was 59,069 outstanding under the note. 

Upon an event of default, 1800 Diagonal may convert amounts outstanding
under the note into shares of our stock at a conversion price equal to 61 of the lowest trading price of the stock during the ten trading
days before the conversion date. For more information about conversion of the 1800 Diagonal note into shares, please see Item 2. Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds above. We do not have available cash to pay the accelerated note balance and expect
that 1800 Diagonal may convert additional amounts under the note into shares of our common stock and sell those shares in the public market,
which may have a negative effect on the trading price of the company s stock. 

Anthony Corpora 

To help address our growth capital needs in 2023, Anthony R. Corpora,
our former chief executive officer, generously volunteered to take out personal loans and make those funds available to the company. On
May 24, 2023, Mr. Corpora obtained a personal loan in the original principal amount of 97,920 from Pinnacle Bank and provided these
funds to us to support the company s operations. Mr. Corpora executed an unsecured promissory note payable to Pinnacle Bank
evidencing the loan in the original principal amount of 97,920, bearing annual interest of 14.49 , and with 84 monthly payments of 1,861.63
commencing on June 25, 2023 with the final payment on May 25, 2030. On July 17, 2023, we entered into an unsecured pass-through 
promissory note with Mr. Corpora that provides for repayment to him on the same terms as his note with Pinnacle Bank, without markup
or profit. We failed to make the June payment to Mr. Corpora, and on July 1, 2024, he provided us with a notice of default and demanded
payment in full of the 89,245 principal and interest remaining outstanding under his note. 

On August 17, 2023, Mr. Corpora obtained an additional personal
loan in the original principal amount of 89,000 from SoFi Bank, N.A. and provided these funds to USLG to support the company s
operations. On August 17, 2023, Mr. Corpora executed a loan agreement with SoFi Bank evidencing the loan, bearing annual interest
of 18.36 , and with 48 monthly payments of 2,631.53 commencing on September 17, 2023 with the final payment on August 17, 2027. On September
29, 2023, we entered into an unsecured pass-through promissory note with Mr. Corpora that provides for repayment to
him on the same terms as his note with SoFi Bank, without markup or profit. We failed to make the July payment to Mr. Corpora, and
on July 19, 2024, he provided us with a notice of default and demanded payment in full of the 75,265 principal and interest remaining
outstanding under his note. 

We do not currently have available cash to pay the accelerated note
balances due Mr. Corpora, although we expect to be able to make payments from operating cash flow in the future.
