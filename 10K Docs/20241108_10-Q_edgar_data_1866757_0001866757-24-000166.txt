 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may be forward-looking statements. Statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations, including, among others, statements regarding expected growth, introduction of new products, future capital expenditures, and debt service obligations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms, such as anticipate, believe, contemplate, continue, could, estimate, evolve, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, seek, should, strategy, target, will, or would, or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. 
 
 We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, but not limited to risks related to: fluctuations in the pricing and supply of diamonds, other gemstones, and precious metals, particularly responsibly sourced natural and lab-grown diamonds and recycled precious metals such as gold; increases in labor costs for manufacturing such as wage rate increases, as well as inflation, and energy prices; risks related to an overall decline in the health of the economy and other factors impacting consumer spending, such as recessionary or inflationary conditions, governmental instability, war and fears of war, and natural disasters; our ability to cost-effectively turn existing customers into repeat customers or to acquire new customers; our rapid growth in recent years and limited operating experience at our current scale of operations; our ability to manage growth effectively; increased lead times, and supply shortages and supply changes; our expansion plans in the United States ("U.S."); our ability to compete in the fine jewelry retail industry; our ability to maintain and enhance our brand and to engage or expand our base of customers may be impaired and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may suffer; our ability to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities and increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our e-commerce and omnichannel approach to shopping for fine jewelry; our profitability and cash flows may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and inventory shrinkage; a decline in sales of Design Your Own rings; our heavy reliance on our information technology systems, as well as those of our third-party vendors and service providers, for our business to effectively operate and to safeguard confidential information and risks related to any significant failure, inadequacy or interruption of these systems, security breaches or loss of data; the impact of environmental, social, and governance matters on our business and reputation; our ability to manage risks related to our e-commerce and omnichannel business; our ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences and shopping patterns, and introduce new products and programs that appeal to new or existing customers; our dependence on distributions from Brilliant Earth, LLC, our principal asset, to pay our taxes and expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement (as defined herein) to Continuing Equity Owners (as defined herein) in respect to certain tax benefits; risks related to our obligations to make substantial cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and risks related to our organizational structure; and the other risks, uncertainties and factors described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 28, 2024. Other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance. 
 
 Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.

 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.

We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise.

 Credit Agreement - Silicon Valley Bank 
 On May 24, 2022, Brilliant Earth, LLC, as borrower, and Silicon Valley Bank ("SVB"), as administrative agent and collateral agent for the lenders, entered into a credit agreement (the "SVB Credit Agreement") which provides for a secured term loan credit facility of million (the "SVB Term Loan") and a secured revolving credit facility in an amount of up to million (the "SVB Revolving Facility," and together with the SVB Term Loan, the "SVB Credit Facilities"). 
 The SVB Credit Facilities are subject to customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants as well as financial maintenance covenants. The financial covenants are tested at the end of each fiscal quarter, and require that (a) the Company and its subsidiaries not have a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined as the ratio of (i) Consolidated EBITDA, less cash taxes (including tax distributions), less certain capital expenditures, less cash dividends and other cash restricted payments, to (ii) the sum of cash interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding debt (in each case, as further defined in the SVB Credit Agreement)) of less than to 1.00, (b) the Company and its subsidiaries not have a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of more than to 1.00, and (c) Brilliant Earth, LLC and its subsidiaries not have a Consolidated Borrower Leverage Ratio (defined substantially similar as Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, but limited to Brilliant Earth, LLC and its subsidiaries) in excess of to 1.00 (which level is subject to temporary increases to to 1.00 in connection with certain acquisitions). 
 On February 21, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the SVB Credit Agreement (the "First Amendment"), pursuant to which the lenders agreed to suspend the requirement to comply with the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant on the last day of the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024. The First Amendment also required us to maintain Balance Sheet Cash (defined as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held in accounts with the lenders and their affiliates) in an amount greater than the sum of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the SVB Revolving Facility (including issued letters of credit) and the aggregate principal amount of the SVB Term Loan outstanding at such time, which requirement applied at all times commencing on February 21, 2024 until the last day of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024. After such time, the minimum Balance Sheet Cash covenant no longer applied.

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 
 Our Ability to Increase Brand Awareness 
 
 Increasing brand awareness and growing favorable brand equity have been and remain key to our growth. We have a significant opportunity to continue to grow our brand awareness, broaden our customer reach, and maximize lifetime value through brand and performance marketing. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments to strengthen the Brilliant Earth brand through our dynamic marketing strategy, which includes brand marketing campaigns across email, digital, social media, earned media, and media placements with key influencers. In order to compete effectively and increase our share of the jewelry market, we must maintain our strong customer experience, produce compelling products, and continue our mission of creating a more transparent, sustainable, compassionate and inclusive jewelry industry. Our performance will also depend on our ability to increase the number of consumers aware of Brilliant Earth and our product assortment. We believe our brand strength will enable 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 us to continue to expand across categories and channels, to deepen relationships with consumers, and to expand our presence in the U.S. and international markets. 
 
 Cost-Effective Acquisition of New Customers and Retention of Existing Customers. 
 
 We have historically had attractive customer acquisition economics, including substantial first order profitability. To continue to grow our business, we must continue to acquire new customers and retain existing customers in a cost-effective manner. The success of our customer acquisition strategy depends on a number of factors, including the level and pattern of consumer spending in the product categories in which we operate, and our ability to cost-effectively drive traffic to our website and showrooms and to convert these visitors to customers. With our strong brand resonance and passionate customer base, we generate significant earned and organic traffic, impressions, and media placements. We continually evolve our dynamic marketing strategies, optimizing our messaging, creative assets, and spending across channels. We also believe our expanded fine jewelry assortment and strategic customer acquisition will continue to drive fine jewelry orders from new customers and repeat orders from existing customers. 
 
 Our Ability to Continue Successfully Growing and Managing our Omnichannel Presence 
 
 Our ability to successfully grow and manage our omnichannel presence in new markets and locations is an important factor to our success. Historically, we have been successful in new geographic markets we have entered, and we have continued to expand our premium showroom footprint nationwide. We intend to continue leveraging our marketing strategy and growing brand awareness to drive increased qualified consumer traffic to and sales from our website and premium showrooms. 
 
 We believe growing and managing our showrooms will drive accelerated growth by increasing our average order value ("AOV") compared to e-commerce orders, improving conversion in the showrooms metro regions compared to pre-opening conversion, and raising our brand awareness. We intend to strategically open showrooms in the future, and we believe we can achieve broad national showroom coverage with far fewer locations than many traditional retailers. We rely on this highly efficient showroom model to complement our digital strategy and to continue to drive growth and profitability. 
 
 Our Ability to Successfully Introduce New Products 
 
 Product expansion allows us significant opportunity to drive new and repeat purchases by expanding purchase occasions beyond engagement and bridal. We intend to leverage our in-house design capabilities and nimble data-driven product development to expand product assortment for special occasions and self-purchase. In addition, we will have more opportunity to enhance and leverage our customer relationship management ("CRM") and data-segmentation capabilities to increase repeat purchases and lifetime value. We have consistently invested in technology to create a seamless customer experience, including dynamic visualization, augmented reality try-on, and automated, rapid fulfillment, and we intend to continue investing in technology to enhance the digital and showroom experience and help drive conversion. Expanding affiliations and brand collaborations will also broaden our existing assortment, reinforce our brand ethos, and feature like-minded designers, which will help to drive both new and repeat purchases.

 International Expansion 
 
 We are in the early stages of expanding globally, and a larger geographic footprint will help drive future growth. Our proof-points from localizing our website for Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, and our sales to customers fr om over 50 countries, pro vide encouraging signs for future global expansion. We see strong potential in launching e-commerce in new overseas markets and new showrooms in countries where we have already established a localized digital presence. We plan to drive brand awareness through localized marketing channels and expect our data-driven technology platform to continue providing insights for product recommendations and inventory management. 
 
 Operational and Marketing Efficiency 
 
 We have a unique, asset-light operating model with attractive working capital dynamics, capital-efficient showrooms, and a vast virtual inventory of premium natural and lab-grown diamonds that allows us to offer a broad selection of diamonds while keeping our balance sheet inventory low. This has driven attractive inventory turns and allows us to operate with negative working capital, which we define as our current assets less cash minus our current liabilities. Our showroom strategy minimizes the inefficiencies of traditional, retail-first jewelers. Our showrooms are primarily appointment-driven with large catchment regions, so we are less reliant on expensive high foot traffic retail locations. Our showroom locations and formats vary from interior, upper floor locations to more recently higher traffic pedestrian and retail mall locations. In all locations, we also curate showroom inventory for scheduled visits and require limited inventory in each location. Our tech-enabled jewelry specialist team can support online customers when not in appointment, increasing workforce utilization. As we continue to scale our business, our future success is dependent on maintaining this capital efficient operating model and driving continued operational improvement as we expand to new locations both in the U.S. and internationally. 
 
 Costs of Operating as a Public Company 
 
 The costs of operating as a public company are significant as we are subject to the reporting, listing, and compliance requirements of various governing bodies and applicable securities laws and regulations. Since becoming a public company, compliance with rules and regulations has increased and may continue to increase our legal, financial, and technology compliance costs, and to make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. Remaining compliant and satisfying our obligations as a public company, while maintaining forecasted gross margins and operating results, and attracting and retaining qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees, or as our executive officers is critical to our future success. 
 
 Macroeconomic Trends 
 
 We believe we are well-positioned at the intersection of key macro-level trends impacting our industry. Consumers are increasingly becoming more conscious of the products they purchase, seeking brands that stand for sustainability, supply chain transparency, and social and environmental responsibility. This has contributed to our strong brand affinity and loyalty, and further differentiates us from our competitors. Consumers are increasingly favoring seamless omnichannel shopping experiences, and we believe our model is well-suited to satisfy these consumer preferences. The current inflationary environment and changes in macro-level consumer spending trends, due to volatile macro-economic conditions could negatively impact our operating results.

 Net Sales 
 
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 14.3 million, or 12.5 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net sales was due to a decrease of 11.6 in AOV and a slight decrease in order volumes of 1.0 .

 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 6.1 million, or 9.1 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin, expressed as a percentage and calculated as gross profit divided by net sales, increased by 230 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by our premium brand and differentiated product offerings, performance of our pricing engine, procurement efficiencies and benefits from our extended warranty program. These improvements in gross margin were slightly offset by a 3.4 increase in average platinum spot prices and a 28.6 increase in average gold spot prices for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

These decreases were partially offset by an increase in employment expenses of 1.7 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2023 to the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The decrease in marketing expenses was a result of our continued focus on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing spend. The decrease in other general and administrative expenses was primarily related to decreases in pre-opening expenses from the opening of new showrooms partially offset by increases in rent, lease-related expenses and increases in information technology and other software-related costs compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in employment expenses was driven by an increase in salaries and wages, payroll taxes and other benefits expense primarily due to the addition of showroom staff to support our growth compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

Key Metrics 
 
 We monitor the key business metrics set forth below to help us evaluate our business and growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. The calculation of the key metrics discussed below may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, securities analysts or investors. 
 
 The following table sets forth our key performance metrics for the periods presented (amounts in thousands, except for total orders and AOV): 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Net Sales 99,873 114,154 (14,281) (12.5) 302,636 322,036 (19,400) (6.0) Total Orders 42,744 43,161 (417) (1.0) 127,673 121,641 6,032 5.0 AOV 2,337 2,645 (308) (11.6) 2,370 2,647 (277) (10.5) 
 
 Total Orders 
 We define total orders as the total number of customer orders delivered less total orders returned in a given period (excluding those repair, resize, and other orders which have no revenue). We view total orders as a key indicator of the velocity of our business and an indication of the desirability of our products to our customers. Total orders, together with AOV, is an indicator of the net sales we expect to recognize in a given period. Total orders may fluctuate based on the number of visitors to our website and showrooms, and our ability to convert these visitors to customers. We believe that total orders is a measure that is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in an analysis of ongoing operating trends. 
 
 Average Order Value 
 We define average order value, or AOV, as net sales in a given period divided by total orders in that period. We believe that AOV is a measure that is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in an analysis of ongoing operating trends. AOV varies depending on the product type and number of items per order. AOV may also fluctuate as we expand into and increase our presence in additional product lines and price points, and open additional showrooms.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with additional useful information in evaluating our performance and liquidity, as applicable, and to more readily compare these financial measures between past and future periods. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. For example, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures, are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because they are used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income excluding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization of cloud-based software implementation costs, showroom pre-opening expense, equity-based compensation expense, certain non-operating expenses and income, and other unusual and/or infrequent costs, which we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA calculated as a percentage of net sales. These non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with useful information in evaluating our operating performance and exclude certain items from net (loss) income that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude from period to period. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for net (loss) income prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net (loss) income and net (loss) income margin, are presented below. We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented. In future periods, we may exclude similar items, may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items, and may include other expenses, costs and non-recurring items.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are for purchases of inventory, payment of operating expenses, tax distributions to Continuing Equity Owners, debt service, and capital expenditures. Historically, these cash requirements have been met through cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from capital-raising activities and borrowings under our loan facilities. We have historically had negative working capital driven by our high inventory turns and typical collection of payment from customers prior to payment of suppliers. As of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance, excluding restricted cash, of 152.7 million , and negative working capital, which we define as our current assets less cash minus our current liabilities, of 22.3) million . 
 
 In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the SVB Term Loan (as defined below) had an outstanding principal balance of 58.5 million , excluding unamortized debt issuance costs of 0.4 million , of which 52.0 million is classified as long-term. Refer to Note 7. "Debt" to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for aggregate future principal payments under the SVB Term Loan. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company declared and paid 1.8 million of tax distributions and TRA payments to, or on behalf of, members associated with their estimated income tax obligations. We are committed to continue to make quarterly distributions in connection with member estimated income tax obligations which we expect to fund with cash flow from operations.

Table of Contents 

 We believe, based on our current projections, that we have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet our projected operating, debt service, and tax distribution requirements for at least the next 12 months following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Additional future liquidity needs may include p ayments under the TRA, and state and federal taxes to the extent not offset by our deferred income tax assets, including those arising as a result of purchases or exchanges of common units for Class A and Class D common stock. Although the actual timing and amount of any payments that may be made under the TRA will vary, we expect that the payments that we will be required to make to the Continuing Equity Owners will be significant. Any payments made by us to the Continuing Equity Owners under the TRA will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us or to Brilliant Earth, LLC, and, to the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason, the unpaid amounts generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the TRA and therefore may accelerate payments due under the TRA. 
 
 To the extent that our current liquidity is insufficient to fund future activities, we may need to raise additional funds, such as attempts to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. Any additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations, and any future instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that could restrict our operations. We cannot ensure that we could obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all. 
 
 Cash Flow Analysis 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 3,504 15,514 Net cash used in investing activities (2,730) (10,729) Net cash used in financing activities (3,926) (12,299) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (3,152) (7,514) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 156,020 154,854 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period 152,868 147,340 
 
 Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 3.5 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 15.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 12.0 million . This decrease was primarily driven by 11.8 million from changes in assets and liabilities related to working capital management activ ities and a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash expense addbacks of 0.2 million. The decrease from changes in assets and liabilities related to operating activities was primarily due to an increase of 3.9 million in other assets and inventories, a decrease of 3.0 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 and other current liabilities, and a decrease of 0.9 million in operating lease liabilities. Also impacting the decrease from changes in assets and liabilities was a decrease of 2.5 million in deferred revenue and a decrease of 1.5 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets. 
 
 Net Cash Used In Investing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 2.7 million compared to 10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 8.0 million was principally due to a decrease in purchases of property and equipment related to new facilities leased during the period. 
 
 Net Cash Used In Financing Activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 3.9 million compared to 12.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease of 8.4 million was primarily due to lower tax distributions paid to members pursuant to the LLC Agreement of 8.1 million and lower payments made on the SVB Term Loan (as defined below) of 0.8 million. The decrease in tax distributions paid to members and payments made on the SVB Term Loan (as defined below) were partially offset by the payment of debt issuance costs of 0.1 million in connection with the First Amendment (as defined below) and repurchases of 0.4 million of our Class A common stock under the share repurchase program. 
 
 Silicon Valley Bank Credit Facilities 
 
 On May 24, 2022, Brilliant Earth, LLC, as borrower, and Silicon Valley Bank ("SVB"), as administrative agent and collateral agent for the lenders, entered into a credit agreement the "SVB Credit Agreement"), which provides for a secured term loan credit facility of 65.0 million (the "SVB Term Loan") and a secured revolving credit facility in the amount of up to 40.0 million (the "SVB Revolving Facility" and together with the SVB Term Loan, the "SVB Credit Facilities"). 
 
 On February 21, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the SVB Credit Agreement (the "First Amendment"), pursuant to which the lenders agreed to suspend the requirement to comply with the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant on the last day of the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024. The First Amendment also required us to maintain Balance Sheet Cash (defined as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held in accounts with the lenders and their affiliates) in an amount greater than the sum of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the SVB Revolving Facility (including issued letters of credit) and the aggregate principal amount of the SVB Term Loan outstanding at such time, which requirement applied at all times commencing on February 21, 2024 until the last day of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024. After such time, the minimum Balance Sheet Cash covenant no longer applied. See Note 7. "Debt" to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the SVB Credit Facilities. As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the SVB Revolving Facility and 58.5 million outstanding under the SVB Term Loan, 52.0 million of which is classified as long-term.

 Additional Liquidity Requirements 
 
 We are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of LLC Interests. We have no independent means of generating revenue. The LLC Agreement provides for the payment of certain distributions to the Continuing Equity Owners and to us in amounts sufficient to cover the income taxes imposed on such members with respect to the allocation of taxable income from Brilliant Earth, LLC as well as to cover our obligations under the TRA and other administrative expenses. 
 
 Regarding the ability of Brilliant Earth, LLC to make distributions to us, the terms of their financing arrangements, including the SVB Credit Facilities, contain covenants that may restrict Brilliant Earth, LLC from paying such distributions, subject to certain exceptions. Further, Brilliant Earth, LLC is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of Brilliant Earth, LLC (with certain exceptions), as applicable, exceed the fair value of its assets. 
 
 In addition, under the TRA, we are required to make cash payments to the Continuing Equity Owners equal to 85 of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize (or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize), as a result of (1) increases in our allocable share of the tax basis of Brilliant Earth, LLC's assets resulting from (a) our purchase of LLC Interests from each Continuing Equity Owner; (b) future redemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests for Class A common stock or cash; and (c) certain distributions (or deemed distributions) by Brilliant Earth, LLC; and (2) certain tax benefits arising from payments made under the TRA. We expect the amount of cash payments that we will be required to make under the TRA will be significant. The actual amount and timing of any payments under the TRA will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions or exchanges by the Continuing Equity Owners, the amount of gain recognized by the Continuing Equity Owners, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future, and the federal tax rates then applicable. Any payments made by us to the Continuing Equity Owners under the TRA will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. 
 
 Additionally, in the event we declare any cash dividends, we intend to cause Brilliant Earth, LLC to make distributions to us in amounts sufficient to fund such cash dividends declared by us to our shareholders. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings, or cash flow of Brilliant Earth, LLC for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions. 
 
 If we do not have sufficient funds to pay taxes or other liabilities or to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the TRA and therefore accelerate payments due under the TRA. In addition, if Brilliant Earth, LLC does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends will also be restricted or impaired.

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , there were no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments as disclosed in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our 2023 Form 10-K except for the update noted below. 
 
 In August and September 2024, the Company entered into three agreements with third parities to provide technology services. The total minimum contractual payments relating to these agreements with a term in excess of 12 months totaled approximately 2.9 million. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 There have been no changes to the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates from those described under "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

JOBS Act 
 
 We qualify as an "emerging growth company" pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act, enacted on April 5, 2012. Section 102 of the JOBS Act provides that, among other reporting exemptions, an "emerging growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2) (B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 
 The exemptions afforded to emerging growth companies will apply until we no longer meet the requirements of being an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (i) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO (December 31, 2026), (ii) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion or (iii) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (b) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness previously identified by management and described in Part II, Item 9A of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Previously Reported Material Weakness 
 
 As previously disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of our 2023 Form 10-K, we identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls ("ITGCs") in the areas of change management, user access and segregation of duties related to certain information technology ("IT") systems that support the Company's financial reporting processes, resulting in ineffective design and implementation of IT-dependent controls, such as journal entry controls. We believe that these control deficiencies were due to gaps in the sufficiency of IT resources and risk-assessment processes to identify and assess access in certain IT environments that could impact internal controls over financial reporting. 
 
 The material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, and there were no changes to previously issued financial results. However, because the material weakness creates a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, the Company's management concluded the Company's internal control over financial reporting was ineffective. 
 
 Remediation 
 
 In response to this material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective ITGCs for key IT systems, the Company has taken and is continuing to take actions to remediate change management and access related control failures. Our remediation plan includes: (i) enhancing processes around reviewing privileged access to key financial systems and ensuring appropriate segregation of duties, (ii) strengthening change management procedures, (iii) we have hired a director of ITGC position to expand the management and governance over ITGCs, (iv) developed and implemented additional company wide training addressing internal controls, (v) enhancing the existing access management procedures and ownership; and (vi) establishing and monitoring metrics within information technology to track adherence to access and change management controls. Our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time and will be continually reviewed to determine that it is achieving its objectives. 
 
 The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or that it will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than the actions to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described above, which was ongoing as of the date of issuance of this Form 10-Q, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are, from time to time, party to various claims and legal proceedings arising out of our ordinary course of business, but we do not believe that any of these claims or proceedings will have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 On December 5, 2022, plaintiff Veronica Cusimano, a former employee of the Company, filed a representative action against the Company pursuant to the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 in California Superior Court, Los Angeles County. The complaint alleges, on behalf of the plaintiff and similarly situated employees and former employees in California, various claims under the California Labor Code related to wages, overtime, meal and rest breaks, reimbursement of business expenses, wage statements and records, and other similar allegations. The plaintiff seeks civil penalties, attorneys' fees and costs in unspecified amounts, and other unspecified damages. On February 10, 2023, the Company filed a petition to compel arbitration on the basis of an agreement between the plaintiff and the Company to arbitrate any claims between them. On April 28, 2023, the petition was denied. The Company intends to vigorously defend the alleged individual and representative claims, and, on May 9, 2023, the Company appealed the Superior Court's denial of its petition to compel arbitration to the California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, and the appeal remains pending as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. At this time, any liability related to the alleged claims is not currently probable or reasonably estimable. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 The Company's risk factors are described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our 2023 Form 10-K. These factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K.

The terms of this Agreement, together with the Proprietary Information Agreement and that certain Indemnification and Advancement Agreement between the Company and Executive (the Indemnification Agreement ), are intended by the Company and Executive to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the employment of Executive by the Company and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, regarding Executive s service to the Company, including without limitation, the Offer Letter. The Company and Executive further intend that this Agreement, together with the Proprietary Information Agreement and the Indemnification Agreement, shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any judicial, administrative, or other legal proceeding to vary the terms of this Agreement, the Proprietary Information Agreement, or the Indemnification Agreement.

Exhibit 10.1 9 US-DOCS\141174324.2 (i) Dispute Resolution. To ensure the timely and economical resolution of disputes that arise in connection with this Agreement, Executive and the Company agree that, except as excluded herein, any and all controversies, claims and disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation any alleged violation of its terms or otherwise arising out of relationship of the Company and Executive, shall be resolved solely and exclusively by final and binding arbitration held in San Francisco County, California through JAMS in conformity with California law and the then-existing JAMS employment arbitration rules, which can be found at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq. shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration clause. All remedies available from a court of competent jurisdiction shall be available in the arbitration; provided, however, in the event of a breach of Sections 8(a) or 8(b), the Company may request relief from a court of competent jurisdiction if such relief is not available or not available in a timely fashion through arbitration as determined by the Company. The arbitrator shall: (a) provide adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute; and (b) issue a written arbitration decision, to include the arbitrator s essential findings and conclusions and a statement of the award. The arbitrator shall award the prevailing Party attorneys fees and expert fees, if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is acknowledged that it will be impossible to measure in money the damages that would be suffered if the Company or Executive fail to comply with any of the obligations imposed on them under Sections 8(a) and 8(b), and that in the event of any such failure, an aggrieved person will be irreparably damaged and will not have an adequate remedy at law. Any such person shall, therefore, be entitled to seek injunctive relief, including specific performance, to enforce such obligations, and if any action shall be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of Sections 8(a) and 8(b), none of the parties shall raise the defense, without a good faith basis for raising such defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law. Executive and the Company understand that by agreement to arbitrate any claim pursuant to this Section 8(i), they will not have the right to have any claim decided by a jury or a court, but shall instead have any claim decided through arbitration. Executive and the Company waive any constitutional or other right to bring claims covered by this Agreement other than in their individual capacities. Except as may be prohibited by applicable law, the foregoing waiver includes the ability to assert claims as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or collective action or representative proceeding. Nothing herein shall limit Executive s ability to pursue claims for workers compensation or unemployment benefits or pursue other claims which by law cannot be subject to mandatory arbitration. (j) Enforcement. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under present or future laws, such provision shall be fully severable; this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision had never comprised a portion of this Agreement; and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision there shall be added automatically as part of this Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid, and enforceable. (k) Withholding. The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement any federal, state, local, or foreign withholding or other taxes or charges which the Company is required to withhold. The Company shall be entitled to rely on an opinion of counsel if any questions as to the amount or requirement of withholding shall arise. 

Exhibit 10.1 10 US-DOCS\141174324.2 (l) Whistleblower Protections and Trade Secrets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Executive from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any United States governmental agency or entity in accordance with the provisions of and rules promulgated under Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or any other whistleblower protection provisions of state or federal law or regulation (including the right to receive an award for information provided to any such government agencies). Furthermore, in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 1833, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (i) Executive shall not be in breach of this Agreement, and shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law (x) for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official or to an attorney solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or (y) for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal; and (ii) if Executive files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, Executive may disclose the trade secret to Executive s attorney, and may use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade secret under seal, and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. 9. Golden Parachute Excise Tax. (a) Best Pay. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if any payment or benefit Executive would receive from the Company pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise Payment would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then such Payment will be equal to the Reduced Amount (as defined below). The Reduced Amount will be either (A) the largest portion of the Payment that would result in no portion of the Payment (after reduction) being subject to the Excise Tax or (B) the entire Payment, whichever amount after taking into account all applicable federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from a deduction of such state and local taxes), results in Executive s receipt, on an after- tax basis, of the greater economic benefit notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment may be subject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction in a Payment is required pursuant to the preceding sentence and the Reduced Amount is determined pursuant to clause (A) of the preceding sentence, the reduction shall occur in the manner (the Reduction Method that results in the greatest economic benefit for Executive. If more than one method of reduction will result in the same economic benefit, the items so reduced will be reduced pro rata (the Pro Rata Reduction Method ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Reduction Method or the Pro Rata Reduction Method would result in any portion of the Payment being subject to taxes pursuant to Section 409A (as defined below) that would not otherwise be subject to taxes pursuant to Section 409A, then the Reduction Method and/or the Pro Rata Reduction Method, as the case may be, shall be modified so as to avoid the imposition of taxes pursuant to Section 409A as follows: (1) as a first priority, the modification shall preserve to the greatest extent possible, the greatest economic benefit for Executive as determined on an after-tax basis; (2) as a second priority, Payments that are contingent on future events (e.g., being terminated without cause), shall be reduced (or eliminated) before Payments that are not contingent on future events; and (3) as a third priority, Payments that 

Exhibit 10.1 11 US-DOCS\141174324.2 are deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A shall be reduced (or eliminated) before Payments that are not deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A. (b) Accounting Firm. The accounting firm engaged by the Company for general tax purposes as of the day prior to the Change in Control will perform the calculations set forth in Section 9(a). If the firm so engaged by the Company is serving as the accountant or auditor for the acquiring company, the Company will appoint a nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder. The Company will bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such firm required to be made hereunder. The accounting firm engaged to make the determinations hereunder will provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to the Company within thirty (30) days before the consummation of a Change in Control (if requested at that time by the Company) or such other time as requested by the Company. If the accounting firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable with respect to a Payment, either before or after the application of the Reduced Amount, it will furnish the Company with documentation reasonably acceptable to the Company that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to such Payment. Any good faith determinations of the accounting firm made hereunder will be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. 10. Section 409A. (a) General. The intent of the Company and Executive is that the payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and the Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date, Section 409A and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Company determines that any compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement may be subject to Section 409A, the Company shall work in good faith with Executive to adopt such amendments to this Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Company determines are necessary or appropriate to avoid the imposition of taxes under Section 409A, including, without limitation, actions intended to (i) exempt the compensation and benefits payable under this Agreement from Section 409A, and/or (ii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A; however, this Section 10(a) shall not create an obligation on the part of the Company to adopt any such amendment, policy or procedure or take any such other action, nor shall the Company (A) have any liability for failing to do so, or (B) incur or indemnify Executive for any taxes, interest or other liabilities arising under or by operation of Section 409A. (b) Separation from Service, Installments and Reimbursements. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement: (i) no amount that constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A shall be payable pursuant to Section 6 unless the termination of Executive s employment constitutes a separation from service within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Department of Treasury Regulations Separation from Service (ii) for purposes of Section 409A, Executive s right to receive installment payments shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments; and (iii) to the extent that any reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A, such reimbursement or benefit shall be provided no later than December 31st of the year 

Exhibit 10.1 12 US-DOCS\141174324.2 following the year in which the expense was incurred. The amount of expenses reimbursed in one year shall not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement in any subsequent year. The amount of any in-kind benefits provided in one year shall not affect the amount of in-kind benefits provided in any other year. (c) Specified Employee. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Executive is deemed by the Company at the time of Executive s Separation from Service to be a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A, to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of the benefits to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A, such portion of Executive s benefits shall not be provided to Executive prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of Executive s Separation from Service with the Company or (ii) the date of Executive s death. Upon the first business day following the expiration of the applicable Section 409A period, all payments deferred pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid in a lump sum to Executive (or Executive s estate or beneficiaries), and any remaining payments due to Executive under this Agreement shall be paid as otherwise provided herein. (d) Release. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent that any payments due under this Agreement as a result of Executive s termination of employment are subject to Executive s execution and delivery of the Release, (i) if Executive fails to execute the Release on or prior to the Release Expiration Date (as defined below) or timely revokes Executive s acceptance of the Release thereafter, Executive shall not be entitled to any payments or benefits otherwise conditioned on the Release, and (ii) in any case where Executive s Date of Termination and the Release Expiration Date fall in two separate taxable years, any payments required to be made to Executive that are conditioned on the Release and are treated as nonqualified deferred compensation for purposes of Section 409A shall be made in the later taxable year. For purposes of this Section 10(d), Release Expiration Date shall mean the date that is twenty-one (21) days following the date upon which the Company timely delivers the Release to Executive, or, in the event that Executive s termination of employment is in connection with an exit incentive or other employment termination program (as such phrase is defined in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967), the date that is forty-five (45) days following such delivery date. To the extent that any payments of nonqualified deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) due under this Agreement as a result of Executive s termination of employment are delayed pursuant to this Section 10(d), such amounts shall be paid in a lump sum on the first payroll date following the date that Executive executes and does not revoke the Release (and the applicable revocation period has expired) or, in the case of any payments subject to Section 10(d)(ii), on the first payroll period to occur in the subsequent taxable year, if later. 11.
