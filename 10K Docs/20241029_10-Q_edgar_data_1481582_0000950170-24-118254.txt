We had cash restricted for the purpose of covering letters of credit that can be presented fo r potential insurance claims and product material purchases. 

If current cost had been used to value inventories, such inventories would have b een million and million higher than reported at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Approximately of inventories are accounted for under the LIFO method at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Non-LIFO inventories consist primarily of inventory at our foreign facilities, where we use the moving average cost and the specific cost methods to value inventory. Substantially all of our inventories consist of finished products. The Company has consignment inventory at certain customer locations, which totaled million an d million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 

 million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We recognized million of additional goodwill during the first nine months of 2024 related to purchase accounting adjustments for acquisitions completed in 2023. See Note 6: Acquisitions for further information. Pursuant to FASB ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, we review the recoverability of goodwill annually as of October 1 or whenever significant events or changes occur that might impair the recovery of recorded amounts. The most recently completed impairment test of goodwill was performed as of , and it was determined that impairment existed. Other intangible assets with finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives. We recorded an additional million of intangible assets during the first nine months of 2024 relating to the acquisition of Production Metals, LLC ("Production Metals"). See Note 6: Acquisitions for further information. We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.

million to acquire Production Metals. Based out of Monroe, Connecticut, Production Metals serves New England and the surrounding area with bar, tube, sheet, and plate products along with precision sawing, lasering, and water jet cutting in the aerospace, defense, and semiconductor end markets. Production Metals provides JT Ryerson with an opportunity to bolster our value-added aluminum, stainless, and specialty steel offerings in the Northeast United States and throughout the entire JT Ryerson network of service centers. This acquisition is not material to our consolidated financial statements. The company has not yet finalized the process of measuring the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations" as of September 30, 2024. 2023 Acquisitions On March 1, 2023, JT Ryerson acquired BLP Holdings, LLC ("BLP"). Based out of Houston, Texas, BLP is comprised of three divisions: Absolute Metal Products, Metal Cutting Specialists, and Houston Water Jet, serving various industries such as oil gas, aerospace, telecommunications, and structural fabrication. BLP provides complex fabrication services in addition to toll processing, including saw cutting, machining, and water jet cutting. On October 2, 2023, JT Ryerson acquired Norlen Incorporated ("Norlen"). Based out of Schofield, Wisconsin, Norlen is a full-service metal fabricator, providing stamping, machining, painting, and additional value-added fabrication services to industries including agriculture, HVAC, and defense. On November 1, 2023, JT Ryerson acquired TSA Processing ("TSA"). Headquartered in Houston, Texas, with locations across the Midwest and Southern United States, TSA is a stainless steel and aluminum coil and sheet processor. On December 1, 2023, JT Ryerson acquired Hudson Tool Steel Corporation ("Hudson"). Hudson is headquartered in Cerritos, California, with two facilities located in the Midwest and Northeast. Hudson is a supplier of tool steels and high-speed, carbon, and alloy steels. The 2023 acquisitions strengthen and expand JT Ryerson's valued-add services within our industry-leading stainless and aluminum franchises as well as our tool steel capabilities which allow us to increase our offerings to better serve our diverse customer base across our entire network. In 2023, we paid a total of million, net of cash acquired for the 2023 acquisitions. As of September 30, 2024 , there is million of unpaid purchase consideration related to the 2023 acquisitions accrued on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet relating to holdback payments expected to be paid within 18 months of the acquisition date and working capital true ups. We deemed the 2023 acquisitions individually immaterial, yet significant in the aggregate to the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Included in the financial results for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was million and million of revenue, respectively, and a net loss of million and net income of million, respectively, from the 2023 Acquisitions. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 there was million and million of revenue, respectively, and a net loss of million and net income of million, respectively, from the 2023 Acquisitions included in the financial results. The 2023 acquisitions are insignificant to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and the year-ended December 31, 2023. The financial results presented are for significance disclosure purposes only and are not indicative of future performance.

Net identifiable assets acquired 

The 2023 acquisitions discussed above were all accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the purchase price for each transaction has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values at the date of each acquisition. As needed, for each transaction the Company used a third-party valuation firm to estimate the fair values of property, plant, and equipment, leases, earn-outs, and intangible assets. Inventory was valued by the Company using acquisition date fair values of the metals. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect the allocations of each acquisition's purchase price as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The purchase price allocations for all 2023 acquisitions are complete. Included in the total purchase price is million of contingent consideration at fair value. The contingent consideration is based on the attainment of certain financial metrics over the course of 4 years following the acquisition date with a maximum payout of million. The fair value of the contingent consideration as of acquisition date was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. During the second quarter of 2024, the fair value of the contingent consideration was determined to be based on actual financial performance and updated projections through the end of the earnout period and as a result, million of income was recognized in other income and (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The fair value of the contingent consideration as of September 30, 2024 is . As part of the purchase price allocations for the 2023 acquisitions, we allocated million to trade names and million to customer relationships with weighted average lives of years and years, respectively. The goodwill arising from the 2023 acquisitions consists largely of expected strategic benefits, including enhanced operational scale, as well as expansion of acquired product and processing capabilities across our Company. 2023 Asset Acquisition During the first six months of 2023, JT Ryerson completed the purchase of certain assets from ExOne Operating, LLC. The total amount paid by JT Ryerson for the acquired assets was million. The transaction qualified for asset acquisition accounting and is not material to our consolidated financial statements. 2022 Acquisition Activity On August 31, 2022, JT Ryerson acquired Howard Precision Metals, Inc. ("Howard"). In the first three months of 2024, JT Ryerson paid million in holdback payments which are included within financing activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. On November 1, 2022, JT Ryerson acquired Excelsior, Inc. ("Excelsior"). In the first six months of 2024, JT Ryerson paid million in holdback payments which are included in financing activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

On June 10, 2024, Ryerson entered into a sixth amendment of its revolving credit facility to make conforming changes to effectuate the transition of the reference rate for revolving loans borrowed in Canadian Dollars from the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate to the forward-looking term rate based on the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average ("CORRA") (as amended, the Ryerson Credit Facility or Credit Facility ). At September 30, 2024 , Ryerson had million of outstanding borrowings, million of letters of credit issued, and million available under the Ryerson Credit Facility compared to million of outstanding borrowings, million of letters of credit issued, and million available at December 31, 2023 . Amounts outstanding under the Ryerson Credit Facility bear interest at (i) a rate determined by reference to (A) the base rate (the highest of the Federal Funds Rate plus , Bank of America s prime rate, and the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus or (B) a Term SOFR rate or (ii) for Ryerson Holding s Canadian subsidiary that is a borrower, (A) the prime rate or base rate (the highest of the Federal Funds Rate plus , Bank of America-Canada Branch s commercial loan rate, and the Term SOFR rate plus ), (B) a Term SOFR rate (for loans denominated in US Dollars), or (C) the CORRA rate (for loans denominated in Canadian Dollars). The spread over the base rate is between and and the spread over the SOFR rate is between and , depending on the amount available to be borrowed under the Ryerson Credit Facility; provided that such spreads shall be reduced by if the leverage ratio set forth in the most recently delivered compliance certificate is less than or equal to to 1.00. The spread over the CORRA rate is for a one-month interest period or for a three-month interest period. Ryerson also pays commitment fees on amounts not borrowed at a rate of . Overdue amounts and all amounts owed during the existence of a default bear interest at above the rate otherwise applicable thereto. T he weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility was at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. Borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility are secured by first-priority liens on all of the inventory, accounts receivables, lockbox accounts, and related assets of the borrowers and the guarantors. The Ryerson Credit Facility also contains covenants that, among other things, restrict Ryerson Holding and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to the incurrence of debt, the creation of liens, transactions with affiliates, mergers and consolidations, sales of assets, and acquisitions. The Ryerson Credit Facility also requires that, if availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility declines to a certain level, Ryerson maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter.

million recognized in the first quarter of 2024 and million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 for those terminations occurring during the respective periods. Additionally, the CSW Pension Plan is expecting lump sum payments for 2024 to be in excess of service cost and interest cost therefore, a settlement gain of million was recorded in the first nine months of 2024. The discount rate for measuring obligations increased from at December 31, 2023 to as of February 29, 2024. The expected long-term rate of return on pension assets has remained unchanged from December 31, 2023 at . In the first quarter of 2024, the Ryerson Canada Bargaining Unit Pension Plan made million of lump sum payments to plan participants and purchased million of annuities on behalf of plan participants. The lump sum payments and annuity purchases consisted of all of the existing liabilities of the Ryerson Canada Bargaining Unit Pension Plan, resulting in the termination of the plan. The Ryerson Canada Bargaining Unit Pension Plan was fully funded as of the termination date, and as such, all lump sum payments and annuity purchases were funded with pension plan assets. As a result, the Company recorded a million settlement loss in the first quarter of 2024. The net pension settlements and the curtailment gain were recorded within Other income and (expense), net within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company contributed million to the pension plan funds through the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and anticipates that it will have a minimum required pension contribution funding of approximately million for the remaining three months of 2024.

Fair Value Measurements The Company has various commodity derivatives to lock in hot roll coil, nickel, and aluminum prices for varying time periods. The fair value of hot roll coil, nickel, and aluminum derivatives is determined based on the spot price each individual contract was purchased at and compared with the one-month daily average actual spot price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (hot roll coil) and the London Metals Exchange (nickel and aluminum), respectively, for the commodity on the valuation date. In addition, the Company has numerous foreign exchange contracts to hedge variability in cash flows when a payment currency is different from our functional currency. The Company defines the fair value of foreign exchange contracts as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market value at the end of the period. The Company estimates the current market value of foreign exchange contracts by obtaining month-end market quotes of foreign exchange rates and forward rates for contracts with similar terms. The Company uses the exchange rates provided by Reuters. Each commodity and foreign exchange contract term varies in the number of months, but in general, contracts are between to in length. As the fair value of each commodity and foreign exchange contract is determined using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable (Level 2 inputs) and the market approach valuation technique, as described in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement", these derivative balances are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

million compared to income tax expense of million in the prior year. The income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily represents taxes at federal and local statutory rates where the Company operates, adjusted for certain one-time items. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of million compared to income tax expense of million in the prior year. The income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily represents taxes at federal and local statutory rates where the Company operates, adjusted for certain one-time items. The decrease in income tax in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 is primarily a result of the decrease in actual and forecasted earnings between the two periods. As required by ASC 740, the Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. The Company records a valuation allowance when, based upon the evaluation of all available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we analyze, among other things, our recent history of earnings, the nature and timing of reversing book-tax temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and future income. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on certain foreign and U.S. federal deferred tax assets until such time as in management s judgment, considering all available positive and negative evidence, the Company determines that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable. The valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly and will be maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of some or all of the valuation allowance . The valuation allowance was million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with ASC 740. We anticipate that certain statutes of limitation will close within the next twelve months resulting in the immaterial reduction of the reserve for uncertain tax benefits related to various intercompany transactions. The reserve for uncertain tax benefits increased from million as of December 31, 2023 to million as of September 30, 2024 due to accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions.

 Industry and Operating Trends 
 We are a metals service center providing value-added processing and distribution of industrial metals with operations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and China. We purchase large quantities of metal products from primary producers and sell these materials in smaller quantities to a wide variety of metals-consuming industries. We carry a full line of nearly 75,000 products in stainless steel, aluminum, carbon steel, and alloy steels and a limited line of nickel and red metals in various shapes and forms. In addition to our metals products, we offer numerous value-added processing and fabrication services, and nearly 80 of the metals products we sell are processed by us by bending, beveling, blanking, blasting, burning, cutting-to-length, drilling, embossing, flattening, forming, grinding, laser cutting, machining, notching, painting, perforating, polishing, punching, rolling, sawing, scribing, shearing, slitting, stamping, tapping, threading, welding, or other techniques to process materials to a specified thickness, length, width, shape, and surface quality pursuant to specific customer orders. 
 Similar to other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon customer forecasts, historic buying practices, supply agreements with customers, mill lead times, and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. We may enter into swaps in order to mitigate our customers risk of volatility in the price of metals, as well as metal hedges to mitigate our own risk of volatility in the price of metals. We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and earnings as we sell existing metals inventory. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we may pass on to our customers. Changes in average selling prices are primarily driven by commodity metals prices, which impact Ryerson s selling prices over the subsequent three to six-month period. 
 The metals service center industry is cyclical, volatile in demand and pricing, and difficult to predict. In the third quarter of 2024, Ryerson experienced lower average selling prices of 3.7 and a decrease in shipments of 4.5 , compared to the second quarter of 2024, as the period was characterized by slower sequential demand in a declining pricing environment. In the first nine months of 2024, Ryerson experienced lower average selling prices of 10.0 and a decrease in shipments of 0.2 compared to the first nine months of 2023, due to the effects of contracting industrial manufacturing demand, which influenced both lower pricing as well as lower volume. 
 20 

Key steel industry economic indicators continued to report a contraction in industrial activity during the third quarter of 2024. This is evidenced by the Institute for Supply Management s Purchasing Managers Index PMI ), which reported readings below the growth threshold of 50, with a reading of 47.2 in September and readings of 47.2 and 46.8 in August and July, respectively. Excluding March 2024, with a reading of 50.3, eleven out of the past twelve months have recorded a contractionary, or below 50, PMI reading. U.S. Industrial Production, which measures industrial sector business output, reported contractionary year-over-year output for most of the third quarter, with a July reading of a 0.7 decline followed by zero year-over-year growth in August. 
 According to the Metal Service Center Institute ("MSCI"), North American service center volumes decreased by 3.2 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. Ryerson's North American volumes decreased 1.4 over the same period. Compared to the first nine months of 2023, Ryerson's overall consolidated end market demand, as measured by sales volumes, has decreased by 0.2 for the first nine months of 2024, with decreased volumes in Consumer Durables, Commercial Ground Transportation, Industrial Machinery Equipment, and Oil Gas sectors. Decreases in these end-markets were partially offset by increased volumes in HVAC, Food Processing Agricultural Equipment, Construction Equipment, and the Metal Fabrication Machine Shops sectors. On a quarterly sequential basis, the industry volume as reported by the MSCI, decreased 5.1 compared to a decrease in Ryerson's North American volume of 5.5 . On a quarterly sequential basis, Ryerson's overall consolidated volumes decreased by 4.5 , with decreased volumes in Food Processing Agricultural Equipment, Consumer Durables, Commercial Ground Transportation, Industrial Machinery Equipment and the Oil Gas sectors. Decreases in these end-markets were partially offset by increased volumes in the HVAC sector. 
 21 

First Nine Months 2024 vs. First Nine Months 2023 Performance 
 During the first nine months of 2024, Ryerson has accomplished key milestones of our record three-year investment cycle, including start-up of operations at our state-of-the-art 900,000 square foot University Park, Illinois, service center, ongoing assimilation of our ERP conversion in our southern service centers, launch of our redesigned e-commerce platform at www.Ryerson.com , and nearing the final stages of equipment installation for our Shelbyville, Kentucky, processing center, as well as the acquisition of Production Metals, LLC, which introduces valuable Aerospace Defense exposure to Ryerson s end-market mix. While our investment cycle initiatives have occurred against the backdrop of volatile pricing and contracting demand, we believe that our initiatives will translate into an improved operating model that can provide better customer experiences.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP measure is included in the subsequent table. 
 To provide greater insight into the Company s operating trends apart from the period s one-time transactions, Ryerson provides adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share figures, which are not U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP financial measures, to compliment the reported GAAP net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share figures. Management uses these metrics to assess year-over-year performance excluding non-recurring transactions. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share do not represent, and should not be used as a substitute for, net income (loss) or diluted earnings (loss) per share determined in accordance with GAAP. As illustrated in the below table, the net loss attributable to Ryerson Holding Corporation of 4.3 million includes a restructuring charge of 2.8 million, as well as a pension settlement loss of 2.2 million, a 1.3 gain on an insurance settlement, and a 0.3 million curtailment gain related to various retirement benefit plans. After adjusting for these non-core business transactions and the related income taxes, the adjusted net loss attributable to Ryerson Holding Corporation for the first nine months of 2024 is 1.7 million, a decrease of 121.6 million compared to net income attributable to Ryerson Holding Corporation of 119.9 million in the first nine months of 2023 which had no adjustments.

Recent Developments 
 On August 26, 2024, Canada announced notice of intent to impose 25 surtaxes on Chinese steel and aluminum imports under Section 53 of the Custom Tariff Law. Additionally, a 100 surtax will be assessed on all Chinese-made electric vehicles effective October 1, 2024. The move is intended to protect Canada s workers and domestic investment in steel and aluminum related production and processing. We believe the impact of these regulatory measures can be supportive of North American supply and may be beneficial to Ryerson s average selling prices for our Canadian service centers. 
 22 

On July 11, 2024, the US government announced that it will impose a melt and pour requirement for imports of steel products from Mexico and will impose tariffs of 25 for steel products that are melted and poured in a country other than Mexico, Canada, or the US. The move is expected to help close a loophole in section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act ("Section 232") that has allowed steel produced outside of North America to avoid the tariffs by shipping via Mexico for further processing before being exported to the US. Additionally, the US will impose a smelt and cast requirement for aluminum imports from Mexico. Specifically, any product from Mexico whose primary country of smelt, secondary country of smelt, or country of most recent cast is China, Russia, Belarus, or Iran will be subject to 10 232 duties upon entering the US. We believe the impact of these regulatory measures are supportive of US domestic supply and may be beneficial to Ryerson s volumes and average selling prices. 
 On May 14, 2024, the U.S. government announced trade actions that increased tariffs across strategic sectors such as steel and aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, critical minerals, solar cells, ship-to-shore cranes, and medical products. The tariff rate on certain steel and aluminum products under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 ("Section 301") will increase from between zero to 7.5 to 25 in 2024. We anticipate that these actions will provide limited support for metal commodity prices, given China steel and aluminum imports represent a small portion of overall U.S. imports at 2.2 and 3.6 , respectively, in 2023. 
 On April 12, 2024, the U.S. and United Kingdom governments prohibited metal-trading exchanges from accepting new aluminum, copper, and nickel produced by Russia and barred the import of the metals into the U.S. and Britain. We anticipate these actions will provide support for metal commodity prices, but ultimately the impact on the Company's operations is unclear. 
 On February 24, 2023, the US government announced trade actions targeting goods and entities from Russia, which included a proclamation to impose 200 ad valorem tariffs on Russian-origin aluminum products and derivative products and other articles made from Russian primary aluminum or Russian aluminum castings. The duties will be imposed under Section 232 and cited by the White House due to (1) challenges faced by US aluminum producers in the face of high levels of aluminum imports and high energy prices; (2) recent increases in imports of aluminum from Russia, whose market is especially export-oriented, by 53 percent between March and July 2022; and (3) the fact that the Russian aluminum industry is a key part of Russia's defense industrial base. Ryerson has communicated to all vendors that we will not accept any Russian originating metal. The trade actions announced by the US government should support prices for Ryerson's product sales mix as the underlying domestic and North American supply-demand balance is protected from oversupply.

Components of Results of Operations 
 We generate substantially all of our revenue from sales of our metals products. The majority of revenue is recognized upon delivery of product to customers. The timing of shipment is substantially the same as the timing of delivery to customers given the proximity of our distribution sites to our customers. Revenues associated with products which we believe have no alternative use, and where the Company has an enforceable right to payment, are recognized on an over-time basis. Over-time revenues are recorded in proportion with the progress made toward completing the performance obligation. 
 Sales, cost of materials sold, gross profit, and operating expense control are the principal factors that impact our profitability. 
 Net sales . Our sales volume and pricing are driven by market demand, which is largely determined by overall industrial production and conditions in the specific industries in which our customers operate. Sales prices are also primarily driven by market factors such as overall demand and availability of product. Our net sales include revenue from product sales, net of returns, allowances, customer discounts, and incentives. 
 Cost of materials sold . Cost of materials sold includes metal purchase and in-bound freight costs, third-party processing costs, and direct and indirect internal processing costs. The cost of materials sold fluctuates with our sales volume and our ability to purchase metals at competitive prices. Increases in sales volume generally enable us to improve purchasing leverage with suppliers, as we buy larger quantities of metals inventories. 
 Gross profit . Gross profit is the difference between net sales and the cost of materials sold. Our sales prices to our customers are subject to market competition. Achieving acceptable levels of gross profit is dependent on our acquiring metals at competitive prices, our ability to manage the impact of changing prices, and efficiently managing our internal and external processing costs. 
 Operating expenses . Optimizing business processes and asset utilization to lower fixed expenses such as employee, facility, and truck fleet costs, which cannot be rapidly reduced in times of declining volume, and maintaining a low fixed cost structure in times of increasing sales volume, have a significant impact on our profitability. Operating expenses include costs related to warehousing and distributing our products as well as selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Revenue for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 decreased from the same periods a year ago due to lower average selling prices caused by lower commodity prices in 2024 due to the effects of contracting industrial manufacturing demand. Compared to the year ago periods, average selling prices decreased for nearly all of our product lines in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 with the largest decreases in our stainless flat, stainless long, stainless plate, and carbon plate products. Tons sold decreased slightly in the nine-month period while increasing slightly in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the year ago periods. The product lines with the largest decreases in tons sold in 2024 are our carbon long, aluminum long, and aluminum plate product lines partially offset by an increase in carbon flat and stainless steel flat tons sold in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the largest increases in tons sold were in our carbon flat and stainless steel flat products partially offset by decreases in tons sold in our carbon long, aluminum long, and aluminum plate product lines compared to the third quarter of 2023.

The decrease in cost of materials sold in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ago periods is primarily due to a decrease in average cost of materials sold per ton caused by lower commodity prices in 2024. Compared to the year ago periods the average cost of materials sold decreased across all product lines with the largest decreases in our stainless flat, stainless long, stainless plate, and carbon plate product lines. During the third quarter of 2024, LIFO income was 18.1 million compared to LIFO income of 33.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, LIFO income was 27.1 million compared to LIFO income of 38.4 million in the first nine months of 2023.

Warehousing, delivery, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 3.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 while expenses increased 22.9 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ago period. Expenses in the third quarter of 2024 included 8.5 million of expenses from companies acquired during 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023, while the first nine months of 2024 included expenses of 23.9 million from companies acquired in 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, expenses decreased 4.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and expenses decreased 1.0 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ago period. On a same-store basis, expenses in the three-month and nine-month periods changed in the following categories from the prior year periods:	 
 lower incentive compensation expense of 4.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 10.4 million in the first nine months of 2024; 

lower benefit expense of 2.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 7.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to lower medical expense; 

lower overtime and temporary help expense of 1.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 5.8 million in the first nine months of 2024; 

lower operating expenses of 0.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 4.6 million in the first nine months of 2024; and 

lower delivery expense of 1.3 million in the third quarter and 2.7 million in the first nine months of 2024; partially offset by: 

higher reorganization costs of 5.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 30.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to start up costs associated with our new state of the art University Park location as well as system conversion activity; and 

higher selling, general, and administrative expenses of 0.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 resulting from higher credit loss accruals and higher consulting fees. 

The three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 include restructuring charges of 1.1 million and 2.8 million, respectively, related to severance costs for headcount reductions as we work on optimizing our operating model and improving productivity. The three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 also included a 1.3 million gain on an insurance settlement.

Interest and other expense on debt increased in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ago periods primarily due to a higher level of borrowings outstanding under our 1.3 billion revolving credit facility the Ryerson Credit Facility and higher interest rates on the Ryerson Credit Facility borrowings in the first nine months of 2024. 
 The other expense in the first nine months of 2024 includes a 2.2 million settlement loss resulting from the termination of the Ryerson Canada Bargaining Unit Pension Plan. Partially offsetting the 2.2 million settlement loss was a 1.6 million settlement gain and a 0.3 million curtailment gain related to lump-sum buyouts and a reduction in future years of service for the Central Steel Wire ("CSW") pension and other post-employment benefit plans resulting from workforce reductions at CSW related to the move of the CSW headquarters and main operations to a new facility in University Park, IL. Other income and (expense), net in the first nine months of 2024 also includes foreign currency translation gains of 1.0 million. Other income and (expense), net in the first nine months of 2023 is primarily related to foreign currency translation gains. 
 Provision for income taxes . Our effective income tax rate was 6.3 in the third quarter of 2024 and 19.2 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 26.8 in the third quarter of 2023 and 24.8 in the first nine months of 2023. The differences between our effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 were mainly due to state and foreign income taxes adversely offset by the effects of certain discrete items recorded during the periods which have a disproportionate effect on the overall tax rate due to the low level of pretax loss in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Earnings (loss) per share . Basic loss per share was 0.20 in the third quarter of 2024 and 0.13 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to basic earnings per share of 1.02 in the third quarter of 2023 and 3.40 in the first nine months of 2023. Diluted loss per share was 0.20 in the third quarter of 2024 and 0.13 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to diluted earnings per share of 1.00 in the third quarter of 2023 and 3.34 in the first nine months of 2023. The changes in earnings per share are due to the results of operations discussed above as well as having fewer shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2024 and the first nine months of 2024 after the repurchase of 2,746,081 shares of common stock since October 1, 2023.

Liquidity and Cash Flows 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowing availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility. Our principal source of operating cash is from the sale of metals and other materials. Our principal uses of cash are for payments associated with the procurement and processing of metals and other materials inventories, costs incurred for the warehousing and delivery of inventories, the selling and administrative costs of the business, and capital expenditures. 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of 35.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 54.3 million at December 31, 2023. Our total debt outstanding at September 30, 2024 increased to 522.1 million compared to 436.5 million at December 31, 2023. We had a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 38 and 32 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We had total liquidity (defined as cash and cash equivalents and availability under the Ryerson Credit Facility and foreign debt facilities) of 491 million at September 30, 2024 versus 656 million at December 31, 2023. Our net debt (defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents) was 487 million and 382 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total liquidity and net debt are not U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP financial measures. We believe that total liquidity provides additional information for measuring our ability to fund our operations. Total liquidity does not represent, and should not be used as a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and total liquidity is not necessarily an indication of whether cash flow will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements. We believe that net debt provides a clearer perspective of the Company s overall debt profile. Net debt should not be used as a substitute for total debt outstanding as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Of the total cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, 10.6 million was held in subsidiaries outside the U.S. which is deemed to be permanently reinvested. Ryerson does not currently foresee a need to repatriate earnings from its non-U.S. subsidiaries. Although Ryerson has historically satisfied needs for more capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances, Ryerson could elect to repatriate earnings held in foreign jurisdictions, which could result in higher effective tax rates. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability for the effect of a possible repatriation of these earnings as management intends to permanently reinvest these earnings outside of the U.S. Specific plans for reinvestment include funding for future international acquisitions and funding of existing international operations.

Operating activities. Working capital fluctuates throughout the year based on business needs. Working capital needs tend to be counter-cyclical, meaning that in periods of expansion the Company will use cash to fund working capital requirements, but in periods of contraction the Company will generate cash from reduced working capital requirements. In the first nine months of 2024, working capital requirements decreased mainly due to a decrease in inventory, as market prices for metals decreased in the first nine months of 2024 along with lower tons in inventory to better align inventory levels with expected sales volumes. Partially offsetting the decrease in inventory was an increase in accounts receivable from higher sales levels during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and a decrease in accounts payable driven by reduced inventory purchases as discussed above. In the first nine months of 2023, working capital requirements decreased primarily due to decreased inventory costs as market prices for metals decreased in the first nine months of 2023. Material purchases were higher at the end of the third quarter of 2023 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 resulting in an increase in accounts payable in the third quarter of 2023. The remaining cash flows generated in the first nine months of 2023 were due to net income generation. 
 Investing activities. The Company's main investing activities are capital expenditures and acquisitions. Capital expenditures have decreased year-over-year as the Company is nearing completion of its investment in a new facility in University Park, Illinois, a project which began in 2022. In the first nine months of 2024, the Company paid 44.1 million to acquire Production Metals, LLC. In the first nine months of 2023, the Company paid 39.9 million to acquire BLP Holdings, LLC and 9.7 million to purchase certain assets from ExOne Operating, LLC. See Note 6: Acquisitions within Part I, Item I of this report, for further discussion of the 2024 and 2023 acquisitions. 
 Financing activities. The Company's main source of liquidity to fund working capital requirements is borrowings on the Ryerson Credit Facility. In the first nine months of 2024, we increased credit facility borrowings to fund our acquisitions and capital expenditures. In the first nine months of 2023, cash generated from operating activities was sufficient to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, as well as share repurchases and dividends. Book overdrafts fluctuate based on the timing of payments. Cash dividends paid in the first nine months of 2024 were 18.8 million compared to 18.5 million paid to shareholders in the first nine months of 2023. We repurchased 51.0 million of common stock during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 107.6 million of common stock repurchased in the first nine months of 2023. Share repurchases were higher in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2024 due to our participation in repurchasing shares from Platinum's secondary offerings in 2023 (see Note 11: Stockholders Equity within Part I, Item 1 for additional details). In the first nine months of 2024, the Company paid 1.9 million and 3.4 million in holdback payments for the 2022 acquisitions of Howard Precision Metals, Inc. and Excelsior, Inc., respectively. 
 30 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of business with customers, vendors, and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled 2 million and 12 million, respectively as of September 30, 2024. We do not have any other material off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. 
 Capital Resources 
 We believe that cash flow from operations and proceeds from the Ryerson Credit Facility will provide sufficient funds to meet our contractual obligations and operating requirements in the normal course of business. 
 Total debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet increased to 522.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 436.5 million at December 31, 2023, mainly due to cash utilized for capital expenditures and the Production Metals acquisition. 
 Total debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 consisted of the following amounts: 524.0 million of borrowings under the Ryerson Credit Facility, 1.8 million of foreign debt, less 3.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. For further information, see Note 7: Long Term Debt in Part I, Item I - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Pension Funding 
 At December 31, 2023, pension liabilities exceeded plan assets by 63.9 million. Through the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have made 8.8 million in pension contributions and we anticipate an additional minimum required pension contribution of approximately 2.1 million in the remaining three months of 2024 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA and Pension Protection Act in the U.S. and Ontario Pension Benefits Act in Canada. Future contribution requirements depend on the investment returns on plan assets, the impact of discount rates on pension liabilities, and changes in regulatory requirements. We are unable to determine the amount or timing of any such contributions required by ERISA or whether any such contributions would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or cash flows. 
 Due to the closure of the CSW headquarters in Chicago, IL and move to University Park, IL, a significant reduction in the service years of employees occurred between the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024, triggering curtailment accounting. The CSW Pension and Postretirement Benefits plans were remeasured as of February 29, 2024, resulting in a curtailment gain. As the curtailment was a net gain, the gain is required to be reflected in the periods in which the terminations occur, resulting in a curtailment gain of 0.3 million recognized in the first quarter of 2024 and 0.5 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 for those terminations occurring during the respective periods. Additionally, the CSW Pension Plan is expecting lump sum payments for 2024 to be in excess of service cost and interest cost and therefore, a settlement gain of 1.6 million was recorded in the first nine months of 2024. The discount rate for measuring obligations of the CSW pension plan increased from 5.24 at December 31, 2023 to 5.57 as of February 29, 2024. The expected long-term rate of return on pension assets has remained unchanged from December 31, 2023 at 3.85 . 
 In the first quarter of 2024, the Ryerson Canada Bargaining Unit Pension Plan made 1.2 million of lump sum payments to plan participants and purchased 5.0 million of annuities on behalf of plan participants. The lump sum payments and annuity purchases consisted of all of the existing liabilities of the Ryerson Canada Bargaining Unit Pension Plan, resulting in the termination of the plan. The Ryerson Canada Bargaining Unit Pension Plan was fully funded as of the termination date, and as such, all lump sum payments and annuity purchases were funded with pension plan assets. As a result, the Company recorded a 2.2 million settlement loss in February of 2024. 
 The net settlement loss and the curtailment gain were recorded within Other income and (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in returns on plan assets may affect our plan funding, cash flows, and financial condition. Differences between actual plan asset returns and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impact the measurement of the following year s pension expense and pension funding requirements. However, we believe that cash flow from operations and the Ryerson Credit Facility described above will provide sufficient funds to make the minimum required contributions. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 The Company expects to make approximately 526 million in principal payments to satisfy its debt obligations, consisting of 2 million of foreign debt coming due within a year, and 524 million for the Ryerson Credit Facility coming due in 2027. Please refer to Part I, Item I - Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7: Long-term Debt for further information. 
 The Company expects to pay approximately 34 million of interest on the Ryerson Credit Facility and foreign debt over the next 12 months and 60 million thereafter. Interest payments related to the variable rate debt were estimated using the weighted average interest rate for the respective debt instrument. 
 31 

The Company leases various assets including real estate, trucks, trailers, mobile equipment, processing equipment, and IT equipment. We have noncancelable operating leases expiring at various times through 2043 and finance leases expiring at various times through 2031. The total amount of future lease payments is estimated to be 482 million, with 49 million due over the next 12 months. We did not have any material leases signed but not yet commenced as of September 30, 2024. 
 Purchase obligations with suppliers are entered into when we receive firm sales commitments with certain of our customers. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding purchase obligations of approximately 20 million expiring within a year. 
 Income Taxes 
 We maintain a valuation allowance on certain foreign and U.S. federal deferred tax assets until such time as in management s judgment, considering all available positive and negative evidence, and consistent with its past determinations, we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our primary areas of market risk include changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. We continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them. 
 Interest rate risk 
 Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates. We are exposed to market risk related to our variable-rate long-term debt. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have no publicly traded debt. The carrying value of our debt was 522.1 million and 436.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The carrying value approximates our fair value due to the short-term nature of the underlying borrowings on the Ryerson Credit Facility. 
 From time to time, we may use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. As of September 30, 2024, we have no outstanding interest rate swaps. 
 As of September 30, 2024 all of our debt is at variable interest rates. A hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates on variable debt would have increased interest expense for the first nine months of 2024 by approximately 4.4 million. 
 Foreign exchange rate risk 
 We are subject to foreign currency risks primarily through our operations in Canada, Mexico, and China and we use foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to currency price fluctuations. Foreign currency contracts are principally used to purchase U.S. dollars. We had foreign currency contracts with a U.S. dollar notional amount of 2.3 million outstanding at September 30, 2024 and a fair value of zero. We do not currently account for these contracts as hedges but rather mark these contracts to market with a corresponding offset to current earnings. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized no gain or loss associated with its foreign currency contracts. A hypothetical strengthening or weakening of 10 in the foreign exchange rates underlying the foreign currency contracts from the market rate as of September 30, 2024 would increase or decrease the fair value of the foreign currency contracts by 0.2 million or 0.3 million, respectively. 
 The currency effects of translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will not be recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income until there is a liquidation or sale of those foreign subsidiaries. 
 Commodity price risk 
 In general, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices, customer contracts, and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. 
 Metal prices can fluctuate significantly due to several factors including changes in foreign and domestic production capacity, raw material availability, metals consumption, and foreign currency rates. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage a limited portion of our exposure to fluctuations in the cost of certain commodities. No derivatives are held for trading purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 65,942 tons of hot roll coil swap contracts with a net asset value of 1.8 million, 6,860 tons of aluminum swap contracts with a net asset value of 0.5 million, and 1,588 tons of nickel swap contracts with a net asset value of 9.0 million. We do not currently account for these swaps as hedges, but rather mark these contracts to market with a corresponding offset to current earnings. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a gain of 5.1 million associated with its commodity derivatives. 
 32 

A hypothetical strengthening or weakening of 10 in the commodity prices underlying the commodity derivative contracts from the market rate as of September 30, 2024 would increase or decrease the fair value of commodity derivative contracts by 1.3 million. 
 Item 4. Control s and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 As required by SEC Rule 15d-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.
