CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Some of the statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements because they relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about T. Rowe Price OHA Select Private Credit Fund (the Company, we, us or our ), our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Forward-looking statements may include, among other things, statements as to our future operating results, our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies, the impact of the investments that we expect to make, the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives, our expected financings and investments, the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital, and the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies. Words such as expect, anticipate, target, goals, project, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, continue, forecast, may, will, would, should, potential, variations of such words, and similar expressions indicate a forward-looking statement, although not all forward-looking statements include these words. Readers are cautioned that the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions, are not guarantees of future performance, and are subject to risks, events, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Our actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the items discussed in Item 1A entitled Risk Factors in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Item 1A entitled Risk Factors in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 or in other reports we may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC from time to time. Other factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially include, but are not limited to, changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, risks associated with possible disruption due to terrorism in our operations or the economy generally, the impact of geo-political conditions, including revolution, insurgency, terrorism or war, and future changes in laws or regulations and conditions in our operating areas. 
 Any forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts, information and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless we are required to do so by law. Investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to investors or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.

 The Company has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which the Company will reinvest all cash distributions declared by the Board on behalf of our shareholders who do not elect to receive their distributions in cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash distribution or other distribution, then our shareholders who have not opted out of our distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional 
 57 

from the date of payment. The purpose of this arrangement avoids distributions being characterized as a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Shareholders should understand that any such distribution is not based solely on the Company s investment performance, and can only be sustained if the Company achieves positive investment performance in future periods and/or the Adviser continues to provide expense support. Shareholders should also understand that the Company s future repayments of expense support will reduce the distributions that they would otherwise receive. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the performance necessary to sustain these distributions, or be able to pay distributions at all. 
 
 Sources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a U.S. GAAP basis, include required adjustments to U.S. GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions.

 (1) The per share data was derived by using the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. 
 (2) The amount shown for a share outstanding does not correspond with the aggregate realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments for the period due to the timing of capital share transactions of fund shares in relation to fluctuating market values of investments of the Company. 
 (3) Net increase in net assets resulting from operations per share in these financial highlights may be different from the net increase (decrease) in net assets per share on the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to changes in the number of weighted average shares outstanding and the effects of rounding. 
 (4) Total return based on net asset value is calculated as the change in net asset value per share during the period, assuming distributions that have been declared are reinvested on the effects of the performance of the Company during the period. Total return has not been annualized.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with "Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events, our future performance or financial condition and involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in any forward-looking statements. Dollar amounts are in thousands, except per share data, percentages and as otherwise noted. 

Overview 
 The Company was initially formed on December 16, 2021 as a Delaware limited liability company and subsequently converted into a Delaware statutory trust on March 2, 2022. We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act on June 30, 2023. The Adviser is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, beginning with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. We have an indefinite term. 
 The Company's investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, predominately in the form of current income, with select investments capturing long-term capital appreciation, while maintaining a strong focus on downside protection. The Company invests primarily in directly originated and customized private financing solutions, including loans and other debt securities with a strong focus on senior secured lending to larger companies. The Company primarily targets investments in first lien loans, unitranche loans, second lien loans and other corporate secured debt. The Company may also invest in equity interests such as common stock, preferred stock, warrants or options, which generally would be obtained as part of providing a broader financing solution. Under normal circumstances, the Company will invest directly or indirectly at least 80 of its total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in private credit. We were formed to make investments and generate returns in the form of current income and long-term capital appreciation. From inception through September 30, 2024, we have invested approximately 2.2 billion in aggregate cost of debt investments prior to any subsequent exits or repayments, including the 521.4 million of debt investments acquired through an in-kind contribution on June 30, 2023. 
 While most of our investments will be in U.S. companies, from time to time, we also expect to invest in European and other non-U.S. companies. Our portfolio may also include equity interests such as common stock, preferred stock, warrants or options, which generally would be obtained as part of providing a broader financing solution. Under normal circumstances, we will invest directly or indirectly at least 80 of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in private credit. 
 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on senior secured loans and securities of private U.S. companies. The level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to private companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies. Our senior and subordinated debt investments are expected to bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. As of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023, 99.7 and 100 of our debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio were at floating rates, respectively. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with transactions. Original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest 
 62 

income. Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts.

 Our Adviser has developed a risk rating methodology for a systematic approach to portfolio monitoring. The Adviser assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments and rates each of them based on the following categories, which we refer to as Risk Ratings. The Adviser reviews the ratings on a quarterly basis and adjusts any scores as appropriate to align with the below definitions. 
 70 

Risk Ratings Definitions 
 Risk Rating 1 - Investments with a score of 1 contain the lowest amount of risk in our portfolio. Borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. 
 Risk Rating 2 - Investments with a score of 2 contain an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. Borrower is performing in-line with expectations, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. Investments are assigned a score of 2 at the time of origination or acquisition. 
 Risk Rating 3 - Investments with a score of 3 mean the borrower is performing below expectations and that the loan s risk has increased somewhat since origination or acquisition. 
 Risk Rating 4 - Investments with a score of 4 mean the borrower is performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased materially since origination or acquisition. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 120 days past due). 
 Risk Rating 5 - Investments with a score of 5 mean the borrower is performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. 

The below table summarizes the Risk Ratings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 We entered into an Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. For additional information see Note 3. Fees, Expenses, Agreements and Related Party Transactions to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for distributions paid), and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we incurred no U.S. federal excise tax.

 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments (1,272) 7,251 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency translation 27 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency forward contracts 30 132 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) (1,215) 7,383 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments (6,532) 7,960 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency translation 27 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency forward contracts 1,072 141 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) (5,433) 8,101 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated (1.2) million and (5.4) million of net unrealized losses, respectively, which were primarily due to unrealized losses on investments of (1.3) million and (6.5) million, respectively, driven by reversal of unrealized gains recorded in prior periods and negative valuation adjustments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated 7.4 million and 8.1 million of net unrealized gains, respectively, which were primarily due to positive valuation adjustments on investments driven by tightening spreads. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from proceeds of our continuous offering of common shares, proceeds from net borrowings on our credit facilities, cash flows from interest, dividends and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments. The primary uses of our cash are investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser and Administrator or its affiliates), and cash distributions to the holders of our shares. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 37.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used approximately 660.4 million in cash for operating activities, primarily due to investment purchases of 1,072.6 million, partially offset by sales and principal repayments of 287.6 million, an increase in the payable for investments purchased of 63.4 million, and a net increase in assets resulting from operations of 77.2 million. Cash provided by financing activities was approximately 592.0 million during the year, which was primarily the result of 382.9 million from the issuance of common shares and 776.5 million of debt borrowings, partially offset by repayments of debt of 485.0 million and distributions paid in cash of 81.8 million. 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had 147.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 118.8 million in cash for operating activities, primarily due to investment purchases of 346.1 million, partially offset by sales and principal repayments of 18.7 million and an increase in the payable for investments purchased of 194.9 million. Cash provided by financing activities was 246.7 million during the 
 76 

period, which was primarily the result of 179.5 million from the issuance of common shares and 80.1 million of debt borrowings. 
 Borrowings 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate amount of 850.5 million of debt outstanding and our asset coverage ratio was 226.9 . As of December 31, 2023, we had an aggregate amount of 558.6 million of debt outstanding and our asset coverage ratio was 226.1 .

 Distributions 
 We expect to pay regular monthly distributions. Any distributions we make will be at the discretion of our Board, who will consider, among other things, our earnings, cash flow, capital needs and general financial condition, as well as our desire to comply with the RIC requirements, which generally require us to make aggregate annual distributions to our shareholders of at least 90 of our net investment income. As a result, our distribution rates and payment frequency may vary from time to time and there is no assurance we will pay distributions in any particular amount, if at all. 
 
 The per share amount of distributions on Class S, Class D and Class I shares will generally differ because of different class-specific shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees that are deducted from the gross distributions for each share class.

 We intend to operate in a manner so as to continuously qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2023. To qualify for and maintain RIC tax treatment, among other things, we must distribute to our shareholders in respect of each taxable year of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of the sum of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of our net long-term capital losses. In order to avoid the imposition of certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute to our shareholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of: (1) 98 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for such calendar year; (2) 98.2 of our capital gains in excess of capital losses, adjusted for certain ordinary 
 81 

losses, generally for the one-year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year; and (3) the sum of any net ordinary income plus capital gains net income for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no federal income tax. 
 The U.S. federal income tax characterization of distributions declared and paid for the fiscal year will be determined at fiscal year-end based upon our investment company taxable income for the full fiscal year and distributions paid during the full year. 
 
 Sources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a U.S. GAAP basis, include required adjustments to U.S. GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions.

 (1) There were no Class D shares issued or outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 We have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, which is an opt-out distribution reinvestment plan. 
 Under this plan, shareholders (other than those located in specific states, who are clients of selected participating brokers, as outlined below, or who have elected to opt out of the plan) will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the same class of our common shares to which the distribution relates. If a shareholder elects to opt out, that shareholder will receive cash distributions. The purchase price for shares purchased under our distribution reinvestment plan will be equal to the then current NAV per share of the relevant class of common shares. Shareholders will not pay transaction related charges when purchasing shares under our distribution reinvestment plan, but all outstanding Class S and Class D shares, including those purchased under our distribution reinvestment plan, will be subject to ongoing servicing fees. The U.S. federal income tax characterization of distributions declared and paid for the fiscal year will be determined at fiscal year-end based upon our investment company taxable income for the full fiscal year and distributions paid during the full year. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 Subject to the discretion of the Board, we have commenced a share repurchase program pursuant to which we intend to conduct quarterly repurchase offers to allow our shareholders to tender their shares at a price equal to the NAV per share for the applicable class of shares on each date of repurchase. Our Board may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time if it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. 
 Under our share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we intend to limit the number of shares to be repurchased to no more than 5 of our outstanding common shares as of the last day of the immediately preceding quarter. In the event the number of shares tendered exceeds the repurchase offer amount, shares will be repurchased on a pro rata basis. All unsatisfied repurchase requests must be resubmitted in the next quarterly tender offer, or upon the recommencement of the share repurchase program, as applicable. We may choose to offer to repurchase fewer shares than described above, or none at all. 
 We expect to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers each quarter using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV. The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived, at our discretion, in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early 
 82 

Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders. We intend to conduct the repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 There were no shares repurchased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. 
 Investments at Fair Value 
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period. 
 84 

The Company is required to report its investments for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. The Company values its investments in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainties of valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a ready market for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. 
 Investments that are listed or traded on an exchange and are freely transferable are valued at either the closing price (in the case of securities and futures) or the mean of the closing bid and offer (in the case of options) on the principal exchange on which the investment is listed or traded. Investments for which other market quotations are readily available will typically be valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, the Company will utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Where it is possible to obtain reliable, independent market quotations from a third-party vendor, the Company will use these quotations to determine the value of its investments. The Company utilizes mid-market pricing (i.e., mid-point of average bid and ask prices) to value these investments. The Adviser obtains these market quotations from independent pricing services, if available; otherwise from one or more broker quotes. To assess the continuing appropriateness of pricing sources and methodologies, the Adviser regularly performs price verification procedures and issues challenges as necessary to independent pricing services or brokers, and any differences are reviewed in accordance with the valuation procedures. The Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. 
 Where prices or inputs are not available or, in the judgment of the Adviser, not reliable, valuation approaches based on the facts and circumstances of the particular investment will be utilized. Securities that are not publicly traded or for which market prices are not readily available, as will be the case for a substantial portion of the Company s investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser as the Company s valuation designee under Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, pursuant to the Company s valuation policy, and under the oversight of the Board, based on, among other things, the input of independent valuation firms retained by the Company to review the Company s investments. These valuation approaches involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments complexity. 
 With respect to the quarterly valuation of investments, the Company undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments for which reliable market quotations are not readily available as of the last calendar day of each quarter, which includes, among other procedures, the following: 
 The valuation process begins with each investment being preliminarily valued by the Adviser s valuation team in consultation with the Adviser s investment professionals responsible for each portfolio investment; 
 In addition, independent valuation firms retained by the Company prepare quarter-end valuations of each such investment that was (i) originated or purchased prior to the first calendar day of the quarter and (ii) is not a de minimis investment, as determined by the Adviser. The independent valuation firms provide a final range of values on such investments to the Adviser. The independent valuation firms also provide analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations; 
 The Adviser s valuation committee with respect to the Company (the Valuation Committee reviews each valuation recommendation to confirm they have been calculated in accordance with the Company s valuation policy and compares such valuations to the independent valuation firms valuation ranges to ensure the Adviser s valuations are reasonable; 
 The Adviser s Valuation Committee then determines fair value marks for each of the Company s portfolio investments; and 
 The Board and Audit Committee periodically review the valuation process and provide oversight in accordance with the requirements of Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. 
 As part of the valuation process, the Company will take into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments for which reliable market quotations are not readily available, many of which are loans, including and in combination, as relevant, of: (i) the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company, generally based on an analysis of 
 85 

discounted cash flows, publicly traded comparable companies and comparable transactions, (ii) the nature and realizable value of any collateral, (iii) the portfolio company s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, (iv) the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and (v) overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity or debt sale occurs, the Adviser will consider whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. 
 The Company has and will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of the Company s portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter, and the Company and the Adviser may reasonably rely on that assistance. However, the Adviser is responsible for the ultimate valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Company s valuation policy, the Board s oversight and a consistently applied valuation process. 
 The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. 
 The fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodology used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The levels used for classifying investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
 Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology that reflect unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 
 Level 2: Inputs to the valuation methodology other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. 
 Level 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Adviser s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. 
 The Company s accounting policy on the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to the Company s financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations, on the financial statements. The SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. This establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. We are in compliance with Rule 2a-5's valuation requirements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and interest rate risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and therefore, we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser as the Company s valuation designee under Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, based on, among other things, the input of independent third-party valuation firm(s) retained by the Company, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 86 

Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We may fund portions of our investments with borrowings on a short-term basis, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure shareholders that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 99.7 of our debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio were at floating rates. Based on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering base rate floors and ceilings for floating rate instruments assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure) (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 As of September 30, 2024 
 Change in Interest Rates Interest Income Interest Expense Net Income Up 300 basis points 62,363 (16,609) 45,754 Up 200 basis points 41,576 (11,073) 30,503 Up 100 basis points 20,788 (5,536) 15,251 Down 100 basis points (20,788) 5,536 (15,251) Down 200 basis points (41,576) 11,073 (30,503) 
 We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (1) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. 
 (2) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 On the date of each Advance, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III , each Lender shall, in accordance with instructions received by the Borrower, either (i) make available to the Borrower, in same day funds, an amount equal to such Lender s Pro Rata Share of such Advance, by payment into the account which the Borrower has designated in writing or (ii) remit in same day funds an amount equal to such Lender s Pro Rata Share of such Advance into the Unfunded Exposure Account provided that, with respect to an Advance funded pursuant to Section 2.02(f) , each Lender shall remit the Advance equal to such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Unfunded Exposure Amount Shortfall in same day funds to the Unfunded Exposure Account. 
 (b) Each Benchmark Advance shall bear interest at the applicable Benchmark Yield Rate. The Base Rate Advances Outstanding shall bear interest at the Base Rate Yield Rate. So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may request that the Administrative Agent convert (i) any Base Rate Advance, in whole and not in part, to a Benchmark Advance in Dollars and (ii) any Benchmark Advance, in whole and not in part, to a Base Rate Advance in Dollars, in each case, by delivering a Conversion Notice to the Administrative Agent no later than 1 00 p.m. at least three Business Days before the Conversion Date on which (w) such Base Rate Advance is to be converted into a Benchmark Advance or (x) such Benchmark Advance is to be converted into a Base Rate Advance, as applicable.

 -67- 

Exposure Amount, the Borrower shall request an Advance in the amount of such shortfall (the Unfunded Exposure Amount Shortfall ). Following receipt of a Notice of Borrowing (which shall specify the account details of the Unfunded Exposure Account where the funds will be made available), each Lender shall fund its Pro Rata Share of such Unfunded Exposure Amount Shortfall in accordance with Section 2.02(b) , notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (including, without limitation, (a) the Borrower s failure to satisfy any of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.02 , (b) the existence of an Event of Default (other than the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event with respect to the Borrower) or (c) the existence of (x) an Unmatured Event of Default or (y) a Borrowing Base Deficiency) provided that the Borrower shall have, prior to the applicable Advance Date, deposited an amount not less than the Unfunded Exposure Equity Amount in the Unfunded Exposure Account pursuant to Section 2.04(a)(x) or by an equity contribution by the Transferor or by any combination of those two methods provided further that to the extent that funding such Unfunded Exposure Amount Shortfall would cause a Lender to make an Advance that would result in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Pro Rata Share of Advances to exceed such Lender s Pro Rata Share of its Commitment, such Lender may in its sole discretion fund such excess. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall not be required to fund the Unfunded Exposure Account unless and until the existence of an Event of Default or the last day of the Reinvestment Period or as required to prevent the occurrence of a Borrowing Base Deficiency. For the further avoidance of doubt, any obligation of a Lender to make an Advance pursuant to this Section 2.02(f) shall be without prejudice to the obligation of the Borrower to cure any Borrowing Base Deficiency that exists prior to such Advance or results therefrom. 
 (f) The obligation of each Lender to remit its Pro Rata Share of any Advance shall be several from that of each other Lender and the failure of any Lender to so make such amount available to the Borrower shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder.

If such disagreement cannot be resolved within two Business Days, the determination of the Administrative Agent as to such amounts shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto absent demonstrable error.

This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

Any notice relating to any repayment pursuant to this Section 2.18(a) shall be revocable by the Borrower only to the extent such repayment notice was conditioned upon the effectiveness of some other event not subject to the control of the Borrower, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by written notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition to repayment is not or will not be satisfied.

 (d) The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Make-Whole Premium constitutes additional consideration for the Lenders to enter into this Agreement provided that no Make-Whole Premium shall be payable in connection with any termination (in whole or in part) of the Maximum Facility Amount (i) if any Lender makes any claim for increased costs or other amounts pursuant to Section 2.10 or Section 2.11 , (ii) during a Benchmark Unavailability Period, (iii) if CIBC or an Affiliate thereof is no longer the Administrative Agent or (iv) within 30 days following the occurrence of a Non-Approval Event.

 -90- 

Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Advances of that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

For the avoidance of doubt, no Breakage Fees shall be payable to any Lender under this Section 2.21(b) .

 (b) No Lender shall be required to make any assignment or delegation pursuant to Section 2.22(a) if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
 Section II.23 Increased Commitments . So long as no Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and then be continuing, the Borrower shall have the right from time to time to request an increase in the Commitments upon not less than ten (10) days (or such shorter period as is acceptable to Administrative Agent) prior written notice to Administrative Agent provided that (i) no Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Commitment, (ii) each such requested increase in the Commitments shall be in a minimum principal amount of 10,000,000 or any larger integral multiple of 1,000,000, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall have consented to such increase and (iv) contemporaneously with requesting each such increase, the Borrower shall certify to Administrative Agent in writing that immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such increase, (A) Borrower is in compliance in all material respects with all of the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and (B) no Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and then be continuing and provided further that (i) any increase in the Commitments which is accomplished by increasing the Commitment of any Lender or Lenders who are at the time of such increase party to this Agreement (which Lender or Lenders shall consent to such increase in their sole and absolute discretion) shall be accomplished as follows (A) this Agreement will be amended by Borrower, Administrative Agent and those Lender(s) whose Commitment(s) is or are being increased (but without any requirement that the consent of any other Lenders be obtained) to reflect the revised Commitments of each of Lenders pursuant to amendment

 Section II.24 Inability to Determine Rates Benchmark Replacement Setting Illegality . 
 (a) Inability to Determine SOFR . Subject to paragraphs (b) through and (f) below, if, prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for any Benchmark for any Available Currency 
 (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that the applicable Benchmark for an Available Currency cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof, or 
 (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that applicable Benchmark for such Available Currency for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their Advances for such Interest Period, then the Administrative Agent shall give written notice thereof (or telephonic notice, promptly confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter, whereupon any obligation of the Lenders to make Advances at the Benchmark for such Available Currency, and any right of the Borrower to continue make Advances at the Benchmark for such Available Currency or to convert Base Rate Advances to make Advances at the Benchmark for such Available Currency, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Advances or affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Advances at the Benchmark for such Available Currency (to the extent of the affected Advances or affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to a Base Rate Advance in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding 
 -93- 

affected Advances at the Benchmark for such Available Currency will be deemed to have been converted into a Base Rate Advance at the end of the applicable Interest Period. Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.10 . Subject to paragraphs (b) through (f) below, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Benchmark for such Available Currency cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any given day, the interest rate on Base Rate Advances shall be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate until the Administrative Agent revokes such determination. 
 (b) Benchmark Replacement . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Transaction Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to any setting of the then-current Benchmark for an Available Currency, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (a) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for such Available Currency for all purposes hereunder and under any Transaction Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Transaction Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (b) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement for such Available Currency will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Transaction Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5 00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Transaction Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. 
 (c) Conforming Changes . In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement for such Available Currency, the Administrative Agent will (with the consent of the Borrower) have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Transaction Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. 
 (d) Notices Standards for Decisions and Determinations . The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders of (i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement for any Available Currency and (ii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement. The Administrative Agent will notify the Borrower of (x) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.24(e) and (y) the commencement of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.24 , including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.24 . 
 -94- 

(e) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Transaction Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark for any Available Currency is a term rate and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark for such Available Currency (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative for a Benchmark for such Available Currency (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower, may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. 
 (f) Benchmark Unavailability Period . Upon the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a Benchmark for such Available Currency, all Advances denominated in the applicable Available Currency shall bear interest at the Base Rate. During a Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Base Rate. 
 (g) Illegality . If any event referenced in Section 2.10(b) shall occur and shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender to perform any of its obligations hereunder, to make, maintain or fund any Advance or to determine or charge interest rates based upon any Benchmark and such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower and the other Lenders, whereupon until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Lender to make Advances in the affected Available Currency, or to continue or convert outstanding Advances as or into Advances in the affected Available Currency, shall be suspended. In the case of the making of a Advance in an affected Available Currency, such Lender s Advance shall be made as a Base Rate Advance as part of the same Advance for the same Interest Period and, if the affected Advance is then outstanding, such Advance shall be converted to a Base Rate Advance either (i) on the last day of the then-current Interest Period applicable to such Advance if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Advance to such date or (ii) immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain such Advance to such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the affected Lender shall, prior to giving such notice to the Administrative Agent, use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office if such designation would avoid the need for giving such notice and if such designation would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in the good faith exercise of its discretion. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.10 . 
 Section II.25 Capital Contributions . Any member of the Borrower may, but shall not be obligated to, make a capital contribution in cash or Loan Assets to the Borrower at any time and for any purpose. All cash contributed to the Borrower shall be treated as Principal Collections, except to the extent that the Servicer specifies to the Collateral Agent and the Securities Intermediary that such cash 
 -95- 

shall constitute Interest Collections and shall be deposited into the Collection Account in accordance with Section 2.19 as designated by the Servicer. 
 Section II.26 Mitigation Obligations . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.10 , or requires the Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any governmental authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.11 , then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Advances hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.10 or 2.11 , as applicable, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
