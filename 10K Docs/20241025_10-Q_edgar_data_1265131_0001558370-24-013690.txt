As shown in the table above, loans accounted for on a non-accrual basis increased from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 by million. The change in non-accrual loans was primarily due to increases in commercial and industrial loans of million, partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans of million, commercial real estate owner occupied loans of million and 1-4 family residential loans of million. The increase in commercial and industrial loans in non-accrual status since December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the addition of loans with an aggregate loan balance of million, partially offset by principal payoffs. Of the million increase in commercial and industrial loans in non-accrual status, million was due to the addition of credit relationships from the auto note financing industry subsector. The decrease in commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans in non-accrual status since December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the reclassification of a single non-accrual loan from loans held for investment during the first quarter of 2024. This loan was subsequently sold in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease in commercial real estate owner occupied loans in non-accrual status was primarily due to the payoff of a single relationship with a loan balance of million since December 31, 2023. The decrease in 1-4 family residential loans in non-accrual status since December 31, 2023 was primarily due to principal payoffs. For non-accrual loans that are considered to be collateral-dependent, the Company has implemented the practical expedient to measure the allowance using the fair value of the collateral. For non-accrual loans that are not collateral dependent, the Company measures the allowance based on discounted expected cash flows. Loan Modifications Loan modifications are typically structured to create affordable payments for the debtor and can be achieved in a variety of ways. The Bank modifies loans by reducing interest rates and/or lengthening loan amortization schedules.

 of the available for sale debt securities held were past due at September 30, 2024. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had not made a decision to sell any of its debt securities held, nor did the Company consider it more likely than not that it would be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. The Company does not expect to have credit losses associated with the debt securities, and allowance was recognized on the debt securities portfolio. Loans Held for Investment The allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment represents management s best estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of the Company s existing portfolio. Management s methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses uses the current expected credit losses CECL standard. Management considers the level of allowance for credit losses to be a reasonable and supportable estimate of expected credit losses inherent within the loans held for investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024. While the Company believes it has an appropriate allowance for the existing loan portfolio at September 30, 2024, additional provision for losses on existing loans may be necessary in the future. Future changes in the allowance for credit losses are expected to be volatile given dependence upon, among other things, the portfolio composition and quality, as well as changes in macroeconomic forecasts and loan cash flow assumptions. In addition to the allowance for credit losses, the Company maintains a separate allowance for credit losses related to off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments, and this amount is included in other liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. For further information on the policies that govern the estimation of the allowances for credit losses levels, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Company s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. To determine the Company s best estimate of expected credit losses as of September 30, 2024, the Company utilized a single macroeconomic alternative scenario, or S5, published by Moody s Analytics in September 2024 that was updated to reflect the U.S. economic outlook. During our previous macroeconomic assessment as of December 31, 2023, we utilized a single macroeconomic alternative scenario, or S7, published by Moody s Analytics in December 2023. The S5 alternative economic scenario expects the economy to underperform in the long-term. In this alternative scenario, elevated borrowing costs reduce credit-sensitive spending, upcoming fiscal disputes in Congress weaken business and consumer sentiment, and concerns grow about broader international conflicts. Significant variables that impact the modeled losses across the Company s loan portfolios are the U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, growth rates and unemployment rate assumptions. Changes in these assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect the estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date or between reporting periods. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the slight reversal of credit losses reflected improvements to the U.S. economic outlook and decreases in specific reserves of million within our broker dealer segment, offset by increases in specific reserves and net portfolio changes within the banking segment. The increase in the provision for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflected a significant build in the allowance related to loan portfolio changes since December 31, 2022 and a deteriorating outlook for commercial real estate markets. Specific to the Bank, the net impact to the allowance of changes associated with collectively evaluated loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a reversal of credit losses of million, compared to a provision for credit losses of million, respectively, on collectively evaluated loans, while the net impact to the allowance of changes associated with individually evaluated loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a provision for credit losses of million and million, respectively. The changes in the allowance for credit losses during the noted periods were primarily attributable to the Bank and also reflected other factors including, but not limited to, loan mix, and changes in loan balances and qualitative factors from the prior quarter. The changes in the allowance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were also impacted by net recoveries of million and net charge-offs of million, respectively.

The allowance is based on the estimated exposure at default, multiplied by the lifetime Probability of Default grade and Loss Given Default grade for that particular loan segment. The Bank estimates expected losses by calculating a commitment usage factor based on industry usage factors. The commitment usage factor is applied over the relevant contractual period. Loss factors from the underlying loans to which commitments are related are applied to the results of the usage calculation to estimate any liability for credit losses related for each loan type. The expected losses on unfunded commitments align with statistically calculated parameters used to calculate the allowance for credit losses on the funded portion. There is no reserve calculated for letters of credit as they are issued primarily as credit enhancements and the likelihood of funding is low. Other noninterest expense ) ) Balance, end of period The increases in the reserve for unfunded commitments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to increases in expected loss rates. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decreases in the reserve for unfunded commitments were primarily due to decreases in commitment balances.

Certain of these fair value hedges have been designated as a portfolio layer, which provides the Company the ability to execute a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk associated with a portfolio of similar prepayable assets whereby the last dollar amount estimated to remain in the portfolio of assets is identified as the hedged item. Additionally, the Company has outstanding interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges and utilized to manage the variability of cash flows associated with its variable rate borrowings. Under each of its interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges, the Company receives a floating rate and pays a fixed rate on the outstanding notional amount. The Company assesses the hedge effectiveness both at the onset of the hedge and at regular intervals throughout the life of the derivative. To the extent that the derivative instruments are highly effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows or fair value, changes in the fair value of the derivatives designated as hedges of cash flows are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income

The cumulative basis adjustment included in the carrying value of the hedged items totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Bank and PrimeLending held aggregate cash collateral advances of million and million to offset net asset derivative positions on its commitments to sell MBSs and derivative instruments designated as hedges at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. PrimeLending had advanced cash collateral totaling million and million to offset net liability positions on its commitments to sell MBSs at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Derivatives on Behalf of Customers The Bank offers derivative contracts to certain customers in connection with their risk management needs. These derivatives include back-to-back interest rate swaps. The Bank manages the risk associated with these contracts by entering into an equal and offsetting derivative with a third-party dealer bank. These derivatives generally work together as an economic interest rate hedge, but the Bank does not designate them for hedge accounting treatment. Consequently, changes in fair value of the corresponding derivative financial asset or liability were recorded as either a charge or credit to current earnings during the period in which the changes in fair value occurred, typically resulting in no net earnings impact.

Securities sold under repurchase agreements are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transactions. The Company may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities, which is monitored on a daily basis. Securities Lending Activities The Company s securities lending activities include lending securities for other broker-dealers, lending institutions and its own clearing and retail operations. These activities involve lending securities to other broker-dealers to cover short sales, to complete transactions in which there has been a failure to deliver securities by the required settlement date and as a conduit for financing activities. When lending securities, the Company receives cash or similar collateral and generally pays interest (based on the amount of cash deposited) to the other party to the transaction. Securities lending transactions are executed pursuant to written agreements with counterparties that generally require securities loaned to be marked-to-market on a daily basis. The Company receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount generally in excess of the fair value of securities loaned. The Company monitors the fair value of securities loaned on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained or refunded, as necessary. Collateral adjustments are made on a daily basis through the facilities of various clearinghouses. The Company is a principal in these securities lending transactions and is liable for losses in the event of a failure of any other party to honor its contractual obligation. Management sets credit limits with each counterparty and reviews these limits regularly to monitor the risk level with each counterparty. The Company is subject to credit risk through its securities lending activities if securities prices decline rapidly because the value of the Company s collateral could fall below the amount of the indebtedness it secures. In rapidly appreciating markets, credit risk increases due to short positions. The Company s securities lending business subjects the Company to credit risk if a counterparty fails to perform or if collateral securing its obligations is insufficient. In securities transactions, the Company is subject to credit risk during the period between the execution of a trade and the settlement by the customer.

 Consolidated income before income taxes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included the following contributions from our reportable business segments. The banking segment contributed 48.1 million and 131.3 million of income before income taxes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024; The broker-dealer segment contributed 17.0 million and 43.1 million of income before income taxes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024; and The mortgage origination segment incurred 8.7 million and 23.8 million of losses before income taxes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we declared and paid total common dividends of 33.2 million. On October 24, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.17 per common share, payable on November 22, 2024 to all common stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 8, 2024. In January 2024, our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program through January 2025, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to 75.0 million of our outstanding common stock, inclusive of repurchases to offset dilution related to grants of stock-based compensation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 19.9 million to repurchase an aggregate of 640,042 shares of our common stock at an average price of 31.04 per share pursuant to the stock repurchase program. Reconciliation and Management s Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We present certain measures in our selected financial data that are not measures of financial performance recognized by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). Tangible book value per common share is defined as our total stockholders equity reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by total common shares outstanding. Tangible common equity to tangible assets is defined as our total stockholders equity reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by total assets reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets. These measures are important to investors interested in changes from period to period in tangible common equity per share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. For companies such as ours that have engaged in business combinations, purchase accounting can result in the recording of significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets related to those transactions. You should not view this disclosure as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and our disclosure is not necessarily comparable to that of other companies that use non-GAAP measures. The following table reconciles these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, book value per common share and equity to total assets (dollars in thousands, except per share data).

 Recent Developments Economic Environment The extent of the impacts of uncertain economic conditions on our financial performance that began in 2022, and have continued into 2024, will depend in part on developments outside of our control including, among others, the timing and significance of further changes in U.S. Treasury yields and mortgage interest rates, changes in funding costs, inflationary pressures, and international armed conflicts and their impact on supply chains. As discussed in more detail within Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K, events in early 2023 relating to the failures of certain banking entities caused general uncertainty and concern regarding the liquidity adequacy of the banking sector as a whole. In light of these events, we have continued our efforts to monitor deposit flows and balance sheet trends to ensure that our liquidity needs and financial flexibility are maintained. During 2023, we increased interest-bearing deposit rates to address rising market interest rates and intense competition for liquidity to combat deposit outflows. Throughout 2023 and into the third quarter of 2024, we experienced net interest margin compression reflecting deposit repricing activity and demand deposit migration into interest-bearing accounts. Deposit costs remained elevated through the third quarter of 2024; however, the interest paid on our deposits increased at a slower pace during the second and third quarters of 2024 as we reduced higher cost brokered deposits and our interest-bearing deposits yield flattened and market expectations for a decrease in the Federal Reserve funds emerged. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, we continued to access core deposits from our Hilltop Securities Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured sweep program, while the Bank was not utilizing any of its Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB borrowing capacity. Market conditions and external factors may unpredictably impact the competitive landscape for deposits such as those experienced during the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, throughout 2023 and into the third quarter of 2024, the market interest rate environment increased competition for liquidity and the premium at which liquidity was available to meet funding needs. While funding costs will continue to be influenced by various factors, including competitive pressures and broader economic conditions, with the recent 50-basis point decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate in September 2024 and the possibility of additional rate cuts in 2024, we anticipate that our cost of deposits will begin to trend modestly downward. An unexpected influx of withdrawals of deposits could adversely impact our ability to rely on organic deposits to primarily fund our operations, potentially requiring greater reliance on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawals of deposits or to fund continuing operations. These sources may include proceeds from FHLB advances, sales of investment securities and loans, federal fund lines of credit with correspondent banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered time deposits, borrowings from the Federal Reserve and borrowings under lines of credit with other financial institutions. Refer to the discussions in the Segment Results Banking Segment and Liquidity and Capital Resources Banking Segment sections that follow for more details regarding the Bank s deposits, available liquidity and borrowing capacity at September 30, 2024. We expect uncertainties discussed above, the impact of interest rate movements on the shape and inversions of the yield curve and challenge for deposits that persisted through 2023 and during the first three quarters of 2024, to continue during the remainder of 2024. Asset Valuation As discussed in more detail within Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K, at each reporting date between annual impairment tests, we consider potential indicators of impairment including the condition of the economy and financial services industry; government intervention and regulatory updates; the impact of recent events to financial performance and cost factors of the reporting unit; performance of our stock and other relevant events. Given the potential impacts as a result of the operating performance of our reporting segments and overall economic conditions, actual results may differ materially from our current estimates as the scope of such impacts evolves or if the duration of business disruptions is longer than currently anticipated. We continue to monitor developments regarding overall economic conditions, market capitalization, and any other triggering events or circumstances that may indicate an impairment in the future. Specifically, the mortgage origination segment experienced operating losses during 2023, which have continued at a lesser extent into the first nine months of 2024 due to conditions and challenges discussed in detail within the discussion of segment results that follow. 

 51 

Table of Contents 
 To the extent future operating performance of our reporting segments remain challenged and below forecasted projections during 2024, significant assumptions such as expected future cash flows or the risk-adjusted discount rate used to estimate fair value are adversely impacted, or upon the occurrence of what management would deem to be a triggering event that could, under certain circumstances, cause us to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangible assets, an impairment charge may be recorded for that period. In the event that we conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, a non-cash charge for the respective amount of such impairment would be recorded to earnings. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital or regulatory capital. Outlook Our balance sheet, operating results and certain metrics during 2023 and the first nine months of 2024 reflected economic conditions that remain uncertain, and will depend in part on several developments outside of our control including, among others, the timing and significance of further changes in U.S. Treasury yields and mortgage interest rates, and a volatile economic forecast. As noted within our 2023 Form 10-K, these conditions, coupled with exposure to changes in funding costs, inflationary pressures, and international armed conflicts and their impact on supply chains within our business segments during 2023 have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our operating results during 2024. Factors Affecting Results of Operations As a financial institution providing products and services through our banking, broker-dealer and mortgage origination segments, we are directly affected by general economic and market conditions, many of which are beyond our control and unpredictable. A key factor impacting our results of operations is changes in the level of interest rates in addition to twists in the shape of the yield curve with the magnitude and direction of the impact varying across the different lines of business. Other factors impacting our results of operations include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in volume and price levels of securities, inflation, political events, investor confidence, investor participation levels, legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements and competition. All of these factors have the potential to impact our financial position, operating results and liquidity. In addition, the recent economic and political environment has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives, both enacted and proposed, that could substantially change the regulation of the financial services industry and may significantly impact us. Segment Information The Company has two primary business units, PCC (banking and mortgage origination) and Securities Holdings (broker-dealer). Under GAAP, the Company s units are comprised of three reportable business segments organized primarily by the core products offered to the segments respective customers: banking, broker-dealer and mortgage origination. Consistent with our historical segment operating results, we anticipate that future revenues will be driven primarily from the banking segment, with the remainder being generated by our broker-dealer and mortgage origination segments. Operating results for the mortgage origination segment have historically been more volatile than operating results for the banking and broker-dealer segments. The banking segment includes the operations of the Bank. The banking segment primarily provides business and consumer banking services from offices located throughout Texas and generates revenue from its portfolio of earning assets. The Bank s results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income. The Bank also derives revenue from other sources, including service charges on customer deposit accounts and trust fees. The broker-dealer segment includes the operations of Securities Holdings, which operates through its wholly owned subsidiaries Hilltop Securities, Momentum Independent Network and Hilltop Securities Asset Management, LLC. The broker-dealer segment generates a majority of its revenues from fees and commissions earned from investment advisory and securities brokerage services. Hilltop Securities is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA and a member of the New York Stock Exchange NYSE ). Momentum Independent Network is an introducing broker-dealer that is also registered with the SEC and FINRA. Hilltop Securities, Momentum Independent Network and Hilltop Securities Asset Management, LLC are registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

 The mortgage origination segment includes the operations of PrimeLending, which offers a variety of loan products and generates revenue predominantly from fees charged on the origination and servicing of loans and from selling these loans in the secondary market. Corporate includes certain activities not allocated to specific business segments. These activities include holding company financing and investing activities, merchant banking investment opportunities, and management and administrative services to support the overall operations of the Company. The eliminations of intercompany transactions are included in All Other and Eliminations. Additional information concerning our reportable business segments is presented in Note 21, Segment and Related Information , in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

NM Not meaningful Key Performance Indicators We utilize several key indicators of financial condition and operating performance to evaluate the various aspects of our business. In addition to traditional financial metrics, such as revenue and growth trends, we monitor several other financial measures and non-financial operating metrics to help us evaluate growth trends, measure the adequacy of our capital based on regulatory reporting requirements, measure the effectiveness of our operations and assess operational efficiencies. These indicators change from time to time as the opportunities and challenges in our businesses change.

 Performance ratios and asset quality ratios are typically used for measuring the performance of banking and financial institutions. We consider return on average stockholders equity, return on average assets and net interest margin to be important supplemental measures of operating performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other parties interested in the banking and financial industry. The net recoveries (charge-offs) to average loans outstanding ratio is also considered a key measure for our banking segment as it indicates the performance of our loan portfolio. In addition, we consider regulatory capital ratios to be key measures that are used by us, as well as banking regulators, investors and analysts, to assess our regulatory capital position and to compare our regulatory capital to that of other financial services companies. We monitor our capital strength in terms of both leverage ratio and risk-based capital ratios based on capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. The risk-based capital ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations, but banking organizations are widely expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. How We Generate Revenue We generate revenue from net interest income and from noninterest income. Net interest income represents the difference between the income earned on our assets, including our loans and investment securities, and our cost of funds, including the interest paid on the deposits and borrowings that are used to support our assets. Net interest income is a significant contributor to our operating results. Fluctuations in interest rates, as well as the amounts and types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities we hold, affect net interest income. The change in reportable business segment net interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily reflected decreases within our banking and broker-dealer segments, partially offset by a decrease in net interest expense within our mortgage origination segment. The other component of our revenue is noninterest income, which is primarily comprised of the following: (i) Income from broker-dealer operations. Through Securities Holdings, we provide investment banking and other related financial services that generated 195.8 million and 171.7 million in securities commissions and fees and investment and securities advisory fees and commissions, respectively, and 88.8 million and 87.8 million in gains from derivative and trading portfolio activities (included within other noninterest income), respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. (ii) Income from mortgage operations. Through PrimeLending, we generate noninterest income by originating and selling mortgage loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated 239.4 million and 247.5 million, respectively, in net gains from sale of loans, other mortgage production income (including income associated with retained mortgage servicing rights), and mortgage loan origination fees. In the aggregate, we experienced an increase in noninterest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, as noted in the segment results table previously presented, primarily due to an increase in gains from investment and securities advisory fees and commissions within our broker-dealer segment, an increase in net gains from sale of loans within our mortgage loan origination segment and an increase in pre-tax gains associated with the sale of merchant bank equity investments within corporate, partially offset by decreases of mortgage loan origination fees and other mortgage production income within our mortgage origination segment. We also incur noninterest expenses in the operation of our businesses. Our businesses engage in labor intensive activities and, consequently, employees compensation and benefits represent the majority of our noninterest expenses. Consolidated Operating Results Income applicable to common stockholders during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 29.7 million, or 0.46 per diluted share, compared with 37.0 million, or 0.57 per diluted share, during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income applicable to common stockholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 77.7 million, or 1.19 per diluted share, compared to 81.0 million, or 1.25 per diluted share, during nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Hilltop s financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, included a decline in net interest income, partially offset by changes in the provision for credit losses within the banking segment, an increase in net revenues in the structured finance and fixed income services business lines, a decline in net revenues in the wealth management business line and higher noninterest expenses within the broker-dealer segment, while the mortgage origination segment had declines in both noninterest income and expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, Hilltop s financial results included changes consistent with those noted above within our banking and mortgage origination segments, and within our broker-dealer segment an increase in net revenues in the structured finance business line, a decline in net revenues in the wealth management and fixed income services business lines and higher noninterest expenses within the broker-dealer segment. Certain items included in net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 resulted from purchase accounting associated with the merger of PlainsCapital Corporation with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Hilltop on November 30, 2012, the FDIC-assisted transaction whereby the Bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of FNB, the acquisition of SWS Group, Inc. in a stock and cash transaction, and the acquisition of The Bank of River Oaks in an all-cash transaction (collectively, the Bank Transactions ). Income before income taxes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included net accretion on earning assets and liabilities of 0.7 million and 2.5 million, respectively, and amortization of identifiable intangibles of 0.4 million and 0.7 million, respectively, related to the Bank Transactions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, income before income taxes included net accretion on earning assets and liabilities of 4.0 million and 7.6 million, respectively, and amortization of identifiable intangible of 1.5 million and 2.2 million, respectively, related to the Bank transactions. The information shown in the table below includes certain key performance indicators on a consolidated basis.

 (1) Return on average stockholders equity is defined as consolidated income attributable to Hilltop divided by average total Hilltop stockholders equity. (2) Return on average assets is defined as consolidated net income before noncontrolling interest divided by average assets. (3) Net interest margin is defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. We consider net interest margin as a key indicator of profitability, as it represents interest earned on our interest-earning assets compared to interest incurred. (4) The securities financing operations within our broker-dealer segment had the effect of lowering both the net interest margin and taxable equivalent net interest margin by 24 basis points and 25 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 25 basis points and 27 basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. (5) The leverage ratio is a regulatory capital ratio and is defined as Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by average consolidated assets. (6) The common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is a regulatory capital ratio and is defined as common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital divided by risk weighted assets. Common equity includes common equity Tier 1 capital (common stockholders equity and certain minority interests in the equity capital accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, but excluding goodwill and various intangible assets) and additional Tier 1 capital (certain qualifying minority interests not included in common equity Tier 1 capital, certain preferred stock and related surplus, and certain subordinated debt). We present net interest margin and net interest income below on a taxable-equivalent basis. Net interest margin (taxable equivalent), a non-GAAP measure, is defined as taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Taxable equivalent adjustments are based on the applicable corporate federal income tax rate of 21 for all periods presented. The Company performs periodic reviews of the classification and categorization of the components impacting the calculation of net interest margin. The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins for all earning assets, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, purchase accounting contributed 2 and 7 basis points, respectively, to our consolidated taxable equivalent net interest margin of 2.85 and 3.04 , respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, purchase accounting contributed 4 and 7 basis points, respectively, to our consolidated taxable equivalent net interest margin of 2.86 and 3.12 , respectively. The purchase accounting

 (1) Average balance includes non-accrual loans. (2) Presented on a taxable equivalent basis with annualized taxable equivalent adjustments based on the applicable corporate federal income tax rate of 21 for the periods presented. The adjustment to interest income was 0.6 million and 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.8 million and 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The banking segment s net interest margin exceeds our consolidated net interest margin shown above. Our consolidated net interest margin includes certain items that are not reflected in the calculation of our net interest margin within our banking segment and reduces our consolidated net interest margin, such as the borrowing costs of Hilltop and the yields and costs associated with certain items within interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such as securities borrowed in the broker-dealer segment and securities loaned in the broker-dealer segment, including items related to securities financing operations that particularly decrease net interest margin. In addition, yields and costs on certain interest-earning assets, such as lines of credit extended to other operating segments by the banking segment, are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. On a consolidated basis, the change in net interest income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to increased costs of deposits from rate increases and the shift from noninterest-bearing deposits into interest-bearing products during the year-over-year period, and increased net yields on loans held for investment within the banking segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to the discussion in the Banking Segment section that follows for more details on the changes in net interest income, including the component changes in the volume of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and changes in the rates earned or paid on those items. The provision for (reversal of) credit losses is determined by management as the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the amount of expected credit losses inherent within the loans held for investment portfolio. The amount of expense and the corresponding level of allowance for credit losses for loans are based on our evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other significant qualitative and quantitative factors. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses reflected a build in the allowance related to specific reserves and loan portfolio changes within the banking segment since the prior quarter, slightly offset by improvements to the U.S. economic outlook, while during the three months ended September 30, 2024, the reversal of credit losses was primarily driven by net charge-offs and loan

 portfolio changes, including a change in the macroeconomic outlook scenario utilized, associated with collectively evaluated loans, partially offset by a build in the allowance related to specific reserves within the banking segment since the prior quarter. The provision for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected a build in the allowance related to specific reserves and loan portfolio changes within the banking segment since the prior period, partially offset by the change in the macroeconomic outlook scenario utilized. Refer to the discussion under the heading Financial Condition Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans for more details regarding the significant assumptions and estimates involved in estimating credit losses. Noninterest income increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to net increases within the broker-dealer segment s structured finance and fixed income services business lines, partially offset by a decline within the broker-dealer segment s wealth management business line and a decline in mortgage loan origination fees within our mortgage origination segment. Noninterest income increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to net increases within the broker-dealer segment s structured finance and public finance services business lines, an increase in pre-tax gains associated with the sale of merchant bank equity investments within corporate, and increases in mortgage loan gains from sale of loans within our mortgage origination segment, partially offset by declines in mortgage loan origination fees and other related income within the mortgage origination segment and by declines within the broker-dealer segment s fixed income services and wealth management business lines. Noninterest expense increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in both variable and non-variable compensation and other segment operating costs within our broker-dealer segment, partially offset by decreases in both variable and non-variable compensation and other segment costs within our mortgage origination segment associated with decreased mortgage loan originations. Noninterest expense decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to changes noted above within our mortgage origination segment, partially offset by increases in both variable and non-variable compensation and other segment operating costs within our broker-dealer segment. We have experienced an increase in certain noninterest expenses during 2024 and 2023, compared with respective prior periods, including compensation, occupancy, and software costs, due to inflationary pressures. We expect such inflationary headwinds to continue and result in higher fixed costs during the remainder of 2024. Effective income tax rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 22.5 and 25.2 , respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 22.5 and 21.6 , respectively. The effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was higher than the applicable statutory rate primarily due to the impact of non-deductible compensation expense and other permanent adjustments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effective tax rate differed from the applicable statutory rate primarily due to the impacts of excess tax benefits on share-based payment awards, investments in tax-exempt instruments and changes in accumulated tax reserves, partially offset by nondeductible expenses and the booking of additional taxes from a recent change in the source of funding for an acquired non-qualified, deferred compensation plan. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was higher than the applicable statutory rate primarily due to the impact of nondeductible expenses, nondeductible compensation expense and other permanent adjustments, partially offset by the discrete impact of restricted stock vesting during the quarter and investments in tax-exempt instruments.

Changes to net interest income related to the component changes

Table of Contents 
 in the volume of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and changes in the rates earned or paid on those items are discussed in more detail below. As discussed in more detail below, the banking segment s cost of deposits increased during the first nine months of 2024, due to intense competition for liquidity and customers seeking higher yields on deposits. While we expect deposit costs during the remainder of 2024 to continue to be driven by various factors, including competitive pressures and broader economic conditions, with the recent 50-basis point decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate in September 2024 and the possibility of additional rate cuts in 2024, we anticipate that our cost of deposits will begin to trend modestly downward. The resulting net interest income spread compression has had, and is expected to continue to have, a negative impact on banking segment operating results. The information shown in the table below includes certain key indicators of the performance and asset quality of our banking segment. 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Efficiency ratio (1) 55.20 51.38 55.42 50.30 Return on average assets (2) 1.14 1.20 1.05 1.17 Net interest margin (3) 3.05 3.08 3.06 3.19 Net recoveries (charge-offs) to average loans outstanding (4) (0.15) 0.08 (0.13) (0.03) 

 (1) Efficiency ratio is defined as noninterest expenses divided by the sum of total noninterest income and net interest income for the period. We consider the efficiency ratio to be a measure of the banking segment s profitability. (2) Return on average assets is defined as net income before noncontrolling interest divided by average assets. (3) Net interest margin is defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. We consider net interest margin as a key indicator of profitability, as it represents interest earned on interest-earning assets compared to interest incurred. (4) Net recoveries (charge-offs) to average loans outstanding is defined as the greater of recoveries or charge-offs during the reported period minus charge-offs or recoveries divided by average loans outstanding. We use the ratio to measure the credit performance of our loan portfolio. The banking segment presents net interest margin and net interest income in the following discussion and table below on a taxable equivalent basis. Net interest margin (taxable equivalent), a non-GAAP measure, is defined as taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Taxable equivalent adjustments are based on the applicable corporate federal income tax rate of 21 for all periods presented. The banking segment performs periodic reviews of the classification and categorization of the components impacting the calculation of net interest margin. The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins for all earning assets, we use net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, purchase accounting contributed 3 and 8 basis points, respectively, to the banking segment s taxable equivalent net interest margin of 3.06 and 3.09 , respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, purchase accounting contributed 4 and 9 basis points, respectively, to the banking segment s taxable equivalent net interest margin of 3.06 and 3.20 , respectively. These purchase accounting items are primarily related to accretion of discount of loans associated with the Bank Transactions presented in the Consolidated Operating Results section.

 The banking segment s net interest margin exceeds our consolidated net interest margin. Our consolidated net interest margin includes certain items that are not reflected in the calculation of our net interest margin within our banking segment and reduce our consolidated net interest margin, such as the borrowing costs of Hilltop and the yields and costs associated with certain items within interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such as securities borrowed in the broker-dealer segment and securities loaned in the broker-dealer segment, including items related to securities financing operations that particularly decrease net interest margin. In addition, yields and costs on certain interest-earning assets, such as lines of credit extended to other operating segments by the banking segment, are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes the changes in the banking segment s net interest income for the periods indicated below, including the component changes in the volume of average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and changes in the rates earned or paid on those items (in thousands).

 (1) Changes attributable to both volume and yield/rate are included in yield/rate column. (2) Changes in the yields earned on loans held for investment, gross included declines of 1.5 million and 3.4 million, respectively, in accretion of discount on loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in 2023. Accretion of discount on loans is expected to decrease in future periods as loans acquired in the Bank Transactions are repaid, refinanced or renewed. (3) Subsidiary warehouse lines of credit extended to PrimeLending are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. (4) Annualized taxable equivalent. With regard to net interest income, as of September 30, 2024, the banking segment maintained an asset sensitive rate risk position, meaning the amount of its interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest-bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period. During a period of declining interest rates, being asset sensitive tends to result in a decrease in net interest income, but during a period of rising interest rates, being asset sensitive tends to result in an increase in net interest income. Given projected impacts on net interest income associated with the expected transition into the next phase of the interest rate cycle, we continue to evaluate our current GAP position, which may result in a repositioning of the banking segment towards a more neutral or liability sensitive balance sheet. The decreases in net interest income, as noted in the table above, were primarily driven by the increased funding costs on our deposit products from rate increases in 2023 and the migration from non-interest-bearing deposits into interest-bearing products during the year over year period, partially offset by increased earnings on interest-earning assets, primarily loan yields. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 50 basis points from 3.38 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.88 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while the average yield

Table of Contents 
 on interest-earning assets increased 32 basis points from 5.34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.66 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our portfolio includes loans that periodically reprice or mature prior to the end of an amortized term. The extent and timing of this impact on interest income will ultimately be driven by the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate and yield curve movements, as well as changes in market conditions and timing of management strategies. At September 30, 2024, approximately 599 million of our floating rate loans held for investment remained at or below their applicable rate floor, exclusive of our mortgage warehouse lending program, of which approximately 66 are not scheduled to reprice for more than one year based upon agreed-upon terms. If interest rates were to continue to fall, the impact on our interest income for certain variable-rate loans would be limited by these rate floors. If interest rates rise, yields on the portion of our loan portfolio that remain at applicable rate floors would rise more slowly than increases in market interest rates, unless such loans are refinanced or repaid. Competition for loan growth could also continue to put pressure on new loan origination rates. Additionally, within our banking segment, the composition of the deposit base and ultimate cost of funds on deposits and net interest income are affected by the level of market interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by competitors, the volatility of equity markets and other factors. Deposit products and pricing structures relative to the market are regularly evaluated to maintain competitiveness over time. As discussed above, our cost of deposits increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023. While we expect such costs during 2024 to continue to be driven by various factors, including competitive pressures and broader economic conditions, with the recent 50-basis point decrease in the target range of the federal funds rate in September 2024 and the possibility of additional rate cuts in 2024, we anticipate that our cost of deposits will begin to trend modestly downward. The Bank s deposit base primarily includes a combination of commercial, wealth and public funds deposits, without a high level of industry concentration. At September 30, 2024, total estimated uninsured deposits were 5.3 billion, or approximately 49 of total deposits, while estimated uninsured deposits, excluding collateralized deposits of 312.3 million, were 5.0 billion, or approximately 46 of total deposits. Refer to the discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources Banking Segment section that follows for more detail regarding the Bank s activities regarding deposits, available liquidity and borrowing capacity. To help mitigate net interest income spread volatility between our assets and liabilities, management maintains derivative trades, as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges, that better align repricing characteristics. Despite having these hedges in place, changes in interest rates across the term structure may continue to impact net interest income and net interest margin. The impact of rate movements will change with the shape of the yield curve, including any changes in steepness or flatness and inversions at any points on the yield curve. The banking segment retained approximately 7.3 million and 8.8 million in mortgage loans originated by the mortgage origination segment during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 79.2 million and 135.2 million in mortgage loans originated by the mortgage origination segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These loans are purchased by the banking segment at par. For origination services provided, the banking segment reimburses the mortgage origination segment for direct origination costs associated with these mortgage loans, in addition to payment of a correspondent fee. The correspondent fees are eliminated in consolidation. The determination of mortgage loan retention levels by the banking segment will be impacted by, among other things, an ongoing review of the prevailing mortgage rates, balance sheet positioning at Hilltop and the banking segment s outlook for commercial loan growth. The banking segment s provision for (reversal of) credit losses has been subject to significant year-over-year and quarterly changes primarily attributable to the effects of changes in economic outlook, macroeconomic forecast assumptions and the resulting impact on reserves. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the reversal of credit losses was primarily driven by net charge-offs and loan portfolio changes, including a change in the macroeconomic outlook scenario utilized, associated with collectively evaluated loans, partially offset by a build in the allowance related to specific reserves within the banking segment since the prior quarter. The increase in the provision for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected a build in the allowance related to specific reserves and loan portfolio changes within the banking segment since the prior period, partially offset by the change in the macroeconomic outlook scenario utilized. The net impact to the allowance of changes associated with individually evaluated loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a provision for credit losses of 1.2 million and 13.3 million, respectively, while collectively evaluated loans included a reversal of credit losses of

Table of Contents 
 2.5 million and 6.5 million, respectively. The change in the allowance for credit losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also impacted by net charge-offs of 2.9 million and 7.3 million, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the banking segment s provision for credit losses reflected increases in specific reserves and net portfolio changes since the prior period, while the provision for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflected a significant build in the allowance related to loan portfolio changes since December 31, 2022 and a deteriorating outlook for commercial real estate markets. The net impact to the allowance of changes associated with collectively evaluated loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a reversal of credit losses of 0.3 million, compared to a provision for credit losses of 14.2 million, respectively, while individually evaluated loans included a provision for credit losses of 0.9 million and 3.0 million, respectively. The change in the allowance for credit losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were also impacted by net recoveries of 1.6 million and net charge-offs of 1.7 million, respectively . The changes in the allowance for credit losses during the noted periods also reflected other factors including, but not limited to, loan growth, loan mix and changes in risk grades and qualitative factors from the prior quarter. Refer to the discussion in the Financial Condition Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans section that follows for more details regarding the significant assumptions and estimates involved in estimating credit losses. The banking segment s noninterest income decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in oil and gas management fees. The decrease in noninterest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to valuation adjustments associated with the sale of a single loan from loans held for sale during the second quarter of 2024. The banking segment s noninterest expense increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in employees compensation and benefits and occupancy and equipment expenses, partially offset by decreases in professional fees. The increase in noninterest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to one-time compensation expenses associated with Bank leadership changes, partially offset by decreases in professional fees.

 (1) Securities commissions and fees includes income from FDIC sweep investments with the banking segment of 6.6 million and 12.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 19.7 million and 35.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that is eliminated in consolidation. (2) Net revenue is defined as the sum of total net interest income and total noninterest income. We consider net revenue to be a key performance measure in the evaluation of the broker-dealer segment s financial position and operating performance as we believe it is the primary revenue performance measure used by investors and analysts. Net revenue provides for some level of comparability of trends across the financial services industry as it reflects both noninterest income, including investment and securities advisory fees and commissions, as well as net interest income. Internally, we assess the broker-dealer segment s performance on a revenue basis for comparability with our banking segment. (3) Variable compensation represents performance-based commissions and incentives. (4) Segment operating costs include provision for (reversal of) credit losses associated with the broker-dealer segment within other noninterest expenses. (5) During the second quarter of 2024, the Company identified an immaterial error related to the classification within noninterest income associated with the allocation of earned revenue between commission and principal gains on certain principal trades of fixed income securities. As a result, certain prior period amounts within securities commissions and fees noninterest income and other noninterest income have been corrected for consistency with the current period presentation. The changes in net revenue and income before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, were primarily due to improved period-over-period results within our structured finance and public finance services business lines, partially offset by declines within our fixed income services and wealth management business lines. The increase in the structured finance business line s net revenues was primarily due to an increase in unrealized gains from the U.S. Agency to-be-announced TBA business and commissions earned on commodities transactions. The increase in net revenues in the broker-dealer segment s public finance services business line was primarily due to fees earned from managed assets and municipal advisory revenues. The wealth management business line s net revenue decrease was driven by decreases in commissions earned from our FDIC sweep program on lower customer balances. These decreases were partially offset by improved advisory fees revenues generated from customer assets under management. The decrease in net revenues in the broker-dealer segment s fixed income services business line was primarily due to declines in revenues from net interest income earned on inventory positions and

 trading profits, particularly from a decrease in underwriting activities. Income before income taxes was impacted by increased noninterest expense primarily due to increased segment compensation. The changes in net revenue and income before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, were primarily due to improved period-over-period results within our structured finance and fixed income services business lines, partially offset by declines within our wealth management business line. Public finance remained relatively flat period-over-period. The structured finance business line s net revenues increase was primarily due to an increase in our structured housing business due to gains from the U.S. Agency TBA business and commissions earned on commodities transactions. The wealth management business line s net revenue decline was driven by a reduction in the FDIC program sweep revenue resulting from an overall decrease in customer assets. These decreases were partially offset by improved advisory fees revenues generated from customer assets under management. The increase in net revenues in the broker-dealer segment s fixed income services business line was primarily due to increases in revenues from net interest income earned on inventory positions and investment banking and advisory fees, partially offset from decreases in trading profits from underwriting activities. The broker-dealer segment is subject to interest rate risk as a consequence of maintaining inventory positions, trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments and maintaining a matched stock loan book. Changes in interest rates are likely to have a meaningful impact on our overall financial performance. Our broker-dealer segment has historically earned a significant portion of its revenues from advisory fees upon the successful completion of client transactions, which could be adversely impacted by interest rate volatility. Rapid or significant changes in interest rates could adversely affect the broker-dealer segment s bond trading, sales, underwriting activities and other interest spread-sensitive activities described below. The broker-dealer segment also receives administrative fees for providing money market and FDIC investment alternatives to clients, which tend to be sensitive to short-term interest rates. In addition, the profitability of the broker-dealer segment depends, to an extent, on the spread between revenues earned on customer loans and excess customer cash balances, and the interest expense paid on customer cash balances, as well as the interest revenue earned on trading securities, net of financing costs. The broker-dealer segment is also exposed to interest rate risk through its structured finance business line, which is dependent on mortgage loan production that tends to be adversely impacted by increasing interest rates and resulting in valuation-related adjustments. In the broker-dealer segment, interest is earned from securities lending activities, interest charged on customer margin loan balances and interest earned on investment securities used to support sales, underwriting and other customer activities. The decrease in net interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, was primarily due to the decrease in net interest income from the fixed income services business line due to decreases in net interest earned on inventory positions. Net interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023 remained relatively flat. Noninterest income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in 2023, due to increases in securities commissions and fees, investment and securities advisory fees and other income. Securities commissions and fees increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in commodities and insurance product sales commissions, partially offset by decreases in FDIC sweep revenues and net clearing revenues. Securities commissions and fees increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023 due to increases in both the broker-dealer segment s structured finance and fixed income services business lines. The increase in the structured finance business line was primarily due to an increase in commissions earned on commodities transactions, and the increase in the fixed income services business line was primarily due to increased volumes. These increases were partially offset by declines in securities commissions and fees in the broker-dealer segment s wealth management business line due to decreases in FDIC sweep revenues and net clearing revenues, as well as a decline in commissions earned on insurance product sales. Investment and securities advisory fees and commissions increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increases in fees earned from managed assets and municipal advisory transactions. The increases in other noninterest income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in 2023, were primarily due to increases in trading gains earned from structured finance trading activities and distributions received on investments, partially offset by decreases in trading gains earned from fixed

 income trading activities. Both mortgage originations and buy-side demand have increased in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, resulting in increases in noninterest income in the structured finance service line for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023. Decreased fixed income trading gains for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in 2023, were primarily driven by municipal and taxable securities trading. The increases in noninterest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in 2023, were primarily due to increases in segment compensation and other segment operating costs, primarily quotation expenses. Selected information concerning the broker-dealer segment, including key performance indicators, follows (dollars in thousands).

 (1) Total compensation includes the sum of non-variable compensation and benefits and variable compensation. We consider total compensation as a percentage of net revenue to be a key performance measure and indicator of segment profitability. (2) Pre-tax margin is defined as income before income taxes divided by net revenue. We consider pre-tax margin to be a key performance measure given its use as a profitability metric representing the percentage of net revenue earned that results in a profit. (3) Noted balances during all prior periods include certain reclassifications to conform to current period presentation. Mortgage Origination Segment The following table presents certain information regarding the operating results of our mortgage origination segment (in thousands). 

Three Months Ended September 30, Variance Nine Months Ended September 30, Variance 2024 2023 2024 vs 2023 2024 2023 2024 vs 2023 Net interest income (expense) (4,417) (5,482) 1,065 (13,240) (15,590) 2,350 Noninterest income 79,922 88,747 (8,825) 239,489 247,655 (8,166) Noninterest expense 84,223 91,505 (7,282) 250,067 278,918 (28,851) Loss before income taxes (8,718) (8,240) (478) (23,818) (46,853) 23,035 The mortgage lending business is subject to variables that can impact loan origination volume, including seasonal transaction volumes and interest rate fluctuations. Historically, the mortgage origination segment has experienced increased loan origination volume from purchases of homes during the spring and summer months, when more people tend to move and buy or sell homes. An increase in mortgage interest rates tends to result in decreased loan origination volume from refinancings, while a decrease in mortgage interest rates tends to result in increased loan origination volume from refinancings. While changes in mortgage interest rates have historically had a lesser impact on home purchases volume than on refinancing volume, net increases in mortgage interest rates since 2022 have continued to negatively impact home purchase volume through the first nine months of 2024. A modest decline in mortgage rates experienced since the fourth

Table of Contents 
 quarter of 2023 has had a slight impact on loan origination volume in 2024, with a minor increase in refinancings as a percentage of total loan origination volume. See details regarding loan origination volume in the table below. Recent trends, as well as typical historical patterns in loan origination volume from purchases of homes or from refinancings because of movements in mortgage interest rates, may not be indicative of future loan origination volumes. During 2023, and continuing through the first nine months of 2024, certain events have adversely impacted total mortgage market origination volumes because of their effect on the economy, including inflation and an increase in average interest rates during these periods when compared to the average of the three years prior to 2023, geopolitical events, and the Federal Reserve s actions and communications. These events have also adversely impacted the willingness and ability of the mortgage origination segment s customers to conduct mortgage transactions. Specifically, current home inventory shortages and affordability challenges are impacting customers abilities to purchase homes. In September 2024, the Federal Reserve cut the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 4.75 - 5.0 , the first reduction since March 2022 when the target range was 0.25 - 0.50 . Since this cut occurred during the later part of the third quarter of 2024, it had minimal impact on loan origination volumes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect the fourth quarter of 2024 to more closely follow loan production experienced during the first quarter of 2024. PrimeLending continues to evaluate its cost structure to address the current mortgage environment. We believe that ongoing initiatives are critical to improving PrimeLending s short- and long-term financial condition and operating results. The mortgage origination segment experienced operating losses during 2023 due to conditions and challenges discussed in detail within this discussion of segment results. Operating losses have continued into the first nine months of 2024 due to the same conditions and challenges, but at a lesser extent than during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In light of these macroeconomic challenges in the mortgage industry including tight housing inventories and mortgage interest rate levels, the fair value of the mortgage origination reporting unit may decline, and we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge. These conditions will continue to be considered during future impairment evaluations of reporting unit goodwill. As a Government National Mortgage Association GNMA approved lender, we are subject to certain Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD and GNMA minimum capital ratio reporting requirements, including timely reporting if a quarter s operating loss exceeds more than 20 of its previous quarter or year-end net worth (the operating loss ratio and/or if a quarter s capital ratio is below 6 (the GNMA capital ratio ). If this occurs, certain additional financial reporting submissions are required. During the first and fourth quarters of 2023, the HUD operating loss ratio was 21.2 and 20.5 , respectively, while during the second and third quarters of 2023, the HUD operating loss ratio decreased to 15.8 and 10.0 , respectively. During the first quarter of 2024, the HUD operating loss ratio was 22.6 , while during the second quarter of 2024, PrimeLending reported a HUD operating gain. During the third quarter of 2024, the operating loss ratio was below the 20 threshold at 14.4 . During each quarter of 2023, the GNMA capital ratio exceeded the required 6 . However, during the first and second quarters of 2024, the GNMA capital ratio decreased to 5.56 and 4.41 , respectively. Including a 10 million capital infusion received by PrimeLending from its parent company, PlainsCapital Bank, in September 2024, the GNMA capital ratio increased to 6.38 . All trends requiring notification to GNMA and HUD have been reported to those entities, respectively. Such capital infusions are likely in future periods, including those in the near-term, based on various factors including PrimeLending s financial performance. In addition, as a Federal National Mortgage Association FNMA and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC approved lender, we are subject to certain minimum capital, net worth and liquidity requirements established by FNMA and FHLMC, including maintaining a minimum capital ratio of 6 (the FNMA/FHLMC capital ratio ). During each quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, the FNMA/FHLMC capital ratio exceeded the required 6 , however during the second quarter of 2024, the FNMA/FHLMC capital ratio decreased to 5.52 . During the third quarter of 2024, the capital ratio, including the capital infusion previously noted, exceeded the required 6 . FNMA and FHLMC may also monitor additional financial performance trends at their discretion, including risk-based analyses focused on loans that the mortgage origination segment is currently responsible for representations and warranties that agency loans sold meet certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan. One FNMA discretionary performance trend monitors the change in adjusted net worth during the prior twelve months. FNMA s acceptable threshold for this performance trend is less than minus 30 , but is only considered if a company has four consecutive quarterly losses. During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2023, PrimeLending experienced four consecutive quarterly losses; the loss ratio during these periods were 50.2 , 37.6 and 39.8 , respectively. PrimeLending also recognized four consecutive quarterly losses during the first, second and third quarters of 2024; the loss ratio during these periods was 37.5 , 29.9 and 23.9 , respectively. All trends requiring notification to FNMA and FHLMC have been reported to those entities, respectively.

 The loss before income taxes during the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximated the loss before income taxes PrimeLending reported during the same period in 2023. Decreases in noninterest income and noninterest expense approximated each other during these periods. The loss before income taxes decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease in noninterest expense. During 2022 and continuing through the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023, the U.S. 10-Year Treasury Rate and mortgage interest rates increased significantly. During the later part of the fourth quarter of 2023, both rates decreased to levels that approximated rates at the beginning of 2023. Between January 1 and September 30, 2024, both rates decreased slightly. Average interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased slightly compared to average interest rates during the same period in 2023, while average interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were comparable to the same period in 2023. Refinancing volume as a percentage of total origination volume was slightly higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. Although we anticipate a slightly higher percentage of refinancing volume relative to total loan origination volume during 2024, as compared to 2023, an even higher refinance percentage could be driven by a slowing of purchase volume due to the negative impact on new and existing home sales resulting from existing home inventory shortages and affordability challenges related to new home construction, and/or an increase in all-cash buyers. The mortgage origination segment primarily originates its mortgage loans through a retail channel, with limited lending through its affiliated business arrangements ABAs ). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, funded volume through ABAs was approximately 15 of the mortgage origination segment s total loan volume. Currently, PrimeLending owns a greater than 50 membership interest in two ABAs. We expect total production within the ABA channel to continue to approximate 15 of loan volume of the mortgage origination segment during the remainder of 2024. The following table provides further details regarding our mortgage loan originations and sales for the periods indicated below (dollars in thousands).

Loan origination volume is central to the segment s ability to generate income by originating and selling mortgage loans, resulting in net gains from the sale of loans, mortgage loan origination fees, and other mortgage production income.

 Total loan origination volume is a measure utilized by management, our investors, and analysts in assessing market share and growth of the mortgage origination segment. The mortgage origination segment s total loan origination volume increased 2.8 and decreased 1.0 , respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The loss before taxes increased 5.8 and decreased 49.2 , respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in loss before income taxes during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to an increase in the loss on the change in the net fair value and related derivative activity related to mortgage servicing rights assets and a decrease in servicing fees, almost entirely offset by decreases in non-variable compensation and benefits expense, segment operating costs, and servicing fee expense. The decrease in loss before income taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to decreases in non-variable compensation and benefits expense and segment operating costs, partially offset by an increase in the loss on the change in the net fair value and related derivative activity related to mortgage servicing rights assets. The information shown in the table below includes certain additional key performance indicators for the mortgage origination segment.

Net interest expense was comprised of interest income earned on loans held for sale offset by interest incurred on warehouse lines of credit primarily held with the Bank, and related intercompany financing costs. Net interest expense decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in the negative net interest margin. Noninterest income was comprised of the items set forth in the table below (in thousands).

The increase in net gains from sales of loans was primarily the result of an increase in average loan sale margin. The 16.8 decrease in mortgage loan origination fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, was primarily the result of a decrease in average mortgage loan origination fees as loan origination volume was flat during the same period, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in loan origination volume during both periods. Fluctuations in mortgage loan origination fees and net gains on sale of loans are not always aligned with fluctuations in loan origination and loan sale volumes, respectively, since customers may opt to pay PrimeLending discount fees on their mortgage loans, which are included in mortgage loan origination fees, in exchange for a lower interest rate, which decreases the value of a loan in the secondary market.

 We consider the mortgage origination segment s net gains from sale of loans margin, in basis points, to be a key performance measure. Net gains from mortgage loan sales margin is defined as net gains from sale of loans divided by mortgage loan sales volume. The net gains from sale of loans is central to the segment s generation of income and may include loans sold to third parties and loans sold to and retained by the banking segment. For origination services provided, the mortgage origination segment was reimbursed direct origination costs associated with loans retained by the banking segment, in addition to payment of a correspondent fee. The reimbursed origination costs and correspondent fees are included in the mortgage origination segment operating results, and the correspondent fees are eliminated in consolidation. Loan volumes to be originated on behalf of and retained by the banking segment are evaluated each quarter. Loans sold to and retained by the banking segment during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 7.3 million and 8.8 million, respectively, and 79.2 million and 135.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Loan volumes to be originated on behalf of and retained by the banking segment are expected to be impacted by, among other things, an ongoing review of the prevailing mortgage rates, balance sheet positioning at Hilltop and the banking segment s outlook for commercial loan growth. Noninterest income included changes in the net fair value of the mortgage origination segment s interest rate lock commitments IRLCs and loans held for sale and the related activity associated with forward commitments used by the mortgage origination segment to mitigate interest rate risk associated with its IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale net fair value of IRLCs and loans held for sale ). The decrease in net fair value of IRLCs and loans held for sale during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was the result of a decrease in the total volume of individual IRLCs and loans held for sale since June 30, 2024, while the average value of individual IRLCs and loans held for sale was flat since June 30, 2024. The increase in net fair value of IRLCs and loans held for sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was the result of an increase in the total volume of individual IRLCs and loans held for sale and the average value of individual IRLCs and loans held for sale since December 31, 2023. The mortgage origination segment sells substantially all mortgage loans it originates to various investors in the secondary market. In addition, the mortgage origination segment originates loans on behalf of the Bank. The mortgage origination segment s determination of whether to retain or release servicing on mortgage loans it sells is impacted by, among other things, changes in mortgage interest rates, refinancing and market activity, and balance sheet positioning at Hilltop. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, PrimeLending retained servicing on approximately 6 and 8 , respectively, of the loans sold, compared with approximately 9 and 20 , respectively, of loans sold during the same periods in 2023. A reduction in third-party mortgage servicers purchasing mortgage servicing rights, even if modest, may result in PrimeLending increasing the rate of retained servicing on mortgage loans sold at any time. The mortgage origination segment may, from time to time, manage its MSR asset through different strategies, including varying the percentage of mortgage loans sold, servicing released and opportunistically selling MSR assets. The mortgage origination segment has also retained servicing on certain loans sold to and retained by the banking segment. Gains and losses associated with such sales to the banking segment and the related MSR asset are eliminated in consolidation. The mortgage origination segment uses derivative financial instruments, including U.S. Treasury bond futures and options and MBS commitments, to mitigate interest rate risk associated with its MSR asset. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, changes in the net fair value of the MSR asset and the related derivatives resulted in net losses of 5.5 million and 18.6 million, respectively. In addition to normal customer payments and customer payoffs, these changes were primarily driven by losses of 4.2 million and 12.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, to account for MSR valuation assumption changes, including prepayment and discount rates used as inputs to value the MSR asset, and differences between MSR carrying values and sales prices related to the sale of MSR assets. Fluctuations in the net fair value of the MSR asset driven by net changes in long-term U.S. Treasury bond rates and the related derivatives used to hedge the MSR during the respective periods resulted in net losses of 0.7 million and 3.0 million, respectively. During June 2024, the mortgage origination segment sold MSR assets of 45.1 million, which represented 2.9 billion of its serviced loan volume at the time. In addition, on September 17, 2024, the mortgage origination segment signed a letter of intent to sell MSR assets of 42.6 million, which represented 2.3 billion of its serviced loan volume and is scheduled to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result, the mortgage origination segment does not currently expect the level of MSR assets to be significant in the short-term. In addition to gains and losses generated by changes in the net fair value of the MSR asset and related derivatives, net servicing income of 1.5 million and 8.7 million was recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the operating results of the mortgage origination segment were impacted by an increase of 6.1 million and a decrease of 0.7 million, respectively, in the net fair value of the MSR asset, of which 5.5 million of the decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by market sales trends during the first quarter of 2023. The remaining fluctuations in the net fair value of the MSR asset during the respective periods were primarily due to the net gains driven by the net changes in long-term U.S. Treasury bond rates and customer payoffs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and losses of 9.1 million and 12.3 million generated by the derivatives used to hedge the MSR. During June 2023, the mortgage origination segment sold MSR assets of 19.1 million, which represented 991.0 million of its serviced loan volume at the time. In addition to gains and losses generated by changes in the net fair value of the MSR asset, net servicing income of 3.7 million and 10.5 million was recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Noninterest expenses were comprised of the items set forth in the table below (in thousands). 

Three Months Ended September 30, Variance Nine Months Ended September 30, Variance 2024 2023 2024 vs 2023 2024 2023 2024 vs 2023 Variable compensation 33,862 33,070 792 90,934 94,892 (3,958) Non-variable compensation and benefits 26,711 30,946 (4,235) 83,957 102,461 (18,504) Segment operating costs 18,205 21,471 (3,266) 56,952 64,125 (7,173) Lender paid closing costs 2,840 1,179 1,661 6,093 3,741 2,352 Servicing expense 2,605 4,839 (2,234) 12,131 13,699 (1,568) Total noninterest expense 84,223 91,505 (7,282) 250,067 278,918 (28,851) Total employees compensation and benefits accounted for the majority of noninterest expenses incurred during all periods presented. Historically, variable compensation comprises the majority of total employees compensation and benefits expenses. Variable compensation, which is primarily driven by loan origination volume, tends to fluctuate to a greater degree than loan origination volume, because mortgage loan originator and fulfillment staff incentive compensation plans are structured to pay at increasing rates as higher monthly volume tiers are achieved. However, certain other incentive compensation plans driven by non-mortgage production criteria may alter this trend. While total loan origination volume increased 2.8 and decreased 1.0 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, the aggregate non-variable compensation and benefits of the mortgage origination segment decreased by 13.7 and 18.1 during the same periods. These decreases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, were primarily due to a decrease in salaries associated with a reduction in underwriting and loan fulfillment, operations and corporate staff as PrimeLending continued to evaluate its cost structure to address the current mortgage environment. Segment operating costs decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to decreases in occupancy and equipment expense. In exchange for a higher interest rate, customers may opt to have PrimeLending pay certain costs associated with the origination of their mortgage loans lender paid closing costs ). Fluctuations in lender paid closing costs are not always aligned with fluctuations in loan origination volume. Other loan pricing conditions, including the mortgage loan interest rate, loan origination fees paid by the customer, and a customer s willingness to pay closing costs, may influence fluctuations in lender paid closing costs. Between January 1, 2015 and September 30, 2024, the mortgage origination segment sold mortgage loans totaling 144.1 billion. These loans were sold under sales contracts that generally include provisions that hold the mortgage origination segment responsible for errors or omissions relating to its representations and warranties that loans sold meet certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan. In addition, the sales contracts typically require the refund of purchased servicing rights plus certain investor servicing costs if a loan experiences an early payment default. While the mortgage origination segment sold loans prior to 2015, it does not anticipate experiencing significant losses in the future on loans originated prior to 2015 as a result of investor claims under these provisions of its sales contracts. When a claim for indemnification of a loan sold is made by an agency, investor, or other party, the mortgage origination segment evaluates the claim and determines if the claim can be satisfied through additional documentation or other deliverables. If the claim is valid and cannot be satisfied in that manner, the mortgage origination segment negotiates

Table of Contents 
 with the claimant to reach a settlement of the claim. Settlements typically result in either the repurchase of a loan or reimbursement to the claimant for losses incurred on the loan. The following is a summary of the mortgage origination segment s claims resolution activity relating to loans sold between January 1, 2015 and September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands). 

Original Loan Balance Loss Recognized of of Amount Loans Sold Amount Loans Sold Claims resolved with no payment 227,260 0.16 - Claims resolved because of a loan repurchase or payment to an investor for losses incurred (1) 328,167 0.23 26,041 0.02 555,427 0.39 26,041 0.02 

 (1) Losses incurred include refunded purchased servicing rights. For each loan, when the mortgage origination segment concludes its obligation to a claimant is both probable and reasonably estimable, the mortgage origination segment has established a specific claims indemnification liability reserve. An additional indemnification liability reserve has been established for probable agency, investor or other party losses that may have been incurred, but not yet reported to the mortgage origination segment based upon a reasonable estimate of such losses. Factors considered in the calculation of this reserve include, but are not limited to, the total volume of loans sold exclusive of specific claimant requests, actual claim inquiries, claim settlements and the severity of estimated losses resulting from future claims, and the mortgage origination segment s history of successfully curing defects identified in claim requests. Although management considers the total indemnification liability reserve to be appropriate, there may be changes in the reserve over time to address incurred losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy and historical loss patterns, discrete events adversely affecting specific borrowers or industries, and/or actions taken by institutions or investors. The impact of such matters is considered in the reserving process when probable and estimable. During the second quarter of 2024, PrimeLending increased the indemnification reserve rate applied to loans sold subsequent to April 30, 2024, to address recent loss trends. During the third quarter of 2024, there was no adjustment made to the indemnification liability reserve. PrimeLending will continue to monitor agency claim inquiry trends and assess its potential impact on the indemnification liability reserve. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the mortgage origination segment s total indemnification liability reserve totaled 8.5 million and 11.7 million, respectively. The related provision for indemnification losses was 0.9 million and 0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2.0 million and 1.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Corporate The following table presents certain financial information regarding the operating results of corporate (in thousands).

These activities include holding company financing and investing activities, merchant banking investment opportunities and management and administrative services to support the overall operations of the Company. Hilltop s merchant banking investment activities include the identification of attractive opportunities for capital deployment in companies engaged in non-financial activities through its merchant bank subsidiary, Hilltop Opportunity Partners LLC. These merchant banking activities currently include investments within various industries, including power generation, youth sports and entertainment, dental health, and industrial equipment manufacturing, with an aggregate carrying value of approximately 75 million at September 30, 2024.

 As a holding company, Hilltop s primary investment objectives are to support capital deployment for organic growth and to preserve capital to be deployed through acquisitions, dividend payments and potential stock repurchases. Investment and interest income earned during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily comprised of dividend income from merchant banking investment activities, in addition to interest income earned on intercompany notes. Interest expense during each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included recurring quarterly interest expense of 5.0 million incurred on our 150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5 senior notes due 2025 Senior Notes ), on our 50 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes due 2030 2030 Subordinated Notes and on our 150 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes due 2035 2035 Subordinated Notes, the 2030 Subordinated Notes and the 2035 Subordinated Notes, collectively, the Subordinated Notes ). Noninterest income during each period included activity related to our investment in a real estate development in Dallas University Park, which also serves as headquarters for both Hilltop and the Bank, and net noninterest income associated with activity within our merchant bank subsidiary. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income included pre-tax gains of 0.6 million and 5.3 million, respectively, associated with the sale of merchant bank equity investments. Noninterest expenses were primarily comprised of employees compensation and benefits, occupancy expenses and professional fees, including corporate governance, legal and transaction costs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expenses increased, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increases associated with employees compensation and benefits and software costs. Financial Condition The following discussion contains a more detailed analysis of our financial condition at September 30, 2024, as compared with December 31, 2023. Securities Portfolio At September 30, 2024, investment securities consisted of securities of the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government and its agencies, obligations of municipalities and other political subdivisions, primarily in the State of Texas, as well as mortgage-backed, corporate debt, and equity securities. We may categorize investments as trading, available for sale, held to maturity and equity securities. Trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term and are carried at fair value, marked to market through operations and held at the Bank and the Hilltop Broker-Dealers. Securities classified as available for sale may, from time to time, be bought and sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in securities prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, general liquidity needs and to take advantage of market conditions that create more economically attractive returns. Such securities are carried at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Equity investments are carried at fair value, with all changes in fair value recognized in net income. Securities are classified as held to maturity based on the intent and ability of our management, at the time of purchase, to hold such securities to maturity. These securities are carried at amortized cost.

Equity securities included net unrealized gains of 0.2 million and 0.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In future periods, we expect changes in prevailing market interest rates, coupled with changes in the aggregate size of the investment portfolio, to be significant drivers of changes in the unrealized losses or gains in these portfolios, and therefore accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Banking Segment The banking segment s securities portfolio plays a role in the management of our interest rate sensitivity and generates additional interest income. In addition, the securities portfolio is used to meet collateral requirements for public and trust deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other purposes. The available for sale and equity securities portfolios serve as a source of liquidity. Historically, the Bank s policy has been to invest primarily in securities of the U.S. government and its agencies, obligations of municipalities in the State of Texas and other high grade fixed income securities to minimize credit risk. At September 30, 2024, the banking segment s securities portfolio of 2.1 billion was comprised of trading securities of 0.1 million, available for sale securities of 1.4 billion, held to maturity securities of 754.8 million and equity securities of 0.3 million, in addition to 10.4 million of other investments included in other assets within the consolidated balance sheets.

 Broker-Dealer Segment The broker-dealer segment holds securities to support sales, underwriting and other customer activities. The interest rate risk inherent in holding these securities is managed by setting and monitoring limits on the size and duration of positions and on the length of time the securities can be held. The Hilltop Broker-Dealers are required to carry their securities at fair value and record changes in the fair value of the portfolio to the statement of operations. Accordingly, the securities portfolio of the Hilltop Broker-Dealers included trading securities of 540.8 million at September 30, 2024. In addition, the Hilltop Broker-Dealers enter into transactions that represent commitments to purchase and deliver securities at prevailing future market prices to facilitate customer transactions and satisfy such commitments. Accordingly, the Hilltop Broker-Dealers ultimate obligation may exceed the amount recognized in the financial statements. These securities, which are carried at fair value and reported as securities sold, not yet purchased in the consolidated balance sheets, had a value of 47.8 million at September 30, 2024. Corporate At September 30, 2024, the corporate portfolio included other investments, including those associated with merchant banking, of available for sale securities of 29.1 million and other assets of 45.3 million within the consolidated balance sheets. Allowance for Credit Losses for Available for Sale Securities and Held to Maturity Securities We have evaluated available for sale debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position and have determined that any declines in value are unrelated to credit loss and related to changes in market interest rates since purchase. None of the available for sale debt securities held were past due at September 30, 2024. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we evaluated our held to maturity debt securities, considering the current credit ratings and recognized losses, and determined the potential credit loss to be minimal. With respect to these securities, we considered the risk of credit loss to be negligible, and therefore, no allowance was recognized on the debt securities portfolio at September 30, 2024. Loan Portfolio Consolidated loans held for investment are detailed in the table below, classified by portfolio segment (in thousands).

The overall economic strength of the banking segment generally parallels the quality and yield of its loan portfolio. As discussed in more detail within the section captioned Financial Condition Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K and further within the section captioned Financial Condition Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans below, the banking segment s credit policies emphasize strong underwriting and governance standards and early detection of potential problem credits in order to develop and implement action plans on a timely basis to mitigate potential losses. To manage the credit risks associated with its loan portfolio, management may, depending upon current or anticipated economic conditions and related exposures, apply enhanced risk management measures to loans through analysis of a

 specific borrower s financial condition, including cash flow, collateral values, and guarantees, among other credit factors. Given the current market dynamics, including economic uncertainties, the heightened level of market interest rates since 2022, and a deteriorating outlook for commercial real estate markets, management has heightened its specific review procedures of credits maturing in the next six to twelve months as well as those credits associated with real estate. The banking segment s total loans held for investment, net of the allowance for credit losses, were 8.3 billion and 8.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the banking segment s loan portfolio included warehouse lines of credit extended to PrimeLending and its ABAs of 1.3 billion, of which 758.7 million was drawn. At December 31, 2023, amounts drawn on the available warehouse lines of credit was 0.9 billion. Amounts advanced against the warehouse lines of credit are eliminated from net loans held for investment on our consolidated balance sheets. The banking segment does not generally participate in syndicated loan transactions and has no foreign loans in its portfolio. A significant portion of the banking segment s loan portfolio at September 30, 2024, consisted of commercial real estate loans secured by properties. Such loans can involve high principal loan amounts, and the repayment of these loans is dependent, in large part, on a borrower s ongoing business operations or on income generated from the properties that are leased to third parties. The table below sets forth the banking segment s commercial real estate loan portfolio, by portfolio industry sector and collateral location as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands).

The areas of concentration within our real estate portfolio were non-construction commercial real estate loans, non-construction residential real estate loans, and construction and land development loans, which represented 43.2 , 23.2 and 11.4 , respectively, of the banking segment s total loans held for investment at September 30, 2024. The banking segment s loan concentrations were within regulatory guidelines at September 30, 2024. In addition, the Bank s loan portfolio includes collateralized loans extended to businesses that depend on the energy industry, including those within the exploration and production, field services, pipeline construction and transportation sectors. Crude oil prices remain uncertain given future supply and demand for oil are influenced by international armed conflicts, return to business travel, new energy policies and government regulation, and the pace of transition towards renewable energy resources. At September 30, 2024, the Bank s energy loan exposure was approximately 53 million of loans held for investment with unfunded commitment balances of approximately 15 million. The allowance for credit losses on the Bank s energy portfolio was 0.2 million, or 0.4 of loans held for investment at September 30, 2024.

The majority of floating rate loans carry an interest rate tied to a SOFR rate or The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, as published in The Wall Street Journal. Broker-Dealer Segment The loan portfolio of the broker-dealer segment consists primarily of margin loans to customers and correspondents that are due within one year. The interest rate on margin accounts is computed on the settled margin balance at a fixed rate established by management. These loans are collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the clients and, because of collateral coverage ratios, are believed to present minimal collectability exposure. Additionally, these loans are subject to a number of regulatory requirements as well as the Hilltop Broker-Dealers internal policies. The broker-dealer segment s total loans held for investment, net of the allowance for credit losses, were 340.4 million and 344.1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This decrease from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a decrease of 12.7 million, or 6 , in customer margin accounts, partially offset by increases of 4.6 million from non-customer cash accounts and 4.5 million, or 4 , in receivables from correspondents.

 Mortgage Origination Segment The loan portfolio of the mortgage origination segment consists of loans held for sale, primarily single-family residential mortgages funded through PrimeLending, and IRLCs with customers pursuant to which we agree to originate a mortgage loan on a future date at an agreed-upon interest rate. The components of the mortgage origination segment s loans held for sale and IRLCs are as follows (in thousands).

The notional amounts of these forward commitments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 1.0 billion and 1.0 billion, respectively, while the related estimated fair values were 0.9 million and 10.2) million, respectively. Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to the section captioned Critical Accounting Estimates set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K. Loans Held for Investment The Bank has lending policies in place with the goal of establishing an asset portfolio that will provide a return on stockholders equity sufficient to maintain capital to assets ratios that meet or exceed established regulations. Loans are underwritten with careful consideration of the borrower s financial condition, the specific purpose of the loan, the primary sources of repayment and any collateral pledged to secure the loan. As discussed in more detail within the section captioned Financial Condition Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K, the Bank s underwriting procedures address financial components based on the size and complexity of the credit, while the Bank s loan policy provides specific underwriting guidelines by portfolio segment, including commercial and industrial, real estate, construction and land development, and consumer loans. The allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment represents management s best estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our existing portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods. Such future changes in the allowance for credit losses are expected to be volatile given dependence upon, among other things, the portfolio composition and quality, as well as the impact of significant drivers, including prepayment assumptions and macroeconomic conditions and forecasts. Significant judgment is required to estimate the severity and duration of the current economic uncertainties, as well as its potential impact on borrower defaults and loss severity. In particular, macroeconomic conditions and forecasts are rapidly changing and remain highly uncertain. One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating our allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. To determine the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024, we utilized a single macroeconomic alternative scenario, or S5, published by Moody s Analytics in September 2024. During our previous quarterly macroeconomic assessment as of June 30, 2024, we utilized a single macroeconomic alternative scenario, or S7, published by Moody s Analytics in June 2024. Management determined it appropriate to utilize the S5 macroeconomic alternative scenario as of September 30, 2024 given that the

 ongoing resilience of the U.S. economy, continued moderation of inflation, and recent 50-basis point decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve best align with our internal economic outlook. The following table and paragraphs summarize the U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product GDP growth rates and unemployment rate assumptions used in our economic forecast, and based on the single macroeconomic alternative scenario selected for respective period, to determine our best estimate of expected credit losses. 

As of September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023 GDP growth rates: Q3 2023 2.9 Q4 2023 1.1 0.2 Q1 2024 2.4 (1.6) (1.9) Q2 2024 2.1 0.7 (2.4) (3.0) Q3 2024 2.0 1.2 0.4 (1.3) (1.5) Q4 2024 1.3 0.6 0.0 1.3 1.4 Q1 2025 1.2 1.0 (1.8) 2.6 3.1 Q2 2025 1.5 (2.0) (2.8) 3.0 Q3 2025 1.5 (2.5) (1.7) Q4 2025 1.5 (1.3) Q1 2026 1.5 Unemployment rates: Q3 2023 3.8 Q4 2023 3.8 4.1 Q1 2024 3.8 4.8 4.9 Q2 2024 4.0 4.0 5.6 5.7 Q3 2024 4.3 4.1 4.0 6.1 6.0 Q4 2024 4.4 4.1 4.0 5.6 5.7 Q1 2025 4.7 4.1 4.8 5.2 5.3 Q2 2025 4.9 4.8 5.6 5.0 Q3 2025 5.2 5.6 6.0 Q4 2025 5.2 6.0 Q1 2026 5.1 As of September 30, 2024, our U.S. economic forecast assumes elevated borrowing costs reduce credit-sensitive spending, upcoming fiscal disputes in Congress weaken business and consumer sentiment, and concerns grow about broader international conflicts. As a result, the economy underperforms in the long run. The changes in real GDP on an annual average basis are 2.6 in 2024 and 1.5 in 2025. The unemployment rate increases in 2025 and reaches a peak of 5.2 in second half of 2025 before slowly receding. Our forecast considers the potential for monetary policy to ease from the Federal Reserve with the federal funds rate at 4.9 by year end 2024 and 3.8 by year end 2025. Vacancy rates for several commercial real estate sectors remain elevated, and the interest rate outlook challenges the recovery. Since December 31, 2023, we updated our U.S. economic outlook for recent consumer and business spending. Real GDP growth was assumed to contract more modestly (0.0 on an annual average basis and (1.3 peak to trough in 2024. Labor market conditions remained tighter than expected as the unemployment rate decreased to 3.7 in December despite several downward revisions to recent payroll data. We expected monetary policy to remain restrictive at 5.25 to 5.5 in the near term but revert to 3.5 by year end 2025 as the Federal Reserve balances slower economic growth with its inflation and unemployment mandates. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the reversal of credit losses was primarily driven by net charge-offs and loan portfolio changes, including a change in the macroeconomic outlook scenario utilized, associated with collectively evaluated loans, partially offset by a build in the allowance related to specific reserves within the banking segment since the prior quarter. The increase in the provision for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected a build in the allowance related to specific reserves and loan portfolio changes within the banking segment since the prior period, partially offset by the change in the macroeconomic outlook scenario utilized. Specific to the Bank, the net impact to the allowance of changes associated with individually evaluated loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a provision for credit losses of 1.2 million and 13.3 million, respectively, while the net impact to the allowance of changes associated with collectively evaluated loans during the

Table of Contents 
 three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a reversal of credit losses of 2.5 million and 6.5 million, respectively. The changes in the allowance for credit losses during the noted periods were primarily attributable to the Bank and also reflected other factors including, but not limited to, loan mix, and changes in loan balances and qualitative factors from the prior quarter. The changes in the allowance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were also impacted by net charge-offs of 2.9 million and 7.3 million, respectively. As noted above, the combined impacts of specific reserves and loan portfolio changes within the banking segment and changes in the U.S. economic outlook since December 31, 2023 have resulted in a net decrease in the allowance at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. The resulting allowance for credit losses as a percentage of our total loan portfolio, excluding margin loans in the broker-dealer segment and banking segment mortgage warehouse lending programs, was 1.51 and 1.47 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. While changes in the U.S. economic outlook have been reflected in our current allowance at September 30, 2024, uncertainties that include, among others, the uncertain timing, duration and significance of further changes in market interest rates and an uncertain macroeconomic forecast could adversely impact borrower cash flows and result in increases in the allowance during future periods. While all industries could experience adverse impacts, certain of our loan portfolio industry sectors and subsectors, including real estate collateralized by office buildings and auto note financing, have an increased level of risk. The respective distribution of the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of our total loan portfolio, excluding margin loans in the broker-dealer segment and banking segment mortgage warehouse lending programs, are presented in the following table (dollars in thousands). cv

At September 30, 2024, the office, retail and hotel/motel loans held for investment balances of approximately 454 million, 358 million and 196 million, respectively, had an allowance for credit losses of approximately 14 million, 4 million and 3 million, respectively, and an allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment of 3.1 , 1.2 and 1.7 , respectively. (2) Included within commercial real estate owner occupied portfolio are loans within the industrial and office portfolio industry subsectors. At September 30, 2024, the industrial and office loans held for investment balances of approximately 364 million and 315 million, respectively, had an allowance for credit losses of approximately 9 million and 7 million, respectively, and an allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment of 2.4 and 2.2 , respectively. (3) Commercial and industrial portfolio amounts reflect balances excluding banking segment mortgage warehouse lending. Included within commercial and industrial portfolio are loans within the auto note financing industry subsector. At September 30, 2024, the auto note financing loans held for investment balance of approximately 112 million had an allowance for credit losses of approximately 8 million, and an allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment of 7.3 . (4) Included within construction and land development portfolio are loans within the retail and office portfolio industry subsectors. At September 30, 2024, the retail and office loans held for investment balances of approximately 32 million and 25 million, respectively, had an allowance for credit losses of approximately 0.4 million and 0.4 million, respectively, and an allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment of 1.2 and 1.7 , respectively.

 Allowance Model Sensitivity Our allowance model was designed to capture the historical relationship between economic and portfolio changes. As such, evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes or macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because we consider a wide variety of factors and inputs in the allowance for credit losses estimate. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. However, to consider the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to alternative macroeconomic forecasts, we compared the Company s allowance for credit loss estimates as of September 30, 2024, excluding margin loans in the broker-dealer segment, and the banking segment mortgage warehouse programs, with modeled results using both upside S1 and downside S3 economic scenario forecasts published by Moody s Analytics. Compared to our economic forecast, the upside scenario assumes the economic impacts from international armed conflicts recede faster than expected and an increased demand for U.S. exports and manufacturing. Business sentiment and consumer confidence rise significantly. Real GDP is expected to grow 4.1 in the fourth quarter of 2024, 3.7 in the first quarter of 2025, 3.4 in the second quarter of 2025, and 3.5 in the third quarter of 2025. Average unemployment rates are expected to decline to 3.7 by the fourth quarter of 2024 and to 3.1 by the fourth quarter of 2025 before reverting to historical data. Inflation is expected to trend back toward the Federal Reserve s target sooner than expected, and we expect the federal funds rate to peak at 5.3 during 2024. Compared to our economic forecast, the downside scenario assumes the Federal Reserve s efforts to resolve bank failures are not successful at restoring consumer and business confidence, causing banks to tighten lending standards while the Federal Reserve keeps the federal funds rate elevated due to inflation concerns. The international armed conflicts persist longer than anticipated and global supply chain issues worsen causing weaker manufacturing, increased good shortages, and the economy to fall back into recession. Real GDP is expected to decrease 3.4 in the fourth quarter of 2024, 3.5 in the first quarter of 2025, and 3.4 in the second quarter of 2025. Average unemployment rates are expected to increase to 6.0 by the fourth quarter of 2024, and to 8.3 by the fourth quarter of 2025 and then revert back to historical average rates over time. The Federal Reserve reduces the federal funds rate to support the economy to a 4.6 target by the fourth quarter of 2024 and to a 1.0 target by the first quarter of 2026. The impact of applying all of the assumptions of the upside economic scenario during the reasonable and supportable forecast period would have resulted in a decrease in the allowance for credit losses of approximately 22 million or a weighted average expected loss rate of 1.2 as a percentage of our total loan portfolio, excluding margin loans in the broker-dealer segment and the banking segment mortgage warehouse lending programs. The impact of applying all of the assumptions of the downside economic scenario during the reasonable and supportable forecast period would have resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately 52 million or a weighted average expected loss rate of 2.2 as a percentage of our total loan portfolio, excluding margin loans in the broker-dealer segment and the banking segment mortgage warehouse lending programs. This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as they do not reflect any potential changes in the adjustment to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. Our allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses, which is highly dependent on several assumptions, including the macroeconomic outlook, inflationary pressures and labor market conditions, international armed conflicts and their impact on supply chains, the U.S elections and other various fiscal and monetary policy decisions. The sensitivities of many of these assumptions are often correlated and nonlinear so these results should not be simply extrapolated to estimate the allowance for credit losses accurately for more severe changes in economic scenarios. Future allowance for credit losses may vary considerably for these reasons.

Total non-accrual loans classified as loans held for investment increased by 23.4 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to the addition of commercial and industrial loans to non-accrual status, partially offset by a decrease due to the reclassification of a single commercial real estate non-owner occupied loan

 from loans held for investment to loans held for sale, which was sold during the second quarter of 2024, and decreases in commercial real estate owner occupied loans and 1-4 family residential loans. As previously discussed in detail within this section, the allowance for credit losses has fluctuated from period to period, which impacted the resulting ratios noted in the table above. The distribution of the allowance for credit losses among loan types and the percentage of the loans for that type to gross loans, excluding unearned income, within our loan portfolio are presented in the table below (dollars in thousands).

The allowance is based on the estimated exposure at default, multiplied by the lifetime probability of default grade and loss given default grade for that particular loan segment. The Bank estimates expected losses by calculating a commitment usage factor based on industry usage factors. The commitment usage factor is applied over the relevant contractual period. Loss factors from the underlying loans to which commitments are related are applied to the results of the usage calculation to estimate any liability for credit losses related for each loan type. Letters of credit are not currently reserved because they are issued primarily as credit enhancements and the likelihood of funding is low. Changes in the allowance for credit losses for loans with off-balance sheet credit exposures are shown below (in thousands).

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decreases in the reserve for unfunded commitments were primarily due to decreases in commitment balances.

 Potential Problem Loans Potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of an obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of the obligor s potential operating or financial difficulties or whether repayment may depend on collateral or other risk mitigation. Management monitors these loans and reviews their performance on a regular basis. Potential problem loans contain potential weaknesses that could improve, persist or further deteriorate. If such potential weaknesses persist without improving, the loan is subject to downgrade, typically to substandard, in three to six months. Potential problem loans include those loans assigned a grade of special mention and substandard accrual within our risk grading matrix. Potential problem loans do not include purchased credit deteriorated PCD loans because PCD loans exhibited evidence of more than insignificant credit deterioration at acquisition that made it probable that all contractually required principal payments would not be collected. At September 30, 2024, we had 197.9 million of potential problem loans, compared to 207.4 million at December 31, 2023. Our potential problem loans designated as substandard accrual at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, totaled 146.4 million and 204.1 million, respectively. The decrease from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to decreases in commercial and industrial loans and construction and land development loans, partially offset by increases in commercial real estate owner occupied loans and 1-4 family residential loans. Of the 146.4 million of potential problem loans designated as substandard accrual at September 30, 2024, 42.9 million, 41.9 million and 28.3 million were associated with commercial real estate owner occupied loans, commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans and commercial and industrial loans. Potential problem loans designated as special mention were comprised of ten credit relationships totaling 51.5 million at September 30, 2024, compared with three credit relationships totaling 3.2 million at December 31, 2023 . Of the 51.5 million of potential problem loans at September 30, 2024, 44.4 million was associated with four credit relationships included in our commercial real estate non-owner occupied loan portfolio within the office and hotel/motel industry subsectors, commercial and industrial loan portfolio and commercial real estate owner occupied loan portfolio within the retail industry subsector. Non-Performing Assets The following table presents components of our non-performing assets (dollars in thousands).

 At September 30, 2024, non-accrual loans included 25 commercial and industrial relationships with loans secured by finance company notes receivable, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Commercial and industrial non-accrual loans increased by 57.4 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily due to the additions of two credit relationships within our auto note financing industry subsector with an aggregate loan balance of 54.0 million. Non-accrual loans at September 30, 2024 also included 3.4 million of loans secured by residential and commercial real estate which were classified as loans held for sale. At December 31, 2023, non-accrual loans included 40 commercial and industrial relationships with loans secured primarily by notes receivable, accounts receivable and equipment. Non-accrual loans at December 31, 2023 also included 4.0 million of loans secured by residential real estate which were classified as loans held for sale. Other real estate owned OREO decreased from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, primarily due to disposals and valuation adjustments totaling 4.7 million, offset by additions totaling 2.4 million. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, OREO was primarily comprised of commercial properties. Deposits The banking segment s major source of funds and liquidity is its deposit base. Deposits provide funding for its investments in loans and securities. Interest paid for deposits must be managed carefully to control the level of interest expense and overall net interest margin. The composition of the deposit base (time deposits versus interest-bearing demand deposits and savings), as discussed in more detail within the section titled Liquidity and Capital Resources Banking Segment below, is constantly changing due to the banking segment s needs and market conditions. Currently, the banking segment is facing intense competition for its deposit base as customers seek higher yields on deposits. Consistent with the consolidated trend in average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits noted in the table below, the banking segment s average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.94 , compared to 3.92 during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 3.86 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Given the significance of the increases in interest rates that began during the first quarter of 2022 and which remained elevated until the Federal Reserve announced the recent 50-basis point decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate in September 2024, the Bank s cumulative interest-bearing deposit pricing beta, excluding deposits from the Hilltop Securities FDIC-insured sweep program and brokered deposits, has approximated 68 . The deposit pricing beta represents the change in interest-bearing deposit pricing in response to a change in market interest rates. The historical interest-bearing deposit pricing beta for the Bank, excluding deposits from our Hilltop Securities FDIC-insured sweep program and brokered deposits, has approximated 55 . We expect that the Bank s cost related to interest-bearing deposits during 2024 to continue to be driven by various factors, including competition as well as economic and market area factors. The table below presents the average balance of, and rate paid on, consolidated deposits (dollars in thousands). 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Average Average Average Average Balance Rate Paid Balance Rate Paid Noninterest-bearing demand deposits 2,834,140 0.00 3,557,765 0.00 Interest-bearing deposits: Demand 6,244,342 3.55 6,324,203 2.76 Savings 241,405 1.19 289,191 1.05 Time 1,218,096 4.37 1,012,175 2.90 7,703,843 3.61 7,625,569 2.71 Total deposits 10,537,983 2.64 11,183,334 1.85 The table above includes interest-bearing brokered deposits with balances of approximately 15 million at September 30, 2024, compared with approximately 208 million at December 31, 2023. As previously discussed, to bolster our liquidity position given banking sector uncertainties in early 2023, we increased brokered deposits at the Bank by approximately 390 million during the second quarter of 2023, which have subsequently matured during the first and second quarters of 2024. The variability in the level of brokered deposits has been, and will continue to be, managed through asset/liability strategy and policies that address diversification of funding sources and market conditions, including demand by customers and other investors for those deposits, and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time.

 At September 30, 2024, total estimated uninsured deposits were 5.3 billion, or approximately 49 of total deposits, while estimated uninsured deposits, excluding collateralized deposits of 312.3 million, were 5.0 billion, or approximately 46 of total deposits. Total estimated uninsured deposits were 4.7 billion, or approximately 42 of total deposits, as of December 31, 2023. The increase in estimated uninsured deposit balances during 2024 was primarily due to the increase in existing deposit customers balances, while estimated uninsured deposit balances were also impacted by new commercial and consumer depositors of approximately 200 million and 130 million, respectively. The following table presents the scheduled maturities of the portion of our time deposits that are in excess of the FDIC insurance limit of 250,000 as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands). 

Months to maturity: 3 months or less 315,881 3 months to 6 months 116,765 6 months to 12 months 75,023 Over 12 months 102,985 610,654 Borrowings Our consolidated borrowings are shown in the table below (dollars in thousands).

The increase in short-term borrowings at September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, primarily reflected increases in federal funds purchased by the banking segment and commercial paper by the broker dealer segment, offset by a decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase by the broker-dealer segment. Notes payable at September 30, 2024 was comprised of 149.7 million related to the Senior Notes, net of loan origination fees, and Subordinated Notes, net of origination fees, of 197.9 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Hilltop is a financial holding company whose assets primarily consist of the stock of its subsidiaries and invested assets. Hilltop s primary investment objectives, as a holding company, are to support capital deployment for organic growth and to preserve capital to be deployed through acquisitions, dividend payments and stock repurchases. At September 30, 2024, Hilltop had 227.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of 35.5 million from 191.6 million at December 31, 2023. This increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the receipt of 114.3 million of dividends from subsidiaries, partially offset by cash outflows of 33.2 million in cash dividends declared, 19.9 million in stock repurchases and other general corporate expenses. Subject to regulatory restrictions, Hilltop has received, and may also continue to receive, dividends from its subsidiaries. If necessary or appropriate, we may also finance acquisitions with the proceeds from equity or debt issuances. We believe that Hilltop s liquidity is sufficient for the foreseeable future, with current short-term liquidity needs including operating expenses, interest on debt obligations, dividend payments to stockholders and potential stock repurchases. As discussed in more detail below, our Senior Notes mature in April 2025, and we have the ability to redeem the 2030 Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, beginning in May 2025. We continue to evaluate our options, including early redemption of these notes per their respective indentures, and may choose to refinance and/or utilize available cash on hand to satisfy such existing indebtedness. Although it is difficult in the current economic environment to predict the terms and conditions of financing that may be available in the future, we believe that we have sufficient access to credit from financial institutions and/or financing from public and private debt and equity markets to refinance or repay our Senior Notes.

 Economic Environment As previously discussed, operational and financial headwinds during 2023 have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our operating results during 2024. The extent of the impacts of uncertain economic conditions on our financial performance that began in 2022, and have continued into 2024, will depend in part on developments outside of our control, including, among others, the timing and significance of further changes in U.S. Treasury yields and mortgage interest rates, changes in funding costs, inflationary pressures, and international armed conflicts and their impact on supply chains. As demonstrated during both the extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets beginning in March 2020 resulting from the pandemic and banking sector-related uncertainty and concerns associated with liquidity primarily due to high-profile bank failures during early 2023 and their respective negative impacts on the economy, we will continue to monitor the economic environment and evaluate appropriate actions to enhance our financial flexibility, protect capital, minimize losses and ensure target liquidity levels. Dividend Declaration On October 24, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.17 per common share, payable on November 22, 2024 to all common stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 8, 2024. Future dividends on our common stock are subject to the determination by the board of directors based on an evaluation of our earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, the general economic and regulatory climate, our ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to our common stock and other factors. Stock Repurchases In January 2024, our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program through January 2025, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to 75.0 million of our outstanding common stock, inclusive of repurchases to offset dilution related to grants of stock-based compensation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Hilltop paid 19.9 million to repurchase an aggregate of 640,042 shares of our common stock at an average price of 31.04 per share pursuant to the stock repurchase program. Senior Notes due 2025 The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 5 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2015. The Senior Notes will mature on April 15, 2025, unless we redeem the Senior Notes, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, on or after January 15, 2025 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Senior Notes) at our election at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. At September 30, 2024, 150.0 million of our Senior Notes was outstanding. Subordinated Notes due 2030 and 2035 On May 7, 2020, we completed a public offering of 50 million aggregate principal amount of 2030 Subordinated Notes and 150 million aggregate principal amount of 2035 Subordinated Notes that mature on May 15, 2030 and May 15, 2035, respectively. The price to the public for the Subordinated Notes was 100 of the principal amount of the Subordinated Notes. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and fees and expenses of 3.4 million, were 196.6 million. We may redeem the Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, from time to time, subject to obtaining Federal Reserve approval, beginning with the interest payment date of May 15, 2025 for the 2030 Subordinated Notes and beginning with the interest payment date of May 15, 2030 for the 2035 Subordinated Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Subordinated Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. The 2030 Subordinated Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.75 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears commencing on November 15, 2020. The interest rate for the 2030 Subordinated Notes will reset quarterly beginning May 15, 2025 to an interest rate, per year, equal to the then-current benchmark rate, which is expected to be three-month term SOFR rate, plus 5.68 , payable quarterly in arrears. The 2035 Subordinated Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.125 per year,

 payable semi-annually in arrears commencing on November 15, 2020. The interest rate for the 2035 Subordinated Notes will reset quarterly beginning May 15, 2030 to an interest rate, per year, equal to the then-current benchmark rate, which is expected to be three-month term SOFR rate plus 5.80 , payable quarterly in arrears. At September 30, 2024, 200.0 million of our Subordinated Notes was outstanding. Regulatory Capital We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may prompt certain actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Under capital adequacy and regulatory requirements, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. In order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, stock repurchases and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, Basel III requires banking organizations to maintain a capital conservation buffer above minimum risk-based capital requirements measured relative to risk-weighted assets. The following table shows PlainsCapital s and Hilltop s actual capital amounts and ratios in accordance with Basel III compared to the regulatory minimum capital requirements including the conservation buffer ratio in effect at September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands). Based on actual capital amounts and ratios shown in the following table, PlainsCapital s ratios place it in the well capitalized (as defined) capital category under regulatory requirements. Actual capital amounts and ratios as of September 30, 2024 reflect PlainsCapital s and Hilltop s decision to elect the transition option as issued by the federal banking regulatory agencies in March 2020 that permits banking institutions to mitigate the estimated cumulative regulatory capital effects from current expected credit losses over a five-year transitionary period through December 31, 2024.

Banking Segment Within our banking segment, our primary uses of cash are for customer withdrawals and extensions of credit as well as our borrowing costs and other operating expenses. Our corporate treasury group is responsible for continuously monitoring our liquidity position to ensure that our assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet our short-term and long-term cash requirements. Our goal is to manage our liquidity position in a manner such that we can meet our customers short-term and long-term deposit withdrawals and anticipated and unanticipated increases in loan demand without penalizing earnings. Funds invested in short-term marketable instruments, the continuous maturing of other interest-earning assets, cash flows from self-liquidating investments such as mortgage-backed securities and 

 88 

Table of Contents 
 collateralized mortgage obligations, the possible sale of available for sale securities and the ability to securitize certain types of loans provide sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through deposits and the maturity structure of short-term borrowed funds. For short-term liquidity needs, we utilize federal fund lines of credit with correspondent banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, borrowings from the Federal Reserve and borrowings under lines of credit with other financial institutions. For intermediate liquidity needs, we utilize advances from the FHLB. To supply liquidity over the longer term, we have access to brokered time deposits, term loans at the FHLB and borrowings under lines of credit with other financial institutions. The above sources of liquidity allow the banking segment to meet increased liquidity demands without adversely affecting daily operations. The Bank s borrowing capacity through access to secured funding sources is summarized in the following table (in millions). Available liquidity noted below does not include borrowing capacity available through the discount window at the Federal Reserve. 

September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 FHLB capacity 4,374 4,205 Investment portfolio (available) 1,405 1,594 Fed deposits (excess daily requirements) 1,750 1,612 7,529 7,411 As previously discussed, the banking sector experienced increased uncertainty and concerns associated with its liquidity positions primarily due to high-profile bank failures during early 2023 as depositors sought to reduce risks associated with uninsured deposits and withdraw such deposits from existing bank relationships. As a result, both regulatory scrutiny and market focus on liquidity increased. These failures underscore the importance of maintaining access to diverse sources of funding. In light of these events, we have continued our efforts to monitor deposit flows and balance sheet trends to ensure that our liquidity needs are maintained. During 2023, we began increasing interest-bearing deposit rates to address rising market interest rates and intense competition for liquidity to combat deposit outflows. During the first nine months of 2024, our deposit funding costs increased due to intense competition for liquidity and customers seeking higher yields on deposits. While we expect deposit costs during 2024 to continue to be driven by various factors, including competitive pressures and broader economic conditions, with the recent 50-basis point decrease in the target range of the federal funds rate in September 2024 and the possibility of additional rate cuts in 2024, we anticipate that our cost of deposits will begin to trend modestly downward. At September 30, 2024, the Bank also accessed and included approximately 760 million of core deposits on its balance sheet from our Hilltop Securities FDIC-insured sweep program, while the Bank is not utilizing any of its FHLB borrowing capacity noted above through the use of short-term borrowings. Within our banking segment, deposit flows are affected by the level of market interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by competitors, the volatility of equity markets and other factors. An economic recovery and improved commercial real estate investment outlook may result in an outflow of deposits at an accelerated pace as customers utilize such available funds for expanded operations and investment opportunities. The Bank regularly evaluates its deposit products and pricing structures relative to the market to maintain competitiveness over time. Currently, the Bank is facing intense competition from bank and non-bank competitors for its deposit base and expects that its interest expense on certain deposits will continue to be driven by various factors, including competition as well as economic and market area factors. The Bank s 15 largest depositors, excluding Hilltop and Hilltop Securities, collectively accounted for 12.14 of the Bank s total deposits, and the Bank s five largest depositors, excluding Hilltop and Hilltop Securities, collectively accounted for 6.42 of the Bank s total deposits at September 30, 2024. The loss of one or more of our largest Bank customers, or a significant decline in our deposit balances due to ordinary course fluctuations related to these customers businesses, could adversely affect our liquidity and might require us to raise deposit rates to attract new deposits, purchase federal funds or borrow funds on a short-term basis to replace such deposits.

 Broker-Dealer Segment The Hilltop Broker-Dealers rely on their equity capital, short-term bank borrowings, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing client credit balances, correspondent deposits, securities lending arrangements, repurchase agreement financing, commercial paper issuances and other payables to finance their assets and operations, subject to their respective compliance with broker-dealer net capital and customer protection rules. At September 30, 2024, Hilltop Securities had credit arrangements with two unaffiliated banks, with maximum aggregate commitments of up to 425.0 million. These credit arrangements are used to finance securities owned, securities held for correspondent accounts, receivables in customer margin accounts and underwriting activities. These credit arrangements are provided on an as offered basis and are not committed lines of credit. In addition, Hilltop Securities has committed revolving credit facilities with two unaffiliated banks, with aggregate availability of up to 200.0 million. At September 30, 2024, Hilltop Securities had no borrowings under its credit arrangements or under its credit facilities. Hilltop Securities uses the net proceeds (after deducting related issuance expenses) from the sale of two commercial paper programs for general corporate purposes, including working capital and the funding of a portion of its securities inventories. The commercial paper notes CP Notes may be issued with maturities of 14 days to 270 days from the date of issuance. The CP Notes are issued under two separate programs, Series 2019-1 CP Notes and Series 2019-2 CP Notes, in maximum aggregate amounts of 300 million and 200 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average maturity of the CP Notes was 155 days at a rate of 5.80 with a weighted average remaining life of 71 days. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount outstanding under these secured arrangements was 220.6 million, which was collateralized by securities held for Hilltop Securities accounts valued at 241.1 million. Mortgage Origination Segment PrimeLending funds the mortgage loans it originates through a warehouse line of credit maintained with the Bank, which had a total commitment of 1.2 billion, of which 717.7 million was drawn at September 30, 2024. PrimeLending sells substantially all mortgage loans it originates to various investors in the secondary market, historically with the majority with servicing released. As these mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market, PrimeLending pays down its warehouse line of credit with the Bank. In addition, PrimeLending has an available line of credit with an unaffiliated bank of up to 1.0 million, of which no borrowings were drawn at September 30, 2024. PrimeLending owns a 100 membership interest in PrimeLending Ventures Management, LLC Ventures Management ), which holds a controlling ownership interest in and is the managing member of certain ABAs. At September 30, 2024, these ABAs had combined available lines of credit totaling 65.0 million, all of which was with the Bank, with outstanding borrowings of 41.0 million. Other Material Contractual Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Commitments and Guarantees Since December 31, 2023, there have been no material changes in other material contractual obligations disclosed within the section captioned Other Material Contractual Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Commitments and Guarantees set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. Banking Segment We enter into contractual loan commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards until the time of loan funding. We minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. We assess the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and have recorded a liability related to such credit risk in our consolidated financial statements.

 Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third-party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements. In the aggregate, the Bank had outstanding unused commitments to extend credit of 2.0 billion at September 30, 2024 and outstanding financial and performance standby letters of credit of 69.7 million at September 30, 2024. Broker-Dealer Segment The Hilltop Broker-Dealers execute, settle and finance various securities transactions that may expose the Hilltop Broker-Dealers to off-balance sheet risk in the event that a customer or counterparty does not fulfill its contractual obligations. Examples of such transactions include the sale of securities not yet purchased by customers or for the account of the Hilltop Broker-Dealers, use of derivatives to support certain non-profit housing organization clients, clearing agreements between the Hilltop Broker-Dealers and various clearinghouses and broker-dealers, secured financing arrangements that involve pledged securities, and when-issued underwriting and purchase commitments. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices Our consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which presently require us to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars. Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered. The primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Historically, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. However, inflation rose sharply at the end of 2021 and continued to rise in 2023 at levels not seen for over 40 years. Inflationary pressures have moderated in recent periods with the inflation rate coming down from its peak with the expectation that there will be continued moderation of inflation during the remainder of 2024. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation has, and could continue to cause our costs, including compensation, occupancy and software costs, to increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities. Critical Accounting Estimates We have identified certain accounting estimates which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Actual amounts and values as of the balance sheet dates may be materially different than the amounts and values reported due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process. Also, future amounts and values could differ materially from those estimates due to changes in values and circumstances after the balance sheet date. The critical accounting estimates, as summarized below, which we believe to be the most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements relate to allowance for credit losses, mortgage servicing rights asset, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, mortgage loan indemnification liability and acquisition accounting. Since December 31, 2023, there have been no changes in critical accounting estimates as further described under Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our assessment of market risk as of September 30, 2024 indicates there are no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures from those previously reported in our 2023 Form 10-K, except as discussed below. The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may result from changes in value of a financial instrument as a result of changes in interest rates, market prices and the credit perception of an issuer. The disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses, but rather an indicator of reasonably possible losses, and therefore our actual results may differ from any of the following projections. This forward-looking information provides an indicator of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. Banking Segment The banking segment is engaged primarily in the business of investing funds obtained from deposits and borrowings in interest-earning loans and investments, and our primary component of market risk is sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Consequently, our earnings depend to a significant extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on loans and investments and our interest expense on deposits and borrowings. To the extent that our interest-bearing liabilities do not reprice or mature at the same time as our interest-bearing assets, we are subject to interest rate risk and corresponding fluctuations in net interest income. There are several common sources of interest rate risk that must be effectively managed if there is to be minimal impact on our earnings and capital. Repricing risk arises largely from timing differences in the pricing of assets and liabilities. Reinvestment risk refers to the reinvestment of cash flows from interest payments and maturing assets at lower or higher rates. Basis risk exists when different yield curves or pricing indices do not change at precisely the same time or in the same magnitude such that assets and liabilities with the same maturity are not all affected equally. Yield curve risk refers to unequal movements in interest rates across a full range of maturities. We have employed asset/liability management policies that attempt to manage our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, thereby attempting to control the volatility of net interest income, without having to incur unacceptable levels of risk. We employ procedures which include interest rate shock analysis, repricing gap analysis and balance sheet decomposition techniques to help mitigate interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the asset/liability management policies permit the use of various derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk or hedge specified assets and liabilities. To help mitigate net interest income spread volatility between our assets and liabilities, management maintains derivative trades, as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges, that better align repricing characteristics. Any changes in interest rates across the term structure may continue to impact net interest income and net interest margin. The impact of rate movements will change with the shape of the yield curve, including any changes in steepness or flatness and inversions at any points on the yield curve. An interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that, within a defined time period, either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates. The management of interest rate risk is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at specific points in time GAP and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments. Interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income resulting from a movement in interest rates. A company is considered to be asset sensitive, or have a positive GAP, when the amount of its interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest-bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period. Conversely, a company is considered to be liability sensitive, or have a negative GAP, when the amount of its interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest-earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period. During a period of rising interest rates, a negative GAP would tend to affect net interest income adversely, while a positive GAP would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, a negative GAP would tend to result in an increase in net interest income, while a positive GAP would tend to affect net interest income adversely.

 As illustrated in the table below, the banking segment is currently asset sensitive overall. Loans that adjust daily or monthly to the Wall Street Journal Prime rate comprise a large percentage of interest sensitive assets and are the primary cause of the banking segment s asset sensitivity. To help neutralize interest rate sensitivity, the banking segment has kept the terms of most of its borrowings under one year as shown in the following table (dollars in thousands). 

September 30, 2024 3 Months or > 3 Months to > 1 Year to > 3 Years to Less 1 Year 3 Years 5 Years > 5 Years Total Interest sensitive assets: Loans 4,238,159 1,263,344 1,725,246 699,880 504,385 8,431,014 Securities 491,545 204,333 414,966 310,341 878,065 2,299,250 Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 1,918,893 1,918,893 Other interest sensitive assets 8,783 59,504 68,287 Total interest sensitive assets 6,657,380 1,467,677 2,140,212 1,010,221 1,441,954 12,717,444 Interest sensitive liabilities: Interest bearing checking 6,400,270 6,400,270 Savings 224,633 224,633 Time deposits 636,900 461,577 122,335 49,756 1,270,568 Notes payable and other borrowings 495,477 495,477 Total interest sensitive liabilities 7,757,280 461,577 122,335 49,756 8,390,948 Interest sensitivity gap (1,099,900) 1,006,100 2,017,877 960,465 1,441,954 4,326,496 Cumulative interest sensitivity gap (1,099,900) (93,800) 1,924,077 2,884,542 4,326,496 Percentage of cumulative gap to total interest sensitive assets (8.65) (0.74) 15.13 22.68 34.02 The positive GAP in the interest rate analysis indicates that banking segment net interest income would generally rise if rates increase. Because of inherent limitations in interest rate GAP analysis, the banking segment uses multiple interest rate risk measurement techniques. Simulation analysis is used to subject the current repricing conditions to rising and falling interest rates in increments and decrements of 50 to 100 basis points to determine the effect on net interest income changes for the next twelve months. The banking segment also measures the effects of changes in interest rates on economic value of equity by discounting projected cash flows of deposits and loans. Economic value changes in the investment portfolio are estimated by discounting future cash flows and using duration analysis. Investment security prepayments are estimated using current market information. We believe the simulation analysis presents a more accurate picture than the GAP analysis. Simulation analysis recognizes that deposit products may not react to changes in interest rates as quickly or with the same magnitude as earning assets contractually tied to a market rate index. The sensitivity to changes in market rates varies across deposit products. Also, unlike GAP analysis, simulation analysis takes into account the effect of embedded options in the securities and loan portfolios as well as any off-balance sheet derivatives. The table below shows the estimated impact of a range of changes in interest rates on net interest income and on economic value of equity for the banking segment at September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands). 

Change in Changes in Changes in Interest Rates Net Interest Income Economic Value of Equity (basis points) Amount Percent Amount Percent +200 41,508 10.63 212,679 16.49 +100 21,813 5.58 128,357 9.95 -50 (10,649) (2.73) (89,086) (6.91) -100 (21,368) (5.47) (198,272) (15.37) -200 (34,897) (8.93) (424,294) (32.89) The projected changes in the table above were in compliance with established internal policy guidelines, with the exception of the estimated change in economic value of equity impact based on a -200 basis points change in interest rates, which marginally exceeded management s internal policy limit. These projected changes are based on numerous assumptions. Upon implementation of pending assumption updates based on the expected transition into the next interest rate cycle, management anticipates that over time the estimated change in economic value of equity impact will return to compliance with established internal policy limit. Furthermore, the projected changes in net interest income are being impacted by the heightened level of cash balances, which represent a significant portion of the Bank s sensitivity given simulation analysis assumptions/limitations. As a result, the timing and magnitude of future changes in interest rates and any runoff of deposits, and related decline in cash, may impact projected changes in net interest income as noted in the table above. Given projected impacts on net interest income associated with the expected transition into the next phase of

 the interest rate cycle, we continue to evaluate our current GAP position, which may result in a repositioning of the banking segment towards a more neutral or liability sensitive balance sheet. Our portfolio includes loans that periodically reprice or mature prior to the end of an amortized term. Some of our variable-rate loans remain at applicable rate floors, which may delay and/or limit changes in interest income during a period of changing rates. If interest rates were to fall, the impact on our interest income would be limited by these rate floors. In addition, declining interest rates may negatively affect our cost of funds on deposits. The extent of this impact will ultimately be driven by the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate and yield curve movements, as well as changes in market conditions and timing of management strategies. If interest rates were to rise, yields on the portion of our portfolio that remain at applicable rate floors would rise more slowly than increases in market interest rates. Any changes in interest rates across the term structure will continue to impact net interest income and net interest margin. The impact of rate movements will change with the shape of the yield curve, including any changes in steepness or flatness and inversions at any points on the yield curve. Broker-Dealer Segment Our broker-dealer segment is exposed to market risk primarily due to its role as a financial intermediary in customer transactions, which may include purchases and sales of securities, use of derivatives and securities lending activities, and in our trading activities, which are used to support sales, underwriting and other customer activities. We are subject to the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, market prices, investor expectations and changes in credit ratings of the issuer. Our broker-dealer segment is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining inventories of interest rate sensitive financial instruments and other interest-earning assets including customer and correspondent margin loans and receivables and securities borrowing activities. Our funding sources, which include customer and correspondent cash balances, bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and securities lending activities, also expose the broker-dealer to interest rate risk. Movement in short-term interest rates could reduce the positive spread between the broker-dealer segment s interest income and interest expense. With respect to securities held, our interest rate risk is managed by setting and monitoring limits on the size and duration of positions and on the length of time securities can be held. Much of the interest rates on customer and correspondent margin loans and receivables are indexed and can vary daily. Our funding sources are generally short-term with interest rates that can vary daily. The following table categorizes the broker-dealer segment s net trading securities, which are subject to interest rate and market price risk (dollars in thousands).

Our broker-dealer segment is engaged in various brokerage and trading activities that expose us to credit risk arising from potential non-performance from counterparties, customers or issuers of securities. This risk is managed by setting and monitoring position limits for each counterparty, conducting periodic credit reviews of counterparties, reviewing concentrations of securities and conducting business through central clearing organizations. Collateral underlying margin loans to customers and correspondents and with respect to securities lending activities is marked to market daily and additional collateral is required as necessary.

 Mortgage Origination Segment Within our mortgage origination segment, our principal market exposure is to interest rate risk due to the impact on our mortgage-related assets and commitments, including mortgage loans held for sale, IRLCs and MSR. Changes in interest rates could also materially and adversely affect our volume of mortgage loan originations. IRLCs represent an agreement to extend credit to a mortgage loan applicant, whereby the interest rate on the loan is set prior to funding. Our mortgage loans held for sale, which we hold in inventory while awaiting sale into the secondary market, and our IRLCs are subject to the effects of changes in mortgage interest rates from the date of the commitment through the sale of the loan into the secondary market. As a result, we are exposed to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the date of the lock commitment until (i) the lock commitment cancellation or expiration date or (ii) the date of sale into the secondary mortgage market. Loan commitments generally range from 20 to 60 days, and our average holding period of the mortgage loan from funding to sale is approximately 30 days. An integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is our execution of forward commitments to sell MBSs to minimize the impact on earnings resulting from significant fluctuations in the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale and IRLCs caused by changes in interest rates. As a result of our mortgage servicing business, we have a portfolio of retained MSR. One of the principal risks associated with MSR is that in a declining interest rate environment, they will likely lose a substantial portion of their value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments. Moreover, if prepayments are greater than expected, the cash we receive over the life of the mortgage loans would be reduced. The mortgage origination segment uses derivative financial instruments, including U.S. Treasury bond futures and options, and MBS commitments, as a means to mitigate market risk associated with MSR assets. No hedging strategy can protect us completely, and hedging strategies may fail because they are improperly designed, improperly executed and documented or based on inaccurate assumptions and, as a result, could actually increase our risks and losses. The MSR portfolio exposes us to interest rate risk and, correspondingly, the volatility of our earnings, especially if we cannot adequately hedge the interest rate risk relating to our MSR. The goal of our interest rate risk management strategy within our mortgage origination segment is not to eliminate interest rate risk, but to manage it within appropriate limits. To mitigate the risk of loss, we have established policies and procedures, which include guidelines on the amount of exposure to interest rate changes we are willing to accept. Consolidated At September 30, 2024, total debt obligations on our consolidated balance sheet, excluding short-term borrowings and unamortized debt issuance costs and premiums, were 350 million, and was all subject to fixed interest rates. If interest rates were to increase by one eighth of one percent (0.125 ), the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would not have a significant impact on our future consolidated earnings or cash flows. As noted above within the discussion for each business segment, on a consolidated basis, our primary component of market risk is sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Consequently, and in large part due to the significance of our banking segment, our consolidated earnings depend to a significant extent on our net interest income. Refer to the discussion in the Banking Segment section above that provides more details regarding sources of interest rate risk and asset/liability management policies and procedures employed to manage our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and potential future repositioning of our GAP position, thereby attempting to control the volatility of net interest income, without having to incur unacceptable levels of risk. The table below shows the estimated impact of a range of changes in interest rates on net interest income on a consolidated basis at September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands). 

Change in Changes in Interest Rates Net Interest Income (basis points) Amount Percent +200 53,934 12.85 +100 27,972 6.66 -50 (13,695) (3.26) -100 (27,440) (6.54) -200 (51,206) (12.20)

 The projected changes in the table above were in compliance with established internal policy guidelines. These projected changes are based on numerous assumptions of growth and changes in the mix of assets or liabilities. The projected changes in net interest income are being impacted by the heightened level of cash balances, which represent a significant portion of our asset sensitivity given simulation analysis assumptions/limitations. As a result, the timing and magnitude of future changes in interest rates including runoff of deposits, and related decline in cash, may impact projected changes in net interest income as noted in the table above. Item 4. Controls and Procedures . Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the supervision and participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act and are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third fiscal quarter covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
