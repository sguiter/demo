NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (UNAUDITED) 

and 
 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. In addition, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 
on September 30, 2024. Due to its lack of financial resources, the Company has been forced to explore other alternatives, including the
sale of part or all the Property. 

 The
Company has had no operations since it ended its gambling cruise ship operations in 2000. Since that time, the Company has concentrated
its efforts on the development of its Diamondhead, Mississippi property. That development is dependent upon the Company obtaining the
necessary capital, through either equity and/or debt financing, unilaterally or in conjunction with one or more partners, to master plan,
design, obtain permits for, construct, open, and operate a casino resort. 

In
the past, in order to raise capital to continue to pay on-going costs and expenses, the Company has borrowed funds, through Private
Placements of convertible instruments as well as through other secured notes which are more fully described in Notes 5 through 9 to
these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company is in default with respect to payment of both principal and
interest under the terms of most of these instruments. In addition, at September 30, 2024, the Company had 
of accounts payable and accrued expenses and 
in cash and cash equivalents. 

The
above conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

Cooperative
Energy, a Mississippi Electric Cooperative, sought and has now obtained a permanent easement along the northern portion of the Diamondhead
Property on which to construct, maintain and operate electric transmission lines together with an access road. On or about May 24, 2023,
Cooperative Energy filed a Complaint for Eminent Domain in the Special Court of Eminent Domain, Hancock County, Mississippi in which
it named MGC and all persons and entities holding liens on the Diamondhead, Mississippi Property as defendants. 

On
September 1, 2023, Cooperative Energy filed a Motion to Approve Settlement, an Amended Statement of Values and a Notice of Hearing for
September 11, 2023. On September 26, 2023, the Court entered an Order Granting Plaintiff Right of Immediate Title and Possession. On
October 17, 2023, the Court entered an Order Approving Settlement in the amount of and entered an Order Approving Disbursement
of Funds to MGC. On October 20, 2023, MGC received as part of the settlement amount. The parties are working on the wording
of two easements: a Cooperative Energy Right-Of-Way Easement and an Access Road Easement. Once the easements are finalized and signed,
Cooperative Energy will pay MGC the remaining amount due of . Therefore, the Company recorded a receivable of on the
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Management
determined that the easement arrangement was outside the scope of ASC 842. Further, the Company determined that the easement reduced
the value of the property by . The remaining of the million easement was recorded as a gain on the condemnation of
land in the consolidated statements of operations.

is due to a related party. 

of Collateralized Convertible Senior Debentures to accredited or institutional investors. The Offering was conducted contingent
on the deposit into Escrow of the purchase price for all the Debentures offered in the principal amount of . The Debentures,
once issued, originally bore interest at per annum after 180 days, , and were secured by
a lien on the Company s Mississippi property. The interest rate on these debentures was raised pursuant to subsequent agreements.
The debentures were offered in three tranches as follows: 

(a)
 of First Tranche Collateralized Convertible Senior Debentures convertible into an aggregate of shares of Common
Stock of the Company at a conversion price of per share (the First Tranche Debentures 

(b)
 of Second Tranche Collateralized Convertible Senior Debentures, convertible into an aggregate of shares of Common
Stock of the Company at a conversion price of per share (the Second Tranche Debentures and 

(c)
 of Third Tranche Collateralized Convertible Senior Debentures, convertible into either shares of Common Stock or
 shares of Common Stock of the Company, at a conversion price of or per share depending upon certain conditions described
in the Private Placement Memorandum (the Third Tranche Debentures ). 

The
conversion rights on each issued Debenture carried an Anti-Dilution Provision. If the Company issued any shares of Common Stock or other
securities after March 31, 2014 at a price per security that was less than the conversion price of a Debenture, then the Debenture would
have had a new conversion price equal to the price per security that was less than the Conversion Price of the Debenture. The foregoing
provision did not apply to the following: 

(a)
The issuance of any of the other Debentures in the Offering or the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of any of the Debentures
in the Offering. 

(b)
The issuance of any shares of Common Stock if such issuance relates to an agreement, arrangement or grant to issue shares of Common Stock
entered into by the Company prior to the Issue Date of the First Tranche Debentures in the Offering, including but not limited to, for
example, previously issued convertible promissory notes, previously issued warrants, previously issued options to purchase Common Stock,
or common stock vested or to be issued pursuant to a pre-existing Employee Stock Ownership Plan. 

The
Anti-Dilution Provisions with respect to a Debenture terminate the earlier of (a) the date (if ever) the Company receives an Approval
to Proceed from the Mississippi Gaming Commission to develop a casino/hotel on the Property, (b) the date on which the Debenture
is converted in full, (c) the date on which the Debenture is paid in full, or (d) the Final Maturity Date of the Debenture (as defined
in the Debenture). 

Since
the issuance of the Debentures, there have been no events that would trigger the above anti-dilution provisions. 

When
originally issued, in the event the Company failed to meet the conditions for conversion of the Debentures, the First Tranche Convertible
Debentures, which total , would have been and the Second Tranche Convertible Debentures, which total ,
would have been . The sole remaining non-convertible Debenture in the amount of would have been . However, the Company is in default with respect to interest payments due under the Debenture agreements in the amount of 
and as a result, the Debentures payable are reported as current liabilities.

million of principal due under their Debentures. Total accrued interest due on all outstanding Debentures amounted to and 
at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively.

was due . On July 20, 2023, the Noteholder agreed to extend the maturity date of the note to June 9, 2025 with the understanding
that the note would be paid in full from the proceeds of an expected eminent domain settlement. Mississippi Gaming Corporation, a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company, guaranteed the Note. In addition, the President of the Company agreed to personally guarantee the Note
and to personally secure the Note with an assignment of proceeds due to her under the first lien on the Diamondhead property. The interest

expenses required to file the Company s Form 10-Q. On August 25, 2016, the Company issued a Note to the foregoing lenders, which
matures from the date of issuance and bears interest at per annum, with a full year of interest accruing in any year in
which the advance remains unpaid. Accrued interest due on the above notes amounted to and at September 30, 2024

our view, there can be no assurance, although no assurance can be given, or there is no way
to anticipate with certainty. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our ability to implement our
business plan and business strategy, our ability to obtain financing to sustain the Company, our ability to finance any future development,
construction or operations, our ability to attract key personnel, and our ability to operate profitably in the future. These forward-looking

The
Company s intent was and is to construct a casino resort and other amenities on the Property unilaterally or in conjunction with
one or more joint venture partners. However, the Company has been unable, to date, to obtain financing to move the project forward and/or
enter into a joint venture partnership. There can be no assurance that the substantial funds required for the design and construction
of the project can be obtained or that such funds can be obtained on acceptable terms. In addition, the Company has been unable to obtain
financing to sustain the Company. Due to its lack of financial resources, the Company was forced to explore other alternatives, including
a sale of part or all of the Property. The Company s preference is to sell only part of the Property inasmuch as this would appear
to be in the best interest of the stockholders of the Company. However, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to sell only
part of the Property. The Company intends to continue to pursue a joint venture partnership and/or other financing while seeking a viable
purchaser for part or all of the Property. Finally, there can be no assurance that if the requisite financing for the project were obtained
and the project were constructed, that the project would be successful.

unilaterally, or in conjunction with one or more partners, to master plan, design, obtain permits for, construct, staff, open, and
operate a casino resort. In the past, the Company has been able to sustain itself through various short-term borrowings. At
September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 219,864, while accounts
payable and accrued expenses totaled 14,717,157 and the Company had an accumulated deficit of 48,275,002. The Company is expecting
an additional 154,622 of income from its eminent domain settlement. The Company reported a net loss applicable to common
shareholders of 1,336,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. While the Company currently has sufficient funds to sustain
itself, it is imperative that the Company secure a source of funds to provide further working capital. 

Management
of the Company believes it will be difficult to secure suitable financing that would allow it to continue to pursue ultimate development
of the Property. Therefore, on December 14, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with an unrelated commercial real estate brokerage
firm to sell all or part of the Diamondhead, Mississippi Property or to find an equity investor for the project and/or financing for
the project. The agreement became effective December 14, 2023, and terminates December 31, 2025, unless extended in writing by the parties.
The agreement is a non-exclusive agreement and provides for a success-based fee only. 

The
above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern and its ability to generate
cash to meet its cash requirements for the following twelve months as of the date of this Form 10-Q. 

Financial
Results and Analysis 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred net losses applicable to common stockholders of 1,412,200 and
 1,326,975, respectively. The increase in the loss, which totaled 85,225, is primarily due to an increase in interest expense during
the first three quarters of 2024. 

Administrative
and general expenses incurred totaled 633,251 and 589,744 for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The

2023 to 2024.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

Management
Agreement 

On
June 19, 1993, two subsidiaries of the Company, Casino World Inc. and Mississippi Gaming Corporation, entered into a Management Agreement
with Casinos Austria Maritime Corporation (CAMC). Subject to certain conditions, under the Management Agreement, CAMC would operate on
an exclusive basis, all of the Company s proposed dockside gaming casinos in the State of Mississippi, including any operation
fifty percent (50 or more of which is owned by the Company or its affiliates. Unless terminated earlier pursuant to the provisions
of the Agreement, the Agreement terminates five years from the first day of actual Mississippi gaming operations and provides for the
payment of an annual operational term management fee of 1.2 of all gross gaming revenues between zero and 100,000,000; plus 0.75 of
gross gaming revenue between 100,000,000 and 140,000,000; plus 0.5 of gross gaming revenue above 140,000,000; plus two percent of
the net gaming revenue between zero and 25,000,000; plus three percent of the net gaming revenue above twenty-five million dollars 25,000,000.
The Company believes this Agreement is no longer in effect. However, there can be no assurance that CAMC will not attempt to maintain
otherwise which would lead to litigation. 

Brokerage
Agreement 

On
December 14, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with an unrelated commercial real estate brokerage firm to sell all or part
of Diamondhead, Mississippi Property or to find an equity investor for the project and/or financing for the project. The agreement became
effective December 14, 2023 and terminates December 31, 2025, unless extended in writing by the parties. The agreement is a non-exclusive
agreement and provides for a success-based fee only. 

In
the event of a sale of all or part of the Diamondhead Property to the person(s) or entity(ies) the broker brings to the deal, the Company
will pay a fee equal to four percent (4 of the gross sales price of property sold to the person(s) or entity(ies) the broker brings
to the deal. 

In
the event of an equity investment by an equity investor(s) the broker brings to the deal, the Company will pay the broker a fee equal
to: (i) four percent (4 of the amount of the equity invested on the first 25 million invested, plus (ii) 2 of the amount of the equity
invested in excess of 25 million. In the event the broker closes an equity financing, the broker shall have a right of first refusal
to obtain debt financing for a period of two years commencing with the final date on which the Company receives the equity financing
during the term of the agreement or post-termination of the agreement. 

In
the event the broker secures debt financing for the Company, the Company will pay the broker: (i) one percent (1 of the amount of any
debt financing obtained from the person(s) or entity(ies) the broker brings to the deal on the first 75 million received by the Company,
plus (ii) one-half of one percent (.50 of the amount of any debt financing obtained in excess of the first 75 million received from
a person(s) or entity(ies) the broker brings to the deal. 

All
fees are contingent. Payment of any fee is contingent on the signing of a sales agreement, equity agreement, or loan agreement acceptable
to the Company in its sole discretion and payment of the sales price, equity investment or debt financing by the person(s) or entity(ies)
the broker brings to the deal and upon receipt of good funds. All fees will be paid at Closing out of monies paid by the person(s) or
entity(ies) the broker brings to the deal. If funds are paid periodically, the fee due will be paid periodically upon receipt of said
funds and in proportion to the funds received. 

There
are no other off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources,
that are material to our stockholders. 

Related
Party 

In
July 2017, the Chairman of the Board paid 67,628 for all property taxes due, together with all interest due thereon, to Hancock County,
Mississippi for the approximate 400-acre tract of land the Diamondhead Property ), owned by Mississippi Gaming Corporation,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In 2018, the Chairman advanced additional funds totaling 205,250 to the Company. In 2019,
the Chairman advanced additional funds totaling 125,396 to the Company. In 2020, the Chairman advanced additional funds totaling 69,679
to the Company. The conditions of the notes under which the Chairman agreed to make the foregoing payments and advances are discussed
in full detail in Note 8 of the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Of
particular note to these conditions is item (v) which called for the Chairman to be indemnified for any loss sustained on the sale of
certain common stock sold to cover the property taxes paid. The Chairman identified the common stock sold and provided the Company with
the documentation required to document the sale of said stock and to calculate the contingent future loss, if any, on said stock. Had
the Company paid the note in full at December 31, 2021 in addition to the principal and interest due, the Company would not have been
liable for any additional funds to indemnify the Chairman pursuant to the terms of the notes. On
February 4, 2022, the Board of Directors entered into an agreement with the Chairman to issue 35,000 shares of common stock of the Company
to the Chairman to repurchase the indemnification. This repurchase eliminated any risk to the Company arising from the indemnification
which could have been material. 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded stock-based compensation of 397 and 0 for the fair value for these
shares, which have not been issued as of the issuance date of these financial statements. 

There
are no other off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources,
that are material to our stockholders. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

The
Company reviews long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted
future cash flows projected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of such assets determined by appraisal, discounted cash flow projections,
or other means.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

In
connection with the preparation of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer, who also serves as Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act, are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that the information that we are required to disclose
in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s Rules and Forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on
the results of this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as September 30, 2024. See below for management s report. 

The
management, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with existing policies or procedures
may deteriorate. 

The
Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer conducted, under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in
Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission,
commonly referred to as the COSO criteria. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial
Officer concluded that material weaknesses over financial reporting existed as of September 30, 2024. Management identified the
following material weakness that has caused management to conclude that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and
procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, were not effective at the reasonable assurance level: 

1. 
 We
 do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions inasmuch as we have only one employee. 

The
Company has designed and instituted policies and procedures to eliminate and/or mitigate the foregoing. 

As
a result of the material weakness identified above, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September
30, 2024. The Company has initiated a plan to address the above weakness. While segregation of duties is very difficult in a small company
with only one employee, the Company intends to utilize third-party consultants to ensure effective financial reporting and disclosures
are met. 

To
address the material weakness identified, management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the consolidated
financial statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash
flows for the periods presented. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all
material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During the third quarter ending
September 30, 2024, Management has taken corrective actions to address the previously reported material weakness related to the development
and communication of accounting policies and procedures. The company has established and effectively communicated accounting policies
and procedures, resulting in consistent practices for complex accounting transactions. Based on our examination of evidence supporting
management s assertion and other procedures performed, we believe that the previously reported material weakness no longer exists.
