Increased competitive pressures, both domestically and internationally; 

Legal and regulatory developments, such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities; 

The imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions and changes in international tax laws or currency controls;

Overview 

Reflect Scientific is engaged in the manufacture and
distribution of innovative products targeted at the life science market. Our customers include hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, pharmaceutical
and biotech companies, cold chain management, universities, government and private sector research facilities, chemical and industrial
companies. 

Our goal is to provide our customers with the best
solution for their needs. This philosophy extends into our business strategies and acquisition plans. Through a series of strategic acquisitions,
we acquired technology that has enabled us to expand our line of products to align with, and capitalize on, market needs. Our growing
product portfolio includes ultra-low temperature freezers, blast freezers, solvent chillers and refrigerated transportation in addition
to supplying OEM products to the life sciences industry. 

Our Cryometrix brand ultra-low temperature and blast
freezers innovative design enables our customers to save substantially on energy costs related to cryogenic storage. Ultra-low temperature
freezers are used worldwide for the storage of vaccines, DNA, RNA, proteins and many other biological and chemical substances. There is
a growing need for energy efficient, reliable ultra-low temperature storage units. Our Cryometrix freezers are targeted to this growing
market and we have had tremendous success in blood storage and pharmaceutical manufacturing applications. The application of this technology
for use in refrigerated trailers (commonly called reefers used to transport goods which need to be maintained in a cold
environment significantly broadens the market for this technology. The utilization of this technology in reefers eliminates the current
method of cooling, which uses engines run on hydrocarbon fuels. The Cryometrix technology is pollutant free and is more efficient and
cost effective than the technologies currently used. Reflect Scientific has added a new product line of solvent chillers. Solvent chillers
are used in natural products extraction for optimizing product yield and purity. 

Recent Developments 

None. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates. These
estimates are based on management s historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

For a description of the accounting policies that,
in management s opinion, involve the most significant application of judgment or involve complex estimation and which could, if
different judgment or estimates were made, materially affect our reported financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, see
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. 

During the three months and nine months ended September
30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our accounting policies and estimates.

Revenues . Revenues decreased by 11,851,
or -2.3 , to 514,023 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 525,874 for the three months ended September 30,
2023. Revenues were consistent between years due to freezer and chiller sales driven by customer needs. 

Cost of goods sold . Cost of goods sold
decreased by 9,691, or -4.9 , to 186,197 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 195,888 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. Decrease was primarily due to slightly lower revenues for the same time period. 

Gross profit . Our gross profit as a
percentage of sales increased to 63.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 62.8 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to the margins in freezer and chiller sales during the current period. 

Salaries and wages . Salaries and wages
decreased by 17,334, or -11.4 , to 137,943 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 155,677 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. Decrease was primarily due reduction of hours during the current period and decreased employee headcount. 

General and administrative .
General and administrative expenses increased by 3,221 or 3.8 , to 87,552 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as
compared to 84,331 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Increase was primarily due to increased advertising and marketing
during the current period. 

Research and development . Research and
development expenses decreased by 5,990, or -66.0 , to 3,092 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 9,082 for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. Such decrease was primarily a result of resource allocation to marketing and production. 

14 

Other income . Other income was 10,791
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5,368 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is from
interest income earned on business money market savings accounts. These were opened during the third quarter of 2023. 

Net income . As a result of the
cumulative effect of the factors described above, our net income was 109,930 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as
compared to a net income of 86,264 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Management continues to look for opportunities to
increase sales, improve gross margins and control ongoing operating expenses.

30, 2024 and 2023

results of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, both in dollars and as a percentage of our revenues.

or 72.0 , to 1,532,849 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 891,385 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Such
increase was primarily due to a significant increase in freezer and chiller sales throughout the year. 

Cost of goods sold . Cost of goods
sold increased by 231,306 or 62.0 , to 604,677 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 373,371 for the nine months

percentage of sales increased to 60.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 58.1 for the nine months ended June
30, 2023. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to the increase in freezer and chiller sales, which have higher margins
than other products. 

Salaries and wages . Salaries and wages
decreased by 43,910, or -9.3 , to 428,611 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 472,521 for the nine months ended September

development expenses decreased by 5,456, or -26.6 , to 15,072 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 20,528 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. Such decrease was primarily a result of a shift in company priorities. 

Other income . Other income was
 29,968 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5,368 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase
is from interest income earned on business money market savings accounts. These were opened during the third quarter of 2023. 

Net income (loss) . As a result of the
cumulative effect of the factors described above, our net income was 186,946 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to net loss of 242,663 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Management has looked for opportunities to increase sales, improve
gross margins and control ongoing operating expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
our current assets exceeded current liabilities by 1,954,096 and 1,773,784, respectively, and we had cash and cash equivalents of
 1,030,408 and 1,277,951, respectively. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through revenue generated from
operations, cash proceeds from financing activities, borrowings, and equity contributions by our shareholders.

Net cash used in operating activities was 247,543
and used in operating activities 42,481 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Significant factors affecting
operating cash flows were primarily a result of increased accounts receivable during the current period. 

We continue working to enhance our on-line ordering
system to increase sales, develop the market for our ultra-low temperature freezers, work with current vendors to obtain more favorable
pricing, and locate new vendors to provide opportunities to further reduce our cost of goods. 

We will continue to focus our efforts on our core
business activities while pursuing capital resources and evaluating potential future acquisitions which fit within and enhance our core
business. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Disclosure controls
and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief
executive officer and chief principal officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As required by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act,
our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of our chief executive officer and principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024.
Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, our chief executive officer and principal financial officer determined that there have
been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 to the material weaknesses described in Item
9A Controls and Procedures of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective. 

PART II

any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating
results.
