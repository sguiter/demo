million, which was expensed as research and development (R D) in the second quarter of 2024. In connection with the successful completion of the Phase 2 clinical study for NBI-1117568 in August 2024, we paid Nxera a milestone of million, which was expensed as R D in the third quarter of 2024. We expect to advance NBI-1117568 into Phase 3 development in the first half of 2025, which would trigger a milestone of million payable to Nxera upon initiation of the Phase 3 clinical study. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, Nxera may be entitled to receive potential future payments of up to billion upon the achievement of certain event-based milestones and would be entitled to receive royalties on the future net sales of any collaboration product. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the date on which the royalty term for such licensed product has expired in such country. On a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, royalty payments would commence on the first commercial sale of a licensed product and terminate on the later of (i) the expiration of the last patent covering such licensed product in such country, (ii) a number of years from the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country and (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such licensed product in such country. 
 We may terminate the agreement in its entirety or with respect to one or more targets upon days written notice to Nxera during the research collaboration term and upon days written notice to Nxera following the expiration of the research collaboration term. Following the expiration of the research collaboration term, Nxera may terminate the agreement on a target-by-target basis in the event that we do not conduct any material development activities outside of Japan with respect to a certain compound or licensed product within the applicable target class for a continuous period of not less than days and do not commence any such activities within days of receiving written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement, subject to specified conditions, (i) in the event of material breach by the other party, subject to a cure period, (ii) if the other party challenges the validity or enforceability of certain intellectual property rights, subject to a cure period, or (iii) if the other party becomes insolvent or takes certain actions related to insolvency. 
 Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda. In 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda, pursuant to which we acquired the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize certain early to mid-stage psychiatry compounds, including luvadaxistat, NBI-1070770, NBI-1065845, NBI-1065846 and non-clinical stage compounds. In the third quarter of 2024, we provided Takeda with written notice of termination of the license agreement to develop and commercialize luvadaxistat and NBI-1065846. The termination is anticipated to be effective in April 2025. 
 NBI-1070770 and the non-clinical stage compounds have each been designated as a royalty-bearing product. We are responsible for all manufacturing, development and commercialization costs of any royalty-bearing product. 
 NBI-1065845 is currently designated as a profit-share product, meaning we and Takeda will equally share in the operating profits and losses. Takeda retains the right to opt-out of the profit-sharing arrangement, pursuant to which Takeda would be entitled to receive potential future payments upon the achievement of certain event-based milestones with respect to NBI-1065845 and receive royalties on the future net sales of NBI-1065845 (in lieu of equally sharing in the operating profits and losses). Takeda may elect to exercise the opt-out right for NBI-1065845 immediately following the completion of a second Phase 2 clinical study for NBI-1065845, or, under certain circumstances related to the development and commercialization activities to be performed by us, before the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical study for NBI-1065845. 
 In connection with the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical study for NBI-1070770 as a potential treatment for major depressive disorder in April 2024, we paid Takeda a milestone of million, which was expensed as R D in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, Takeda may be entitled to receive potential future payments of up to billion upon the achievement of certain event-based milestones and would be entitled to receive royalties on the future net sales of any royalty-bearing product. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the date on which, (i) for any royalty-bearing product, the royalty term has expired in such country; and (ii) for any profit-share product, for so long as we continue to develop, manufacture, or commercialize such licensed product. On a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, royalty payments would commence on the first commercial sale of a royalty-bearing product and terminate on the later of (i) the expiration of the last patent covering such royalty-bearing product in such country, (ii) a number of years from the first commercial sale of such royalty-bearing product in such country and (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such royalty-bearing product in such country.

written notice to Takeda (i) with respect to all licensed products prior to the first commercial sale of the first licensed product for which first commercial sale occurs, or (ii) with respect to all licensed products in one or more given target classes, as defined in the agreement, prior to the first commercial sale of the first licensed product in such target class for which first commercial sale occurs. We may terminate the agreement in its entirety or in one or more (but not all) of the major markets upon months written notice to Takeda (i) with respect to all licensed products following the first commercial sale of the first licensed product for which first commercial sale occurs, or (ii) with respect to all licensed products in one or more given target classes following the first commercial sale of the first licensed product in such target class for which first commercial sale occurs. Takeda may terminate the agreement, subject to specified conditions, (i) if we challenge the validity or enforceability of certain Takeda intellectual property rights or (ii) on a target class-by-target class basis, in the event that we do not conduct any material development or commercialization activities with respect to any licensed product within such target class for a specified continuous period. Subject to a cure period, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of any material breach, solely with respect to the target class of a licensed product to which such material breach relates, or in its entirety in the event of any material breach that relates to all licensed products. 
 Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd., or Idorsia. In 2020, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Idorsia, pursuant to which we acquired the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize NBI-827104, a potent, selective, orally active and brain penetrating T-type calcium channel blocker in clinical development for the treatment of a rare pediatric epilepsy and other potential indications, including essential tremor. We are responsible for all manufacturing, development and commercialization costs of any collaboration product. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we provided Idorsia with written notice of termination of the license agreement to develop and commercialize NBI-827104. The termination is anticipated to be effective in January 2025. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, Idorsia may be entitled to receive potential future payments of up to billion upon the achievement of certain event-based milestones and would be entitled to receive royalties on the future net sales of any collaboration product. 
 We may terminate the agreement, in its entirety or with respect to a particular compound or development candidate, upon days written notice to Idorsia. Further, in the event a party commits a material breach and fails to cure such material breach within days after receiving written notice thereof, the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement in its entirety immediately upon written notice to the breaching party. 
 Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Xenon. In 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Xenon to identify, research and develop sodium channel inhibitors, including NBI-921352 and preclinical candidates, which compounds we have the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize. We are responsible for all development and manufacturing costs of any collaboration product, subject to certain exceptions. 
 In connection with entering the agreement in 2019, we purchased approximately million shares (at per share) of Xenon common stock (the 2019 Xenon Shares). The 2019 Xenon Shares were recorded at a fair value of million after considering Xenon s stock price and certain transfer restrictions that were applicable to the shares on the measurement date. 
 In connection with the achievement of a development milestone in 2021, we purchased approximately million shares (at per share) of Xenon common stock (the 2021 Xenon Shares). The 2021 Xenon Shares were recorded at a fair value of million after considering Xenon s stock price and certain transfer restrictions that were applicable to the shares on the measurement date. 
 In connection with the achievement of a development milestone in 2022, we purchased approximately million shares (at per share) of Xenon common stock (the 2022 Xenon Shares). The 2022 Xenon Shares were recorded at a fair value of million after considering Xenon s stock price on the measurement date. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, Xenon may be entitled to receive potential future payments of up to billion upon the achievement of certain event-based milestones and would be entitled to receive royalties on the future net sales of any collaboration product. Xenon retains the right to elect to co-develop one product in a major indication, pursuant to which Xenon would receive a mid-single digit percentage increase in royalties earned on the future net sales of such product in the United States and we and Xenon would equally share in the development costs of such product in the applicable indication, except where such development costs relate solely to the regulatory approval of such product outside the United States. 
 
 9 

days written notice to Xenon, provided that such unilateral termination will not be effective for certain products until we have used commercially reasonable efforts to complete certain specified clinical studies. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions. 
 Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., or Voyager. 
 2019 Voyager Agreement. In 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Voyager (the 2019 Voyager Agreement), pursuant to which we retain certain rights to develop and commercialize the Friedreich s ataxia (FA) program and undisclosed programs. We are responsible for all development and commercialization costs of any collaboration product under the 2019 Voyager Agreement, subject to certain co-development and co-commercialization rights retained by Voyager. 
 In connection with the 2019 Voyager Agreement, we purchased approximately million shares (at per share) of Voyager common stock (the 2019 Voyager Shares), which are subject to certain transfer, beneficial ownership, and voting restrictions for a period of up to from the effective date of the 2023 Voyager Agreement (defined below). The 2019 Voyager Shares were recorded at a fair value of million after considering Voyager s stock price and certain transfer restrictions that were applicable to the shares on the measurement date. 
 In connection with the selection of a development candidate under the FA program pursuant to our collaboration with Voyager, we expensed a milestone of million as R D in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Under the terms of the 2019 Voyager Agreement, Voyager may be entitled to receive potential future payments of up to billion upon the achievement of certain event-based milestones and would be entitled to receive royalties on the future net sales of any collaboration product, subject to certain co-development and co-commercialization rights retained by Voyager. 
 Unless terminated earlier, the 2019 Voyager Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the last to expire royalty term with respect to any collaboration product under the agreement or the last expiration or termination of any exercised co-development and co-commercialization rights by Voyager as provided for in the 2019 Voyager Agreement. We may terminate the 2019 Voyager Agreement upon days written notice to Voyager prior to the first commercial sale of any collaboration product under the 2019 Voyager Agreement or upon after the date of notice if such notice is provided after the first commercial sale of any collaboration product under the 2019 Voyager Agreement. 
 2023 Voyager Agreement. In 2023, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Voyager (the 2023 Voyager Agreement), pursuant to which we acquired the global rights to the gene therapy products directed to the gene that encodes glucosylceramidase beta 1 (GBA1) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and other diseases associated with GBA1 (the GBA1 Program), and gene therapy programs directed to rare central nervous system (CNS) targets, each enabled by Voyager's next-generation TRACER TM capsids. With respect to collaboration products subject to the GBA1 Program, we are responsible for all development and commercialization costs of any such products, including in the U.S., where Voyager retains certain co-development and co-commercialization rights. Voyager may elect to exercise such rights, pursuant to which we and Voyager would equally share in the operating profits and losses of such products in the U.S. (in lieu of Voyager being entitled to receive potential future payments of certain event-based milestones upon their achievement in the U.S. and receive royalties on the future net sales of such products in the U.S.), following Voyager s receipt of the top-line data from a first clinical trial Parkinson s disease. However, if we and Voyager elect to focus on an indication other than Parkinson s disease prior to Voyager s receipt of top-line data from a first clinical trial for Parkinson s disease, then Voyager may elect to exercise such co-development and co-commercialization rights after the later of: (i) Voyager s receipt of top-line data from the first clinical trial of a product that is the subject of the GBA1 Program or (ii) the date we and Voyager decide not to pursue Parkinson s disease as an indication for development under the GBA1 Program. Irrespective of Voyager s election to exercise such rights, Voyager may be entitled to receive potential future payments upon the achievement of certain event-based milestones outside the U.S. and would be entitled to receive royalties on the future net sales of any such product outside the U.S. With respect to collaboration products subject to the gene therapy programs directed to rare CNS targets, we are responsible for all development and commercialization costs for any such products. 
 
 10 

million upfront, including a purchase of approximately million shares (at per share) of Voyager common stock (the 2023 Voyager Shares), which are subject to certain transfer, beneficial ownership, and voting restrictions for a period of up to from the effective date of the 2023 Voyager Agreement. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition as the set of acquired assets did not constitute a business. In addition, as part of the collaboration, Jude Onyia, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Neurocrine Biosciences, was appointed to Voyager's board of directors. Dr. Onyia (or another individual designated by us) will be nominated for election to Voyager's board of directors annually for a maximum duration of years from the effective date of the 2023 Voyager Agreement. As a result, our equity investment in Voyager became subject to the equity method of accounting, and Voyager became a related party, following our purchase of the 2023 Voyager Shares, after which, together with the 2019 Voyager Shares, we owned approximately of the voting stock of Voyager. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Voyager as we believe it creates greater transparency regarding the investment's fair value at future reporting dates. The 2023 Voyager Shares were recorded at a fair value of million after considering Voyager s stock price on the measurement date. The remaining million of the purchase price, which includes certain transaction-related costs, was expensed as in-process research and development in the first quarter of 2023 as the license had no foreseeable alternative future use. 
 In connection with the selection of development candidates under the GBA1 program pursuant to our collaboration with Voyager, we expensed milestones of million as R D in both the second and third quarters of 2024. 
 Under the terms of the 2023 Voyager Agreement, Voyager may be entitled to receive potential future payments of up to billion upon the achievement of certain event-based milestones and would be entitled to receive royalties on the future net sales of any collaboration product, subject to certain co-development and co-commercialization rights retained by Voyager. 
 Unless terminated earlier, the 2023 Voyager Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the last to expire royalty term with respect to any collaboration product under the 2023 Voyager Agreement or the last expiration or termination of any exercised co-development and co-commercialization rights by Voyager as provided for in the 2023 Voyager Agreement. We may terminate the 2023 Voyager Agreement upon days written notice to Voyager prior to the first commercial sale of any collaboration product under the 2023 Voyager Agreement or upon after the date of notice if such notice is provided after the first commercial sale of any collaboration product under the 2023 Voyager Agreement. 
 Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, or MTPC. In 2015, we out-licensed the rights to valbenazine in Japan and other select Asian markets to MTPC. In 2020, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with MTPC, pursuant to which we supply MTPC with valbenazine drug product for commercial use in such markets. MTPC is responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization costs of valbenazine in such markets. 
 MTPC launched DYSVAL (valbenazine) in Japan for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in June 2022 and subsequently in other select Asian markets, where it is marketed as REMLEAS (valbenazine). We receive royalties at tiered percentage rates on MTPC net sales of valbenazine. 
 Under the terms of our license agreement with MTPC, we may be entitled to receive potential future payments of up to million upon the achievement of certain sales-based milestones and are entitled to receive royalties at tiered percentage rates on future MTPC net sales of valbenazine for the longer of years or the life of the related patent rights. MTPC may terminate the agreement upon days written notice to us. In such event, all out-licensed product rights would revert to us. 
 AbbVie Inc., or AbbVie. In 2010, we out-licensed the global rights to elagolix to AbbVie. AbbVie is responsible for all development and commercialization costs of elagolix. 
 AbbVie launched ORILISSA (elagolix tablets) in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in August 2018 and ORIAHNN (elagolix, estradiol and norethindrone acetate capsules and elagolix capsules) in the U.S. for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids in June 2020. We receive royalties at tiered percentage rates on AbbVie net sales of elagolix and recognized elagolix royalty revenue of million and million, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 and million and million, respectively, for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. 
 Under the terms of our license agreement with AbbVie, we may be entitled to receive potential future payments of up to million upon the achievement of certain event-based milestones and are entitled to receive royalties at tiered percentage rates on future AbbVie net sales of elagolix for the longer of years or the life of the related patent rights. AbbVie may terminate the agreement upon days written notice to us. In such event, all out-licensed product rights would revert to us.

 (1) Amounts presented in the table above exclude million for 2025, million for 2026, million for 2027, million for 2028 and million thereafter of approximate non-cancelable future minimum lease payments under an operating lease related to our new campus facility that has not yet commenced. 
 New Campus Facility. On February 8, 2022, we entered into a lease agreement for a four-building campus facility currently under construction in San Diego, California, including a option for the construction of a fifth building. This campus facility, comprised of office space and research and development laboratories, now serves as our corporate headquarters. 
 The construction of the campus facility is phased. The first phase of construction, consisting of buildings relating to office space, was completed in December 2023 and resulted in the recognition of ROU assets and operating lease liabilities totaling million and million, respectively. The second phase of construction, consisting of buildings relating to laboratory space, is scheduled for completion by the end of 2024. 
 As we continue to occupy our new campus facility, certain of our existing leased properties will be marketed for sublease when we determine there is excess leased capacity. Certain of these subleases contain both lease and non-lease components. Sublease income is recognized as an offset to operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Income related to non-lease components is recognized in operating expenses as a reduction to costs we incur in relation to the primary lease. 
 Impairment of ROU Assets. ROU assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. ROU assets are tested for impairment individually or as part of an asset group if the cash flows related to the ROU asset are not independent from the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An asset group is the unit of accounting for long-lived assets to be held and used, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. 
 Corporate ROU assets that are actively being marketed for sublease in connection with excess leased capacity are tested for impairment individually when the cash flows related to the ROU asset are determined to be independent from the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Corporate ROU assets are otherwise tested for impairment on a consolidated level with consideration given to all cash flows of the company as corporate functions do not generate cash flows and are funded by revenue-producing activities at lower levels of the entity. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we reassessed the asset groupings for corporate ROU assets that are actively being marketed for sublease in connection with leased office space that has been vacated as we continue to occupy our new campus facility. For asset groups where impairment was triggered, we used discounted cash flow models (an income approach) with Level 3 inputs to estimate the fair values of the asset groups and recognized corresponding impairment charges totaling million in the second quarter of 2024, of which million and million, respectively, was related to the ROU assets and tenant improvements associated with the underlying leased properties. The significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows models included projected sublease income over the remaining lease term, expected downtime prior to the commencement of executed or future subleases, and discount rates that reflected a market participant's assumptions in valuing the asset groups.

 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate convertible senior notes due May 15, 2024 (the 2024 Notes) and entered into the 2017 Indenture with respect to the 2024 Notes. Interest on the 2024 Notes was due semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. 
 In 2020, we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes for an aggregate repurchase price of million in cash. In 2022, we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes for an aggregate repurchase price of million in cash. 
 On or after January 15, 2024, holders of the 2024 Notes had the ability to convert the 2024 Notes at any time until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2024. In January 2024, we provided notice to the holders of the 2024 Notes electing to settle all conversions of the 2024 Notes which occur on or after January 15, 2024 in cash. Consequently, the embedded conversion option of the 2024 Notes (the conversion feature) required bifurcation and separate accounting from the 2024 Notes as it no longer qualified for the equity scope exception under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Upon bifurcation of the conversion feature, we recorded a derivative liability at a fair value of million (Level 3) and a corresponding debt discount that was accreted over the remaining term of the 2024 Notes using the straight-line method. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative liability and accretion of the associated debt discount were recorded in other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, holders of the 2024 Notes converted million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes for million in cash, reflecting a conversion premium of million calculated based on the per share volume-weighted average price (VWAP) for each of the consecutive trading days during the observation period (as more fully described in the 2017 Indenture). The 2024 Notes were settled in full upon maturity on May 15, 2024.

Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in Part II, Item 1A under the caption Risk Factors. The interim financial statements and this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which are contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the six months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Overview 
 Neurocrine Biosciences is a neuroscience-focused, biopharmaceutical company with a simple purpose: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options. We are dedicated to discovering and developing life-changing treatments for patients with under-addressed neurological, neuroendocrine and neuropsychiatric disorders. The company s diverse portfolio includes U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments for tardive dyskinesia, chorea associated with Huntington's disease, endometriosis and uterine fibroids in collaboration with AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie), as well as a diversified portfolio of multiple compounds in mid- to late-phase clinical development across our core therapeutic areas. 
 We launched INGREZZA (valbenazine) in the U.S. as the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in May 2017 and for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease in August 2023. We estimate that tardive dyskinesia affects approximately 800,000 people in the U.S. and approximately 90 of the 40,0000 people in in the U.S. diagnosed with Huntington s disease will develop chorea. Key elements of our commercial strategy include maximizing the opportunity in INGREZZA through consistent and effective commercial execution, continued development of valbenazine as the best-in-class treatment for new patient populations and to lead the evolving understanding of VMAT2 biology and its role in disease. INGREZZA net product sales accounted for approximately 99 of our total net product sales for the first nine months of 2024. 
 Our partner Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (MTPC) launched DYSVAL (valbenazine) in Japan for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in June 2022 and subsequently in other select Asian markets, where it is marketed as REMLEAS (valbenazine). We receive royalties at tiered percentage rates on MTPC net sales of valbenazine. 
 Our partner AbbVie launched ORILISSA (elagolix tablets) in the U.S. for the treatment of endometriosis in August 2018 and ORIAHNN (elagolix, estradiol and norethindrone acetate capsules and elagolix capsules) in the U.S. for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids in June 2020. We receive royalties at tiered percentage rates on AbbVie net sales of elagolix.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We believe that our existing capital resources, funds generated by anticipated INGREZZA net product sales, and investment income will be sufficient to satisfy our current and projected funding requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot guarantee that our existing capital resources and anticipated revenues will be sufficient to conduct and complete all of our research and development programs or commercialization activities as planned. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable or pursue opportunities to obtain debt financing in the future. We may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances or other financing mechanisms. However, we cannot provide assurance that adequate funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

 Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Compared with the comparable period last year, the change in cash flows from operating activities primarily reflected increased INGREZZA net product sales and lower total payments for upfront fees and development milestones achieved in connection with our collaborations, partially offset by increased cash paid for income taxes and increased investment in our expanded pre-clinical and clinical portfolio. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Periodic fluctuations in cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect timing differences related to our purchases, sales, and maturities of debt security investments and changes in our portfolio-mix. 
 Cash flows from investing activities for the comparable period last year also reflected an equity investment of 31.3 million in Voyager in connection with the expansion of our collaboration in the first quarter of 2023. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Compared with the comparable period last year, the change in cash flows from financing activities primarily reflected the settlement of the 2024 Notes in full for 308.8 million in cash, partially offset by increased proceeds from issuances of our common stock.

Material Cash Requirements 
 In the pharmaceutical industry, it can take a significant amount of time and capital resources to successfully complete all stages of research and development and commercialize a product candidate, which ultimate length of time and spend required cannot be accurately estimated as it varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. 
 The funding necessary to execute our business strategies is subject to numerous uncertainties and we may be required to make substantial expenditures if unforeseen difficulties arise in certain areas of our business. In particular, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the commercial success of INGREZZA, ORILISSA, ORIAHNN, DYSVAL, and/or any of our other products; 
 continued scientific progress in our research and clinical development programs; 
 the magnitude and complexity of our research and development programs; 
 progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals; 
 the costs involved in filing and pursuing patent applications, enforcing patent claims, or engaging in interference proceedings or other patent litigation; 
 costs associated with securing adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products; 
 competing technological and market developments; 
 developments related to any future litigation; 
 the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, including our advertising campaigns; and 
 the cost of manufacturing our product candidates. 
 In addition to the foregoing factors, we have significant future capital requirements, including: 
 External Business Developments. In addition to our independent efforts to develop and market products, we may enter into collaboration and license agreements or acquire businesses from time-to-time to enhance our drug development and commercial capabilities. With respect to our existing collaboration and license agreements, we may be required to make potential future payments of up to approximately 17.7 billion upon the achievement of certain milestones. 
 Refer to Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our significant collaboration and license agreements. 
 Leases. Our operating leases that have commenced have terms that expire beginning 2025 through 2036 and consist of office space and research and development laboratories, including our corporate headquarters. 
 On February 8, 2022, we entered into a lease agreement for a four-building campus facility to be constructed in San Diego, California, including a six-year option for the construction of a fifth building. This campus facility, comprised of office space and research and development laboratories, now serves as our corporate headquarters. 
 The construction of the campus facility is phased. The first phase of construction, consisting of two buildings relating to office space, was completed in December 2023. The second phase of construction, consisting of two buildings relating to laboratory space, is scheduled for completion by the end of 2024. As we continue to occupy our new campus facility, we will sublease certain of our existing leased premises when we determine there is excess leased capacity. 
 Refer to Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our leases, including a presentation of our approximate future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases. 
 Share Repurchase Program. In addition to the foregoing future capital requirements, in October 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 300 million of our common stock, which we intend to execute by entering into an accelerated share repurchase transaction with a financial institution, subject to market conditions. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There were no changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 23 

Interest Rate Risk 
 We maintain a diversified investment portfolio consisting of low-risk, investment-grade debt securities with maturities of up to three years, including investments in commercial paper, securities of government-sponsored entities and corporate bonds that are subject to interest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. If a 1 unfavorable change in interest rates were to have occurred on September 30, 2024, it would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date.

Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 A discussion of our exposure to, and management of, market risk appears in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the heading Interest Rate Risk. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports required by the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timelines specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the quarter covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 An evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of any changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 24 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we implemented a new company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. As part of the system implementation, we assessed the impact to the control environment and modified internal controls where necessary. There were no other significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 25 

Part II. Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may become subject to legal proceedings or claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We currently believe that none of the claims or actions pending against us is likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Given the unpredictability inherent in litigation, however, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 The following information sets forth risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and those we may make from time to time. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition could be harmed. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also affect our business operations. The risk factors set forth below with an asterisk ) contain changes to the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Summary Risk Factors 
 We face risks and uncertainties related to our business, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, risks associated with our business include: 
 We may not be able to continue to successfully commercialize INGREZZA or any of our other products, or any of our product candidates if they are approved in the future. 
 If physicians and patients do not continue to accept INGREZZA or do not accept any of our other products, or our sales and marketing efforts are not effective, we may not generate sufficient revenue. 
 Enacted healthcare reform, drug pricing measures and other recent legislative initiatives, including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, could adversely affect our business. 
 We face intense competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, the demand for our products may be reduced. 
 Our clinical trials may be delayed for safety or other reasons, or fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval. 
 Because the development of our product candidates is subject to a substantial degree of technological uncertainty, we may not succeed in developing any of our product candidates. 
 We depend on our current collaborators for the development and commercialization of several of our products and product candidates and may need to enter into future collaborations to develop and commercialize certain of our product candidates. 
 Use of our approved products or those of our collaborators could be associated with side effects or adverse events. 
 We have increased the size of our organization and will need to continue to increase the size of our organization. We may encounter difficulties with managing our growth, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 If we are unable to retain and recruit qualified scientists and other employees or if any of our key senior executives discontinues his or her employment with us, it may delay our development efforts or impact our commercialization of INGREZZA or any of our other products, or any product candidate approved by the FDA in the future. 
 We currently have no manufacturing capabilities. If third-party manufacturers of INGREZZA or any of our other products, or any of our product candidates fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our concerns, or if their performance is substandard, our ability to commercialize existing products and conduct clinical trials and develop new products could be impaired and our costs may rise. 
 We currently depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers. The loss of these suppliers, or delays or problems in the supply of INGREZZA or any of our other products or product candidates, could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully develop or commercialize INGREZZA, crinecerfont or any of our other products or product candidates. 
 We license some of our core technologies and drug candidates from third parties. If we default on any of our obligations under those licenses, or violate the terms of these licenses, we could lose our rights to those technologies and drug candidates or be forced to pay damages. 
 
 26 

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could develop and market products based on our discoveries, which may reduce demand for our products. 
 Government and third-party payors may impose sales and pharmaceutical pricing controls on our products, or limit coverage and/or reimbursement for our products or impose policies and/or make decisions regarding the status of our products that could limit our product revenues and delay sustained profitability. 
 We expect to increase our expenses for the foreseeable future, and we may not be able to sustain profitability. 
 Our customers are concentrated and therefore the loss of a significant customer may harm our business. 
 We may need additional capital in the future. If we cannot raise additional funding, we may be unable to fund our business plan and our future research, development, commercial and manufacturing efforts. 
 Risks Related to Our Company 
 We may not be able to continue to successfully commercialize INGREZZA or any of our other products, or any of our product candidates if they are approved in the future. 
 Our ability to produce INGREZZA revenues consistent with expectations ultimately depends on our ability to continue to successfully commercialize INGREZZA and secure adequate third-party reimbursement. Our experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products began with INGREZZA s approval in 2017, when we hired our sales force and established our distribution and reimbursement capabilities, all of which are necessary to successfully commercialize our current and future products. We have continued to invest in our commercial infrastructure and distribution capabilities since the launch of INGREZZA, including the recent expansion of our psychiatry and long-term care sales teams in September 2024. While our team members and consultants have experience marketing and selling pharmaceutical products, we may face difficulties related to managing the rapid growth of our personnel and infrastructure, and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to maintain the personnel, systems, arrangements and capabilities necessary to continue to successfully commercialize INGREZZA or any of our other products, or any product candidate approved by the FDA, or equivalent foreign authorities, in the future. 
 In addition, our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the effects of health pandemics or epidemics. In parts of the country, some hospitals, community mental health facilities, and other healthcare facilities continue to have policies that limit access of our sales representatives, medical affairs personnel and patients to such facilities. In addition, many healthcare practitioners have adopted telehealth for patient interactions, which may impact the ability of the healthcare practitioner to screen for and diagnose tardive dyskinesia or chorea associated with Huntington's disease. 
 If physicians and patients do not continue to accept INGREZZA or do not accept any of our other products, or our sales and marketing efforts are not effective, we may not generate sufficient revenue. 
 The commercial success of INGREZZA or any of our other products will depend upon the acceptance of those products as safe and effective by the medical community and patients. 
 The market acceptance of INGREZZA or any of our other products could be affected by a number of factors, including: 
 the timing of receipt of marketing approvals for additional indications; 
 the safety and efficacy of the products; 
 the pricing of our products; 
 the availability of healthcare payor coverage and adequate reimbursement for the products; 
 public perception regarding any products we may develop; 
 the success of existing competitor products addressing our target markets or the emergence of equivalent or superior products; and 
 the cost-effectiveness of the products. 
 If the medical community, patients and payors do not continue to accept our products as being safe, effective, superior and/or cost effective, we may not generate sufficient revenue. 
 
 27 

We face intense competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, the demand for our products may be reduced. 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the development and marketing of our products and product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. 
 Competition may also arise from, among other things: 
 other drug development technologies; 
 methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease, including vaccines; and 
 new small molecule or other classes of therapeutic agents. 
 Developments by others (including the development of generic equivalents) may render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. 
 We are commercializing and performing research on or developing products for the treatment of several disorders, including tardive dyskinesia, chorea associated with Huntington's disease, uterine fibroids, endometriosis, classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pain, Parkinson s disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and other neurology, neuroendocrinology, and neuropsychiatry-related diseases and disorders, and there are a number of competitors to our products and product candidates. If one or more of our competitors products or programs are successful (including the development of generic equivalents), the market for our products may be reduced or eliminated. 
 INGREZZA competes with AUSTEDO (deutetrabenazine), marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in adults and chorea associated with Huntington's disease. A once-daily dosing of AUSTEDO (AUSTEDO XR) was introduced in February 2023. Additionally, there are a number of commercially available medicines used to treat tardive dyskinesia off-label, such as XENAZINE (tetrabenazine) and generic equivalents, and various antipsychotic medications (e.g., clozapine), anticholinergics, benzodiazepines (off-label), and botulinum toxin. In addition, there are several programs in clinical development by other companies targeting Huntington's disease. 
 ORILISSA and ORIAHNN each compete with several FDA-approved products for the treatment of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, infertility and central precocious puberty. Additionally, there is also competition from surgical intervention, including hysterectomies and ablations. Separate from these options, there are many programs in clinical development which serve as potential future competition. Lastly, there are numerous medicines used to treat the symptoms of disease (vs. endometriosis or uterine fibroids directly) which may also serve as competition: oral contraceptives, NSAIDs and other pain medications, including opioids. 
 For CAH, high doses of corticosteroids are the current standard of care to both correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency as well as reduce the excessive adrenocorticotropic hormone levels. In the U.S. alone, there are more than two dozen companies manufacturing steroid-based products. In addition, there are several programs in clinical development by other companies targeting CAH. 
 Our investigational treatments for potential use in schizophrenia and depression may in the future compete with several development-stage programs being pursued by other companies. In addition, there are a number of different anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications currently used in these patient populations. 
 Our investigational treatments for potential use in epilepsy may in the future compete with numerous approved anti-seizure medications and development-stage programs being pursued by several other companies. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments specifically indicated for the early infantile epileptic encephalopathy SCN8A-DEE. 
 Our investigational treatments for potential use in neurology, neuroendocrinology and neuropsychiatry may in the future compete with numerous approved products and development-stage programs being pursued by several other companies. 
 Compared to us, many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater: 
 capital resources; 
 sales and marketing experience; 
 research and development resources, including personnel and technology; 
 regulatory experience; 
 
 28 

preclinical study and clinical testing experience; 
 manufacturing, marketing and distribution experience; and 
 production facilities. 
 Moreover, increased competition in certain disorders or therapies may make it more difficult for us to recruit or enroll patients in our clinical trials for similar disorders or therapies. 
 Our clinical trials may be delayed for safety or other reasons, or fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval. 
 Before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of any of our potential products, we must subject these product candidates to extensive preclinical and clinical testing to demonstrate their safety and efficacy for humans. Clinical trials are expensive, time consuming and may take years to complete and the outcomes are uncertain. 
 In connection with the clinical trials of our product candidates, we face the risks that: 
 the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authority may not allow an IND or foreign equivalent filings required to initiate human clinical studies for our drug candidates or the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may require additional preclinical studies as a condition of the initiation of Phase 1 clinical studies, or additional clinical studies for progression from Phase 1 to Phase 2, or Phase 2 to Phase 3, or for NDA approval; 
 the product candidate may not prove to be effective or as effective as other competing product candidates; 
 we may discover that a product candidate may cause harmful side effects or results of required toxicology or other studies may not be acceptable to the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities; 
 clinical trial results may not replicate the results of previous trials; 
 we or the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may suspend or vary the trials; 
 the results may not be statistically significant; 
 clinical site initiation or patient recruitment and enrollment may be slower or more difficult than expected; 
 the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may not accept the data from any trial or trial site outside of the U.S.; 
 a study is compromised due to patients dropping out and not completing the trials; 
 unforeseen disruptions or delays may occur, caused by man-made or natural disasters, public health pandemics or epidemics, trade restrictions or other business interruptions, including, for example, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, and the potential impact of the proposed BIOSECURE Act; and 
 regulatory requirements may change. 
 These risks and uncertainties impact all of our clinical programs and any of the clinical, regulatory or operational events described above could change our planned clinical and regulatory activities. For example, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, together with sanctions imposed on Russia, caused us to suspend all planned clinical trial activities in Russia and Ukraine. As a result, our planned clinical development timelines for valbenazine were significantly delayed while we identified and operationalized alternative clinical trial sites, which we have now done. Geopolitical tensions could also affect our ability to obtain supplies of our investigational products, which could cause delays or otherwise disrupt our clinical trials and research and development efforts. Some of our suppliers are located in China, exposing us to the possibility of supply disruption in the event of changes to the laws, rules, regulations, and policies of the governments of the U.S. or China. For example, the BIOSECURE Act, which recently passed in the House of Representatives and is now with the Senate, targets certain Chinese biotechnology companies. If this bill becomes law, or similar laws are passed, these regulations would have the potential to restrict our ability to contract with certain Chinese biotechnology companies. Such restrictions could cause delays or have other adverse effects on the development of certain of our research programs. 
 In addition, late-stage clinical trials are often conducted with patients having the most advanced stages of disease. During the course of treatment, these patients can die or suffer other adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agent being tested but which can nevertheless adversely affect clinical trial conduct, completion and results. Any failure or substantial delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates may severely harm our business. 
 
 29 

Even if the clinical trials are successfully completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit our product candidates for approval. The FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may either refuse to accept an application for substantive review or may form the opinion after review of an application that the application is insufficient to allow approval of a product candidate. To the extent that the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities do not accept our application for review or approve our application, we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates. Depending on the extent of these additional trials or any other studies that might be required, approval of any applications that we submit may be significantly delayed. It is also possible that any such additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities and we may be forced to delay or abandon our applications for approval. 
 Because the development of our product candidates is subject to a substantial degree of technological uncertainty, we may not succeed in developing any of our product candidates. 
 Only a small number of research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. 
 Potential products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons. These reasons include the possibilities that the potential products may: 
 be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during preclinical studies or clinical trials; 
 fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all; 
 be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties; 
 be difficult to manufacture on a large scale; or 
 be uneconomical to commercialize or fail to achieve market acceptance. 
 If any of our product candidates encounters any of these potential problems, we may never successfully market that product candidate. 
 We depend on our current collaborators for the development and commercialization of several of our products and product candidates and may need to enter into future collaborations to develop and commercialize certain of our product candidates. 
 We depend on our current collaborators for the development and commercialization of several of our products and product candidates and may need to enter into future collaborations to develop and commercialize certain of our product candidates. For example, we depend on AbbVie for the manufacture and commercialization of ORILISSA and ORIAHNN and for the continued development of elagolix. We collaborate with MTPC for the commercialization of DYSVAL in Japan and for the continued development and commercialization of valbenazine for movement disorders in other select Asian markets. Our additional collaborators include Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Nxera Pharma UK Limited (formerly Sosei Heptares), Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., and Xenon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 Our current and future collaborations and licenses could subject us to a number of risks, including: 
 strategic collaborators may sell, transfer or divest assets or programs related to our partnered product or product candidates; 
 we may be required to undertake the expenditure of substantial operational, financial and management resources; 
 we may be required to assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities; 
 we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our strategic collaborators devote to the development or commercialization of our products or product candidates; 
 we may not be able to influence our strategic collaborator s decisions regarding the development and collaboration of our partnered product and product candidates, and as a result, our collaboration partners may not pursue or prioritize the development and commercialization of those partnered products and product candidates in a manner that is in our best interest; 
 strategic collaborators may select indications or design clinical trials in a way that may be less successful than if we were doing so; 
 strategic collaborators may not conduct collaborative activities in a timely manner, provide insufficient funding, terminate a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new version of a product candidate for clinical testing; 
 
 30 

strategic collaborators may not pursue further development and commercialization of products resulting from the strategic collaboration arrangement or may elect to discontinue research and development programs; 
 disagreements or disputes may arise between us and our strategic collaborators that result in delays or in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management s attention and consumes resources; 
 strategic collaborators may experience financial difficulties; 
 strategic collaborators may not properly maintain, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in a manner that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation; 
 we or strategic collaborators could terminate the arrangement (in whole or in part) or allow it to expire, which would delay the development and commercialization, result in disagreements or disputes or may increase the cost of developing and commercializing our products or product candidates; 
 strategic collaborators could develop, either alone or with others, products or product candidates that may compete with ours; and 
 our strategic collaborator s decisions regarding the development and commercialization of a partnered product or product candidate within their territory(ies) could negatively impact us in the territories where we have development and commercialization rights for such product or product candidate. 
 If any of these issues arise, it may delay and/or negatively impact the development and commercialization of drug candidates and, ultimately, our generation of product revenues. 
 Use of our approved products or those of our collaborators could be associated with side effects or adverse events. 
 As with most pharmaceutical products, use of our approved products or those of our collaborators could be associated with side effects or adverse events which can vary in severity (from minor adverse reactions to death) and frequency (infrequent or prevalent). Side effects or adverse events associated with the use of our products or those of our collaborators may be observed at any time, including after a product is commercialized, and reports of any such side effects or adverse events may negatively impact demand for our or our collaborators products or affect our or our collaborators ability to maintain regulatory approval for such products. Side effects or other safety issues associated with the use of our approved products or those of our collaborators could require us or our collaborators to modify or halt commercialization of these products or expose us to product liability lawsuits which will harm our business. We or our collaborators may be required by regulatory agencies to conduct additional studies regarding the safety and efficacy of our products which we have not planned or anticipated. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we or our collaborators will resolve any issues related to any product related adverse events to the satisfaction of the FDA or any regulatory agency in a timely manner or ever, which could harm our business, prospects and financial condition. 
 We have increased the size of our organization and will need to continue to increase the size of our organization. We may encounter difficulties with managing our growth, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1,700 full-time employees. Although we have substantially increased the size of our organization, we may need to add additional qualified personnel and resources, especially with the recent increase in the size of our sales force. Our current infrastructure may be inadequate to support our development and commercialization efforts and expected growth. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on our organization, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees and implement and expand managerial, operational and financial systems and may be costly and take time away from running other aspects of our business, including development and commercialization of our product candidates. For example, we recently implemented a new company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to streamline certain existing business, operational, and financial processes. This project has required and may continue to require investment of capital and human resources, the re-engineering of processes of our business, and the attention of many employees who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the implementation or design of the ERP system could adversely affect the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our ability to accurately maintain our books and records, provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results, or otherwise operate our business. Any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 31 

Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize INGREZZA and any of our other products, or any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval in the future, will partially depend on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. In particular, as we commercialize INGREZZA, we will need to support the training and ongoing activities of our sales force and will likely need to continue to expand the size of our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources. To that end, we must be able to successfully: 
 manage our development efforts effectively; 
 integrate additional management, administrative and manufacturing personnel; 
 further develop our marketing and sales organization; 
 compensate our employees on adequate terms in an increasingly competitive, inflationary market; 
 attract and retain personnel; and 
 maintain sufficient administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls. 
 We may not be able to accomplish these tasks or successfully manage our operations and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals. Our failure to accomplish any of these goals could harm our financial results and prospects. 
 If we are unable to retain and recruit qualified scientists and other employees or if any of our key senior executives discontinues his or her employment with us, it may delay our development efforts or impact our commercialization of INGREZZA or any of our other products, or any product candidate approved by the FDA in the future. 
 We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management, commercial and scientific staff. The loss of any of these people could impede the achievement of our objectives, including the successful commercialization of INGREZZA or any of our other products, or any product candidate approved by the FDA in the future, including crinecerfont. Furthermore, recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work in the future, along with personnel with experience marketing and selling pharmaceutical products, is critical to our success. We may be unable to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, universities and non-profit research institutions for experienced scientists and individuals with experience marketing and selling pharmaceutical products. We may face particular retention challenges in light of the recent rapid growth in our personnel and infrastructure and the perceived impact of those changes upon our corporate culture. In addition, we rely on a significant number of consultants to assist us in formulating our research and development strategy and our commercialization strategy. Our consultants may have commitments to, or advisory or consulting agreements with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. 
 On October 11, 2024, Kevin Gorman, Ph.D., retired as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and Kyle Gano, Ph.D., formerly our Chief Business Development and Strategy Officer, succeeded Dr. Gorman in the CEO role. Dr. Gano also joined our Board of Directors effective as of October 11, 2024. Dr. Gorman founded Neurocrine in 1992 and has held numerous positions across the Company, including Chief Operating Officer, Chief Business Officer, and Senior Vice President of Business Development, before being appointed CEO in 2008. Dr. Gano was appointed Neurocrine s Chief Business Development Officer in 2011, and Chief Business Development and Strategy Officer in 2020, and is responsible for all of Neurocrine s business and corporate development activities. Our Board of Directors worked closely with Dr. Gorman on succession planning and believes Dr. Gano and the senior leadership team are well-positioned to continue to execute our strategy. Although Dr. Gorman will continue to serve on our Board of Directors and provide strategic direction to the Company, this leadership transition may be viewed negatively by investors, our strategic partners, or other stakeholders. Further, if the transition is not managed effectively it could disrupt our operations and impact our financial condition and results. 
 
 32 

We currently have no manufacturing capabilities. If third-party manufacturers of INGREZZA or any of our other products, or any of our product candidates fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our concerns, or if their performance is substandard, our ability to commercialize existing products and conduct clinical trials and develop new products could be impaired and our costs may rise. 
 We have in the past utilized, and intend to continue to utilize, third-party manufacturers to produce the drug compounds we use in our clinical trials and for the commercialization of our products. We have limited experience in manufacturing products for commercial purposes and do not currently have any manufacturing facilities. Establishing internal commercial manufacturing capabilities would require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to timely or successfully establish such capabilities. Consequently, we depend on, and will continue to depend on, several contract manufacturers for all production of products for development and commercial purposes, including INGREZZA. If we are unable to obtain or retain third-party manufacturers, we will not be able to develop or commercialize our products, including INGREZZA. The manufacture of our products for clinical trials and commercial purposes is subject to specific FDA and equivalent foreign regulations, including current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. Our third-party manufacturers might not comply with FDA or equivalent foreign regulations relating to manufacturing our products for clinical trials and commercial purposes or other regulatory requirements now or in the future. Our reliance on contract manufacturers also exposes us to the following risks: 
 contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving volume production, quality control or quality assurance, and also may experience shortages in qualified personnel or materials and ingredients necessary to conduct their operations. As a result, our contract manufacturers might not be able to meet our clinical schedules or adequately manufacture our products in commercial quantities when required; 
 switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly on acceptable terms, or at all; 
 our contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to successfully produce, store or distribute our products; and 
 drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, equivalent foreign regulatory authorities, and other agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. Any delay, interruption, or other issue that arises in the manufacture of our products or product candidates as a result of a failure of a third-party manufacturer to pass regulatory inspections or maintain cGMP compliance could significantly impair our ability to develop, obtain approval for, or successfully commercialize our products. 
 Our current dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of our products may reduce our profit margin, if any, on the sale of INGREZZA or any of our other products, or our future products and our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis. 
 We currently depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers. The loss of these suppliers, or delays or problems in the supply of INGREZZA or any of our other products or product candidates, could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully develop or commercialize INGREZZA, crinecerfont or any of our other products or product candidates. 
 The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of process controls required to consistently produce the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), the finished drug product and packaging in sufficient quantities while meeting detailed product specifications on a repeated basis. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products may encounter difficulties in production, such as difficulties with production costs and yields, process controls and validation, quality control and quality assurance, including testing of stability, impurities and impurity levels and other product specifications by validated test methods, compliance with strictly enforced U.S., state and non-U.S. regulations, and disruptions or delays caused by man-made or natural disasters, pandemics or epidemics, or other business interruptions. We depend on a limited number of suppliers for the production (including API) of INGREZZA, crinecerfont and our other product candidates and for the packaging of INGREZZA. If our third-party suppliers for INGREZZA, crinecerfont or any of our other product candidates encounter these or any other manufacturing, quality or compliance difficulties, our ability to successfully develop or commercialize INGREZZA, crinecerfont or any of our other product candidates could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 33 

In addition, if our suppliers fail or refuse to supply us with INGREZZA, crinecerfont or any of our other product candidates, or their APIs for any reason, or terminate our supply agreements or do not perform as agreed, it would take a significant amount of time and expense to qualify a new supplier. The FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities must approve manufacturers of the active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials used in pharmaceutical products. The loss of a supplier could require us to obtain regulatory clearance and to incur validation and other costs associated with the transfer of the API or product manufacturing processes. If there are delays in qualifying new suppliers or facilities or if a new supplier is unable to meet FDA or a similar foreign regulatory authority s requirements for approval, there could be a shortage of INGREZZA, crinecerfont or any of our other product candidates, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully develop or commercialize INGREZZA, crinecerfont or any of our other product candidates. 
 We license some of our core technologies and drug candidates from third parties. If we default on any of our obligations under those licenses, or violate the terms of these licenses, we could lose our rights to those technologies and drug candidates or be forced to pay damages. 
 We are dependent on licenses from third parties for some of our key technologies. These licenses typically subject us to various commercialization, reporting and other obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could lose important rights. If we were to default on our obligations under any of our licenses, we could lose some or all of our rights to develop, market and sell products covered by these licenses. In addition, several of our collaboration and license agreements allow our licensors to terminate such agreements if we challenge the validity or enforceability of certain intellectual property rights or if we commit a material breach in whole or in part of the agreement and do not cure such breach within the agreed upon cure period. In addition, if we were to violate any of the terms of our licenses, we could become subject to damages. Likewise, if we were to lose our rights under a license to use proprietary research tools, it could adversely affect our existing collaborations or adversely affect our ability to form new collaborations. We also face the risk that our licensors could, for a number of reasons, lose patent protection or lose their rights to the technologies we have licensed, thereby impairing or extinguishing our rights under our licenses with them. 
 Government and third-party payors may impose sales and pharmaceutical pricing controls on our products or limit coverage and/or reimbursement for our products or impose policies and/or make decisions regarding the status of our products that could limit our product revenues and delay sustained profitability. 
 Our ability to continue to commercialize INGREZZA successfully or any of our other products will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available. The continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare and the price of prescription drugs through various means may impact our revenues. These payors efforts could decrease the price that we receive for any products we may develop and sell in the future. 
 Assuming we obtain coverage for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the out-of-pocket cost of our products. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available regardless of whether they are approved by the FDA for that particular use. Coverage decisions by payors for our competitors' products may also impact coverage for our products. 
 Government authorities and other third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, such as by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Further, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors in the U.S. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. In addition, communications from government officials, media outlets, and others regarding healthcare costs and pharmaceutical pricing could have a negative impact on our stock price, even if such communications do not ultimately impact coverage or reimbursement decisions for our products. 
 
 34 

There may also be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs or indications, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. In addition, we could also be subject to amendments in our rebate agreements with pharmaceutical benefit managers that require us to pay larger rebate amounts or modify our formulary position, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. For example, government authorities could make a decision that adversely impacts the status of one of our products, which could impact the eligibility and/or the amount of government reimbursement for that product. 
 As a pharmaceutical manufacturer, we are subject to various federal statutes and regulations requiring the reporting of price data and the subsequent provision of concessions to certain purchasers/payors, including state Medicaid programs. Federal agencies issue guidance to manufacturers related to the interpretation of laws and regulations, and this guidance has changed and may change or be updated over time. In interpreting these laws, regulations and guidance, manufacturers may make reasonable assumptions to fill gaps, and these reasonable assumptions may need to be updated upon issuance of additional agency guidance. 
 If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may be unable to successfully commercialize INGREZZA or any of our other products, or any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval in the future. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition. Further, a majority of our current revenue is derived from federal healthcare program payors, including Medicare and Medicaid. Thus, changes in government reimbursement policies, government negotiation of the price of any of products, reductions in payments and/or our suspension or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Further, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of physician telehealth services rapidly increased, fueled by an unprecedented expansion of coverage and reimbursement for telehealth services across public and private insurers. The limitations that telehealth places on the ability to conduct a thorough physical examination may impact the ability of providers to screen for movement disorders, leading to fewer patients being diagnosed and/or treated. 
 Outside the United States, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. The EU provides options for EU Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, it may refuse to reimburse a product at the price set by the manufacturer or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. 
 To obtain reimbursement for our products in some European countries, including some EU Member States, we may be required to compile additional data comparing the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including those representing the larger markets. The HTA process is the procedure to assess therapeutic, economic and societal impact of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country. The outcome of an HTA will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product currently varies between EU Member States. In December 2021, Regulation No 2021/2282 on HTA, amending Directive 2011/24/EU, was adopted in the EU. This regulation, which entered into force in January 2022 will apply as of January 2025. The regulation will permit EU Member States to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU Member States will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technologies, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. If we are unable to maintain favorable pricing and reimbursement status in EU Member States for product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval, any anticipated revenue from and growth prospects for those products in the EU could be negatively affected. 
 
 35 

In light of the fact that the UK has left the EU, Regulation No 2021/2282 on HTA will not apply in the UK. However, the MHRA is working with UK HTA bodies and other national organizations, such as the Scottish Medicines Consortium, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and the All-Wales Medicines Strategy Group, to introduce new pathways supporting innovative approaches to the safe, timely and efficient development of medicinal products. 
 Legislators, policymakers and healthcare insurance funds in the EU and the UK may continue to propose and implement cost-containing measures to keep healthcare costs down, particularly due to the financial strain that the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on national healthcare systems of European countries. These measures could include limitations on the prices we would be able to charge for product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the level of reimbursement available for these products from governmental authorities or third-party payors. Further, an increasing number of EU and other foreign countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as reference prices to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. Consequently, a downward trend in prices of medicinal products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere. 
 We expect to increase our expenses for the foreseeable future, and we may not be able to sustain profitability. 
 We received FDA approval for INGREZZA for tardive dyskinesia in April 2017 and for chorea associated with Huntington's disease in August 2023. Our partner AbbVie received FDA approval for ORILISSA for endometriosis in July 2018 and for ORIAHNN for uterine fibroids in May 2020. Additionally, our partner MTPC received Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare approval for DYSVAL for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in March 2022. However, we have not yet obtained regulatory approvals for any other product candidates. Even if we continue to succeed in commercializing INGREZZA, or are successful in developing and commercializing any of our other product candidates, we may not be able to sustain profitability. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures as we: 
 commercialize INGREZZA for tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington's disease; 
 seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates or for additional indications for our current products; 
 develop, formulate, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates; 
 in-license or acquire new product development opportunities; 
 implement additional internal systems and infrastructure; and 
 hire additional clinical, scientific, sales, marketing and administrative personnel. 
 We expect to increase our expenses and other investments in the coming years as we fund our operations and capital expenditures. Thus, our future operating results and profitability may fluctuate from period to period due to the factors described above, and we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow on a sustained basis. We may not be able to generate these revenues, and we may never achieve profitability on a sustained basis in the future. In addition, there is no guarantee that our prioritization determinations regarding our R D and clinical development programs, including the acceleration or discontinuation of certain programs and product candidates, will generate their expected benefits and/or meet investor expectations. Our prioritization decisions may also adversely affect other internal programs and initiatives as well as our ability to recruit and retain skilled and motivated personnel. Our failure to maintain or increase profitability on a sustained basis could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. 
 Our customers are concentrated and therefore the loss of a significant customer may harm our business. 
 We have entered into agreements for the distribution of INGREZZA with a limited number of specialty pharmacy providers and distributors, and all of our product sales of INGREZZA are to these customers. Four of these customers represented approximately 93 of our total product sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 98 of our accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2024. If any of these significant customers becomes subject to bankruptcy, is unable to pay us for our products or is acquired by a company that wants to terminate the relationship with us, or if we otherwise lose any of these significant customers, our revenue, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected. Even if we replace the loss of a significant customer, we cannot predict with certainty that such transition would not result in a decline in our revenue, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 36 

We may need additional capital in the future. If we cannot raise additional funding, we may be unable to fund our business plan and our future research, development, commercial and manufacturing efforts. 
 Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors and we may need to raise additional capital to fund our business plan and our future research, development, commercial and manufacturing efforts. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the commercial success of INGREZZA, ORILISSA, ORIAHNN, DYSVAL, and/or any of our other products; 
 continued scientific progress in our R D and clinical development programs; 
 the magnitude and complexity of our research and development programs; 
 progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals; 
 the cost involved in filing and pursuing patent applications, enforcing patent claims, or engaging in interference proceedings or other patent litigation; 
 costs associated with securing adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products; 
 competing technological and market developments; 
 developments related to any future litigation; 
 the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, including advertising campaigns; 
 the cost of manufacturing our product candidates; 
 the impact of pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or epidemics on our business; and 
 the cost of any strategic alliances, collaborations, product in-licensing, or acquisitions. 
 We intend to seek additional funding through strategic alliances and may seek additional funding through public or private sales of our securities, including equity securities. In addition, we have previously financed capital purchases and may continue to pursue opportunities to obtain debt financing in the future. Additional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. Any additional equity financings will be dilutive to our stockholders and any debt financings may involve operating covenants that restrict our business. 
 The independent clinical investigators and contract research organizations that we rely upon to conduct our clinical trials may not be diligent, careful or timely, or may make mistakes in the conduct of our trials. 
 We depend on independent clinical investigators and CROs to conduct our clinical trials under their agreements with us. The investigators are not our employees, and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. If our independent investigators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs, or if their performance is substandard, or not in compliance with GCPs, it may delay or prevent the approval of our regulatory applications and our introduction of new treatments. The CROs we contract with for execution of our clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of the trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. Failure of the CROs to meet their obligations could adversely affect clinical development of our products. Moreover, these independent investigators and CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If independent investigators and CROs assist our competitors at our expense, it could harm our competitive position. 
 We are subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review for INGREZZA. Additionally, our other product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other post-marketing requirements and restrictions. 
 Regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates, including crinecerfont, may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. For INGREZZA, and any product candidate that the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with GCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, advertising and promotional materials for approved products must comply with FDA regulations and those of foreign regulatory authorities and may be subject to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. 
 
 37 

Failure to comply with these ongoing regulatory requirements, or later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, may result in, among other things: 
 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, changes in the product s label, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls; 
 fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on clinical trials; 
 refusal by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 adverse inspection findings, enforcement actions, or other activities that temporarily delay manufacture and distribution of our products; 
 product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and 
 product injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability on a sustained basis. 
 If the market opportunities for our products and product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our expected revenues may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer. 
 Certain of the diseases that INGREZZA, crinecerfont, and our other product candidates are being developed to address are in underserved and underdiagnosed populations. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who will seek treatment utilizing our products or product candidates, may not be accurate. If our estimates of the prevalence or number of patients potentially on therapy prove to be inaccurate, the market opportunities for INGREZZA, crinecerfont, and our other product candidates may be smaller than we believe they are, our prospects for generating expected revenue may be adversely affected and our business may suffer. 
 Because our operating results may vary significantly in future periods, our stock price may decline. 
 Our quarterly revenues, expenses and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future. Our financial results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, for among other reasons, due to seasonality and timing of customer purchases and commercial sales of INGREZZA, royalties from out-licensed products, the impact of Medicare Part D coverage, including redesign of the Part D benefit enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, our achievement of product development objectives and milestones, clinical trial enrollment and expenses, research and development expenses and the timing and nature of contract manufacturing, contract research payments, fluctuations in our effective tax rate, and disruptions caused by man-made or natural disasters or public health pandemics or epidemics or other business interruptions, including, for example, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, or in the Middle East. Because a majority of our costs are predetermined on an annual basis, due in part to our significant research and development costs, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect financial results in a quarter. Thus, our future operating results and profitability may fluctuate from period to period, and even if we become profitable on a quarterly or annual basis, we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability. Moreover, as our company and our market capitalization have grown, our financial performance has become increasingly subject to quarterly and annual comparisons with the expectations of securities analysts or investors. The failure of our financial results to meet these expectations, either in a single quarterly or annual period over a sustained period time, could cause our stock price to decline. 
 Changes in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Effective January 1, 2022, legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenses for tax purposes in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to capitalize and subsequently amortize such expenses over five years for research activities conducted in the U.S. and over 15 years for research activities conducted outside the U.S. Unless the U.S. Department of the Treasury issues regulations that narrow the application of this provision to a smaller subset of our research and development expenses or the provision is deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress, we expect a material decrease in our cash flows from operations and an offsetting similarly sized increase in our net deferred tax assets over these amortization periods. The actual impact of this provision will depend on multiple factors, including the amount of research and development expenses we will incur and whether we conduct our research and development activities inside or outside the U.S. 
 
 38 

In addition, new income, sales, use, excise or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the Inflation Reduction Act enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to such legislation may affect us, and certain aspects of such legislation could be repealed or modified in future legislation. Furthermore, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to federal tax laws. Future tax reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense. 
 Our ability to use tax attributes may be limited. 
 Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, which is generally defined as a greater than 50 change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation s ability to use certain pre-change federal tax attributes such as research and development tax credits to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. Based on completed Section 382 analysis done annually, we do not believe we have experienced any previous ownership changes, but the determination is complex and there can be no assurance we are correct. Furthermore, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. 
 Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes, including net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs or credits is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. As a result, we may be unable to use all or a material portion of our NOLs, research and development credits, and other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our future cash flows. 
 Our effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts. 
 Our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each such place. Nevertheless, our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including the impact of stock-based compensation, changes in the mix of our profitability from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations and may result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial statements. 
 The price of our common stock is volatile. 
 The market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies historically have been highly volatile, and the market for these securities has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, negatively affected the stock market and investor sentiment and resulted in significant volatility, as has the applicability of the Medicare drug price negotiation provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. Furthermore, especially as we and our market capitalization have grown, the price of our common stock has been increasingly affected by quarterly and annual comparisons with the valuations and recommendations of the analysts who cover our business. If our results do not meet these analysts forecasts, the expectations of our investors or the financial guidance we provide to investors in any period, which is based on assumptions that may be incorrect or that may change from quarter to quarter, the market price of our common stock could decline. Over the course of the last 12 months, the price of our common stock has ranged from approximately 104 per share to approximately 158 per share. 
 The market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to many factors, including: 
 sales of INGREZZA and our other products; 
 the results of our clinical trials; 
 reports of safety issues related to INGREZZA, ORILISSA, ORIAHNN, DYSVAL, or any of our other products; 
 any delay in filing an IND, NDA, marketing authorization application (MAA), or other regulatory submission for any of our product candidates, including crinecerfont, and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory agency's review of that IND, NDA, MAA, or other regulatory submission; 
 
 39 

developments concerning new and existing collaboration agreements; 
 announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by us or others, including our competitors; 
 general economic and market conditions, including economic and market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry; 
 developments in patent or other proprietary rights; 
 developments related to the FDA, CMS and foreign regulatory agencies; 
 government regulation, including the Inflation Reduction Act; 
 future sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders; 
 any trading activity in our share repurchase program; 
 comments by securities analysts; 
 additions or departures of key personnel; 
 fluctuations in our operating results; 
 potential litigation matters; 
 government and third-party payor coverage and reimbursement; 
 failure of any of our product candidates, including crinecerfont, to achieve commercial success even if approved; 
 disruptions caused by man-made or natural disasters, pandemics or epidemics or other business interruptions, including, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; and 
 public concern as to the safety of our drugs. 
 In addition, we are a member of the S P MidCap 400 index. If we cease to be represented in the S P MidCap 400 index, or other indexes or indexed products, as a result of our market capitalization falling below the threshold for inclusion in the index, certain institutional shareholders may, due to their internal policies and investment guidelines, be required to sell their shareholdings. Such sales may result in further negative pressure on our stock price and, when combined with reduced trading volume and liquidity, could adversely affect the value of your investment and your ability to sell your shares. 
 There can be no assurance with respect to the number of shares of our common stock repurchased under the share repurchase program or that any share repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. 
 In October 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 300 million of our common stock, which we intend to execute by entering into an accelerated share repurchase transaction with a financial institution, subject to market conditions. We can provide no assurance with respect to the number of shares of our common stock repurchased under the share repurchase program or that any share repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value, and it may not prove to be the best use of our cash. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program will reduce our cash reserves. 
 Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses. 
 Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, new SEC regulations and Nasdaq rules, are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in some cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased selling, general and administrative expenses and management time related to compliance activities. If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations and standards, our reputation may be harmed and we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock. 
 
 40 

Increasing use of social media could give rise to liability and result in harm to our business. 
 Our employees are increasingly utilizing social media tools and our website as a means of communication. Despite our efforts to monitor social media communications, there is risk that the unauthorized use of social media by our employees to communicate about our products or business, or any inadvertent disclosure of material, nonpublic information through these means, may result in violations of applicable laws and regulations, which may give rise to liability and result in harm to our business. In addition, there is also risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, negative posts or comments about us or our products on social media could seriously damage our reputation, brand image and goodwill. 
 We may be subject to claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers. 
 As is commonplace in the biotechnology industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 
 Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of health pandemics or epidemics, which could also cause significant disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers, CROs, or other third parties upon whom we rely. 
 Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of health pandemics or epidemics, which could also cause significant disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers, CROs and other third parties upon whom we rely. As a result, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our supply chain, ongoing and future clinical trials and commercialization of INGREZZA or any of our other products. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a remote work model for all employees except certain key essential members involved in business-critical activities. Our employees have resumed in-person interactions and have returned to the office under flexible work guidelines. However, a remote work model may nevertheless need to be reinstated at some point in the future. The effects of a remote and flexible work model may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. Remote work may also create increased risks to our information technology systems and data, as more of our employees utilize network connections, computers and devices outside our premises or network, including working at home, while in transit and in public locations. In addition, we may face several challenges or disruptions upon a return back to the workplace, including re-integration challenges by our employees and distractions to management related to such transition. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 In addition, clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to concerns for patient safety. Some patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols and our ability to recruit and retain patients, principal investigators and site staff may be hindered, which would adversely impact our clinical trial operations. 
 The ultimate effects of health pandemics or epidemics is highly uncertain and subject to change and these effects could have a material impact on our operations, or the operations of third parties on whom we rely. 
 Risks Related to Our Industry 
 Enacted healthcare reform, drug pricing measures and other recent legislative initiatives, including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, could adversely affect our business. 
 The business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are affected by the efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare and to lower drug prices. In the U.S., comprehensive drug pricing legislation enacted by the Federal government implements, for the first time, government control over the pricing of certain prescription pharmaceuticals. Moreover, in some foreign jurisdictions, pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is also subject to government control. Additionally, other federal and state laws impose obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to disclosure of new drug products introduced to the market and increases in drug prices above a specified threshold.

For example, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, which, among other things: (1) directs the Secretary of the HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare; (2) redesigns the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit to lower patient out-of-pocket costs and increase manufacturer liability; and (3) requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates on drugs whose prices increase greater than the rate of inflation. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in the ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025 and beginning in 2025, eliminates the donut hole under the Medicare Part D program and creates a new, permanent cap on beneficiary out-of-pocket spending, in addition to a newly established manufacturer discount program. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. HHS has issued and updated and will continue to issue and update guidance as these programs are implemented. These provisions took effect progressively beginning in 2023. On August 29, 2023, HHS announced the list of the first 10 drugs that will be subject to price negotiations, although the Medicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges. It is currently uncertain how the IRA will be implemented over time; however, it is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry and prescription drug pricing. 
 While the IRA drug price negotiation program targets high-expenditure drugs that have been on the market for several years without generic or biosimilar competition, we believe we will qualify for the small biotech exception from negotiation that is set to expire in 2029. 
 Additionally, beginning on January 1, 2025, the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) will implement those provisions of the IRA establishing a new Medicare Part D manufacturer discount program. Under this discount program and subject to certain exceptions, manufacturers must give a 10 percent discount on Part D program drugs in the initial coverage phase, and a 20 percent discount on Part D drugs when the beneficiary enters the catastrophic coverage phase (the phase after the patient incurs costs above the initial phase out-of-pocket threshold, which will be 2,000 beginning in 2025). However, the IRA allows the 10 and 20 percent discounts to be phased in over a multi-year period for specified manufacturers and specified small manufacturers . During this phase-in period, such manufacturers would pay a lower percentage discount on Medicare Part D program drugs. In April 2024, the Company was notified by CMS that it qualified as a specified small manufacturer and will receive the discount phase-in discussed above. INGREZZA is reimbursed under Medicare Part D, and increased discounts could impact INGREZZA revenues, while also having an industry-wide impact on the cost of other Part D program drugs such as AUSTEDO, marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries. The overall impact on INGREZZA revenues is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and we are still evaluating the potential impact of this discount program and our designation as a specified small manufacturer. 
 Our designation as a specified small manufacturer under the new Medicare Part D manufacturer discount program and our expected qualification under the small biotech exception for purposes of the Medicare drug price negotiation program are subject to various requirements and there is no assurance that we will continue to qualify for these exemptions in the future. The loss or potential loss of these exemptions, including as a result of a third party acquiring us, could have an adverse impact on our business. 
 Prior to the IRA s enactment, the most significant recent federal legislation impacting the pharmaceutical industry occurred in March 2010, when the ACA was signed into law. The ACA was intended to broaden access to health insurance and reduce the number of uninsured individuals, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. 
 Other legislative changes have been adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2 per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, will remain in effect until 2032. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, on January 5, 2024, the FDA approved Florida s SIP proposal to import certain drugs from Canada for specific state healthcare programs. It is unclear how this program will be implemented, including which drugs will be chosen, and whether it will be subject to legal challenges in the United States or Canada. Other states have also submitted SIP proposals that are pending review by the FDA. Any such approved importation plans, when implemented, may result in lower drug prices for products covered by those programs. Further, certain states through legislation have created a state PDAB to help control costs of drugs for that state. The functions of the PDABs vary by state, and may include among other things, recommending or setting upper limits on the price the state pays for certain drugs, performing drug affordability reviews, and advising state lawmakers on additional ways to reduce the state s drug spending. It is possible that the actions taken by the PDABs may result in lower prices for certain drug products sold in their states. 
 The implementation of these cost containment measures may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain sustained profitability or commercialize our drugs, particularly since the majority of our current revenue is derived from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. 
 If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could develop and market products based on our discoveries, which may reduce demand for our products. 
 Our success will depend on our ability to, among other things: 
 obtain patent protection for our products; 
 preserve our trade secrets; 
 prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights; and 
 operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, both in the U.S. and internationally. 
 Because of the substantial length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development and regulatory approval processes in order to reach the marketplace, the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Accordingly, we intend to seek patent protection for our proprietary technology and compounds. However, we face the risk that we may not obtain any of these patents and that the breadth of claims we obtain, if any, may not provide adequate protection of our proprietary technology or compounds. Additionally, if our employees, commercial collaborators or consultants use generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to develop our proprietary technology and compounds, it may impact our ability to obtain or successfully defend certain intellectual property rights. 
 We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our commercial collaborators, employees and consultants. We also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and some, but not all, of our commercial collaborators and consultants. However, if our employees, commercial collaborators or consultants breach these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently discovered by our competitors. 
 
 43 

In addition, although we own a number of patents, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability, and third parties may challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents. We cannot assure you how much protection, if any, will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court or in other proceedings. It is possible that a competitor may successfully challenge our patents or that challenges will result in limitations of their coverage. Moreover, competitors may infringe our patents or successfully avoid them through design innovation. In addition, potential competitors have in the past and may in the future file an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of our products, or our competitors products, before the expiration of the patents covering our products or our competitors products, as applicable. To prevent infringement or unauthorized use, we have in the past and may in the future need to file infringement claims, which are expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding a court may decide that a patent of ours or a patent of a competitor is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology. Derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications (or those of our licensors) or a patent of a competitor. Litigation or derivation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. Litigation or derivation proceedings, including proceedings of a competitor, may also result in a competitor entering the marketplace faster than expected. We cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the U.S. 
 Proposed healthcare reform, drug pricing measures and other prospective legislative initiatives could adversely affect our business. 
 We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement additional government controls over the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In addition, increasing emphasis on reducing the cost of healthcare in the U.S. will continue to put pressure on the pricing and reimbursement of prescription pharmaceuticals. For example, in response to the Biden administration s October 2022 executive order, on February 14, 2023, HHS released a report outlining three new models for testing by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation which will be evaluated on their ability to lower the cost of drugs, promote accessibility, and improve quality of care. It is unclear whether the models will be utilized in any health reform measures in the future. 
 In addition, certain jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including the EU, have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies, as described further in the risk factor titled Government and third-party payors may impose sales and pharmaceutical pricing controls on our products or limit coverage and/or reimbursement for our products or impose policies and/or make decisions regarding the status of our products that could limit our product revenues and delay sustained profitability. 
 We are currently unable to predict what other additional legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the healthcare industry may be enacted in the future or what effect recently enacted federal or equivalent foreign legislation or any such additional legislation or regulation would have on our business. The pendency or approval of such proposals or reforms could result in a decrease in our stock price or limit our ability to raise capital or to enter into collaboration agreements for the further development and commercialization of our programs and products. 
 Any relationships with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers (actual and potential) and third-party payors in connection with our current and future business activities are and will continue to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 Our business operations and activities may be directly, or indirectly, subject to various federal and state healthcare laws, including without limitation, fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business activities, including, but not limited to, research, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. These laws may impact, among other things, our current activities with principal investigators and research subjects, as well as current and future sales, marketing, patient co-payment assistance and education programs. 
 
 44 

Such laws include: 
 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
 the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and Civil Monetary Penalties Laws, which impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
 HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
 HIPAA, as amended by HITECH and its implementing regulations, which also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates and their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
 the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
 analogous state, local and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures or drug pricing; state laws that require disclosure of price increases above certain identified thresholds as well as of new commercial launches in the state; state laws that create Prescription Drug Price Affordability Boards to review or attempt to cap drug spending; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state and local drug take back laws and regulations; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. While our interactions with healthcare professionals, including our speaker programs and other arrangements have been structured to comply with these laws and related guidance, it is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices, business practices of our vendors or consultants, or a rogue employee s activities, may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. For example, we maintain a patient assistance program to help eligible patients afford our products. These and other types of programs have become the subject of governmental scrutiny, and numerous organizations, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, have been subject to litigation, enforcement actions and settlements related to their patient assistance programs. If our operations or activities or those of our vendors are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other applicable governmental regulations, we may be subject to, without limitation, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate. 
 In addition, any sales of our product once commercialized outside the U.S. will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws. 
 
 45 

We could face liability if a regulatory authority determines that we are promoting INGREZZA or any of our product candidates that receives regulatory approval, for off-label uses. 
 A company may not promote off-label uses for its drug products. An off-label use is the use of a product for an indication that is not described in the product s FDA-approved label in the U.S. or for uses in other jurisdictions that differ from those approved by the applicable regulatory agencies. Physicians, on the other hand, may prescribe products for off-label uses. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician s choice of drug treatment made in the physician s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product s FDA approved labeling. A company that is found to have promoted off-label use of its product may be subject to significant liability, including civil and criminal sanctions. 
 If the FDA or any other governmental agency, including equivalent foreign authorities, initiates an enforcement action against us, or if we are the subject of a qui tam suit brought by a private plaintiff on behalf of the government, and it is determined that we violated prohibitions relating to the promotion of products for unapproved uses, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal fines or damage awards and other sanctions such as consent decrees and corporate integrity agreements pursuant to which our activities would be subject to ongoing scrutiny and monitoring to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any such fines, awards or other sanctions would have an adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial prospects and reputation. 
 If our information technology systems, those third parties upon which we rely, or our data is or were compromised, we could experience adverse impacts resulting from such compromise, including, but not limited to, interruptions to our operations such as our clinical trials, claims that we breached our data protection obligations, harm to our reputation, regulatory investigations or actions, litigation, fines and penalties, and a loss of customers or sales. 
 We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we and the third parties upon which we rely, collect, receive, store, process, generate, disclose, make accessible, protect, dispose of, transmit, use, safeguard, share and transfer, or collectively, process, confidential and sensitive electronic information on our networks and in our data centers. This information includes, among other things, de-identified or pseudonymous sensitive personal data (including health data), our intellectual property and proprietary information, the confidential information of our collaborators and licensees, and the personal data of our employees. It is important to our operations and business strategy that this electronic information remains secure and is perceived to be secure. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of third-party vendors with whom we contract, and the volume of data we retain, make such systems potentially vulnerable to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through deep fakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as fake, and phishing attacks), malicious code, malware (such as malicious code, adware, and command and control (C2)), denial-of-service attacks, credential harvesting, personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, attacks enhanced or facilitated by AI, telecommunications failures, and other similar threats. Cyber-attacks, malicious internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, and other similar activities threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our sensitive information and information technology systems, and those of the third parties upon which we rely. Such threats continue to rise, are increasingly difficult to detect, and come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer hackers, threat actors, hacktivists, organized criminal threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation states, and nation-state-supported actors (also referred to as APTs). Some actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks, including without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and other major conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including retaliatory cyber-attacks, which could materially disrupt our systems and operations, as well as our ability to conduct clinical trials. Ransomware attacks are also becoming increasingly prevalent and severe, and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations (including our ability to conduct clinical trials), loss of sensitive data (including related to our clinical trials) and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds . To alleviate the financial, operational and reputational impact of a ransomware attack, it may be preferable to make extortion payments, but we may be unwilling or unable to do so (including, for example, if applicable laws or regulations prohibit such payments). Similarly, supply chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties in our supply chain have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects, vulnerabilities, or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems and infrastructure or the information technology systems and infrastructure of third parties that support our operations. 
 
 46 

Remote work has become more common and has increased risks to our information technology systems and data, as more of our employees work from home, utilizing network connections, computers and devices outside our premises, including at home, while in transit or in public locations. 
 Additionally, natural disasters, public health pandemics or epidemics, terrorism, war and geopolitical conflicts, and telecommunication and electrical failures may result in damage to or the interruption or impairment of key business processes, or the loss or corruption of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal data. 
 Future or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities systems and technologies. Furthermore, we may discover security issues that were not found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it may be difficult to integrate companies into our information technology environment and security program. 
 As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or modify our business activities (including our clinical trial activities) to try to protect against security incidents. 
 We take steps designed to detect, mitigate, and remediate vulnerabilities in our information security systems (such as our hardware and/or software, including that of third parties upon which we rely). We may not, however, detect and remediate all such vulnerabilities including on a timely basis. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures and patches designed to address identified vulnerabilities . Vulnerabilities could be exploited and result in a security incident. 
 We rely on third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive information in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, data center facilities, encryption and authentication technology, employee email and other functions. We also rely on third-party service providers to provide other products, services, parts, or otherwise to operate our business, including clinical trial sites and investigators, contractors, manufacturers, suppliers and consultants. Our ability to monitor these third parties information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If our third-party service providers or CROs experience a security incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences. In addition, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners supply chains have not been compromised or otherwise subject to a security incident. While we may be entitled to damages if our third-party service providers fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award. 
 Although to our knowledge we, or the third parties upon who we rely, have not experienced a security incident or disruption to date that is material to us, we and our vendors have been, either directly or indirectly, the target of cybersecurity incidents and expect them to continue. While we have implemented security measures designed to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events. Furthermore, while we have implemented and are planning to implement redundancies designed to avoid interruptions to our operations, not all potential events can be anticipated and interruptions to our operations could lead to decreased productivity. 
 If we (or a third party upon whom we rely) experience a security incident, ransomware attack or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences. Such consequences may include: government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive information (including personal data); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational harm (including but not limited to damage to our patient, partner, or employee relationships) ; monetary fund diversions; diversion of management s attention; interruptions in our operations (including availability of data, loss of connectivity to our network or internet); financial loss (including decreased productivity resulting from interruptions in our operations); and other similar harms. Similarly, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, theft of our intellectual property or proprietary business information could require substantial expenditures to remedy. Applicable data privacy and security obligations may also require us to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators, and investors, of security incidents. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences. 
 
 47 

Our contracts, with for example third parties or CROs, may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. We also cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims. 
 In addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to undermine our competitive advantage or market position. Additionally, our sensitive information could be leaked, disclosed, or revealed as a result of or in connection with our employees , personnel s, or vendors potential use of generative AI technologies. 
 If we fail to obtain or maintain orphan drug designation or other regulatory exclusivity for some of our product candidates, our competitive position would be harmed. 
 In addition to any patent protection, we rely on forms of regulatory exclusivity to protect our products such as orphan drug designation. A product candidate that receives orphan drug designation can benefit from a streamlined regulatory process as well as potential commercial benefits following approval. Currently, this designation provides market exclusivity in the U.S. for seven years and EU for 10 years if a product is the first such product approved for such orphan indication. This market exclusivity does not, however, pertain to indications other than those for which the drug was specifically designated in the approval, nor does it prevent other types of drugs from receiving orphan designations or approvals in these same indications. Further, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the product is clinically superior to the orphan product or a market shortage occurs. 
 In the EU, orphan exclusivity may be reduced to six years if the drug no longer satisfies the original designation criteria or can be lost altogether if the marketing authorization holder consents to a second orphan drug application or cannot supply enough drug, or when a second applicant demonstrates its drug is clinically superior to the original orphan drug. 
 If we do not have adequate patent protection for our products, then the relative importance of obtaining regulatory exclusivity is even greater. We may not be successful obtaining orphan drug designations for any indications and, even if we succeed, such product candidates with such orphan drug designations may fail to achieve FDA approval. Even if a product candidate with orphan drug designation may receive marketing approval from the FDA, it may fail to result in or maintain orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, which would harm our competitive position. 
 The technologies we use in our research as well as the drug targets we select may infringe the patents or violate the proprietary rights of third parties. 
 We cannot assure you that third parties will not assert patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against us or our collaborators with respect to technologies used in potential products. If a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or our collaborators could be forced to stop or delay developing, manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party s intellectual property unless that party grants us or our collaborators rights to use its intellectual property. In such cases, we could be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products. However, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if our collaborators or we were able to obtain rights to the third party s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims, which could severely harm our business. 
 Our business operations may subject us to disputes, claims and lawsuits, which may be costly and time-consuming and could materially and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in disputes, claims and lawsuits relating to our business operations. In particular, we may face claims related to the safety of our products, intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition, sales and marketing practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters. Any dispute, claim or lawsuit may divert management s attention away from our business, we may incur significant expenses in addressing or defending any dispute, claim or lawsuit, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial results. 
 Litigation related to these disputes may be costly and time-consuming and could materially and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations if resolved against us. In addition, the uncertainty associated with litigation could lead to increased volatility in our stock price. 
 
 48 

Our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements. 
 We are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees and independent contractors, such as principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners and vendors, or by employees of our commercial partners could include failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, to report financial information or data accurately, to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or the trade secrets of our commercial partners, or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and other business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. Employee and independent contractor misconduct could also involve the improper use of individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. Any action against our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners or vendors for violations of these laws could result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, fines and imprisonment. 
 We face potential product liability exposure far in excess of our insurance coverage. 
 The use of any of our potential products in clinical trials, and the sale of any approved products, including INGREZZA, may expose us to liability claims. These claims might be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products. We have product liability insurance coverage for both our clinical trials as well as related to the sale of INGREZZA in amounts consistent with customary industry practices. However, our insurance may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability from any current or future clinical trials or approved products. A successful product liability claim, or series of claims, brought against us would decrease our cash reserves and could cause our stock price to fall. Furthermore, regardless of the eventual outcome of a product liability claim, any product liability claim against us may decrease demand for our approved products, including INGREZZA, damage our reputation, result in regulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications, cause clinical trial participants to withdrawal, result in costs to defend the related litigation, decrease our revenue, and divert management s attention from managing our business. 
 Our activities involve hazardous materials, and we may be liable for any resulting contamination or injuries. 
 Our research activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. If an accident occurs, a court may hold us liable for any resulting damages, which may harm our results of operations and cause us to use a substantial portion of our cash reserves, which would force us to seek additional financing. 
 We are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to data privacy and information security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we process confidential and sensitive information, including personal data, proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, data we collect about clinical trial participants in connection with clinical trials, and sensitive third-party data, on our networks and in our data centers. We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws, orders, codes, regulations and regulatory guidance regarding privacy, data protection, information security and the processing of personal information (including clinical trial data), the number and scope of which are expanding, changing, subject to differing applications and interpretations, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Our data processing activities may also subject us to other data privacy and security obligations, such as industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of data by us and by third parties on our behalf. 
 
 49 

Laws regarding privacy, data protection, information security and the processing of personal data are becoming increasingly common in the U.S. at both the federal and state level. Additionally, in the past few years, numerous U.S. states including California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling, and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA) (collectively, CCPA), requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices, and honor requests of California residents to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA allows for fines for noncompliance (up to 7,500 per intentional violation). Although some U.S. comprehensive privacy laws and the CCPA exempt some data processed in the context of clinical trials, these laws may increase compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal data we may maintain about California residents. Other states have also enacted data privacy laws and we expect more jurisdictions to pass similar laws in the future. These developments may further complicate compliance efforts, and may increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and the third parties upon whom we rely. 
 Additionally, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, imposes specific requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
 Laws in Europe regarding privacy, data protection, information security and the processing of personal data have also been significantly reformed and continue to undergo reform. For example, the EU s General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) and the UK s GDPR (UK GDPR) (collectively, GDPR) impose strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals located, respectively, within the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK. The GDPR provides for enhanced data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, obligations relating to: processing health and other sensitive data; obtaining consent of individuals; providing notice to individuals regarding data processing activities; responding to data subject requests; taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors; notifying data subjects and regulators of data breaches; and implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data. The GDPR impose substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements. For example, under the GDPR, such fines can be up to four percent of global revenue or 20 million euros under the EU GDPR / 17.5 million pounds sterling under the UK GDPR, whichever is greater in either case, and also allow for private litigation related to processing of personal data brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as EU regulations governing clinical trial data and other healthcare data, could require us to change our business practices or lead to government enforcement actions, private litigation or significant penalties against us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 We may be subject to additional foreign data laws. For example, in Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and various related provincial laws, as well as Canada s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL), may apply to our operations. As another example, the General Data Protection Law, Lei Geral de Prote o de Dados Pessoais (LGPD) (Law No. 13,709/2018), may apply to our operations. The LGPD broadly regulates processing personal data of individuals in Brazil and imposes compliance obligations and penalties comparable to those of the EU GDPR. We also target customers in Asia and may be subject to new and emerging data privacy regimes in Asia, including Japan s Act on the Protection of Personal Information and Singapore s Personal Data Protection Act.

In the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe and other jurisdictions to the U.S. or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfers laws. For example, countries in the EEA and the UK have significantly restricted the transfer of personal data to the U.S. and other countries, whose privacy laws it generally believes are inadequate. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and UK to the U.S. in compliance with law, such as the EEA standard contractual clauses, the UK s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, and the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK extension thereto (which allows for transfers for to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework), these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the U.S. If we cannot implement a valid compliance mechanism for cross-border personal data transfers or if the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and injunctions against processing or transferring personal data from Europe or elsewhere. The inability to import personal data to the U.S. may significantly and negatively impact our business operations, including by limiting our ability to conduct clinical trial activities in Europe and elsewhere; limiting our ability to collaborate with parties subject to European and other data protection laws or requiring us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Other jurisdictions may adopt similarly stringent interpretations of their data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Additionally, companies that transfer personal data out of the EEA and UK to other jurisdictions, particularly to the United States, are subject to increased scrutiny from regulators, individual litigants, and activist groups. Some European regulators have ordered certain companies to suspend or permanently cease certain transfers out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR s cross-border data transfer limitations. 
 Our employees and personnel may use generative AI technologies to perform some of their work, and the disclosure and use of personal information data in generative AI technologies is subject to various privacy laws and other privacy obligations. Governments have passed and are likely to pass additional laws regulating generative AI. Our use of this technology could result in additional compliance costs, regulatory investigations and actions, and consumer lawsuits. Furthermore, any use of generative AI to develop our proprietary technology and compounds may also impact our ability to obtain or successfully defend certain intellectual property rights. If we are unable to use generative AI, it could make our business less efficient and result in competitive disadvantages. 
 In addition to data privacy and security laws, we may contractually be subject to industry standards adopted by industry groups and, we are, or may become subject to such obligations in the future. We are also bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements regarding data privacy and security. If these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences. 
 Our obligations related to data privacy and security (and consumers data privacy expectations) are quickly changing in an increasingly stringent fashion and creating uncertainty. These obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent among jurisdictions or in conflict. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources (including, without limitation, financial and time-related resources). These obligations may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. In addition, these obligations may even require us to change our business model. 
 Although we endeavor to comply with all applicable data privacy and security obligations, we may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third-parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply such obligations that impacts our compliance posture. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences. These consequences may include, but are not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation (including class claims), additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data, imprisonment of company officials, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. In particular, plaintiffs have become increasingly more active in bringing privacy-related claims against companies, including class claims and mass arbitration demands. Some of these claims allow for the recovery of statutory damages on a per violation basis, and, if viable, carry the potential for monumental statutory damages, depending on the volume of data and the number of violations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.

BYLAWS OF NEUROCRINE BIOSCIENCES, INC. (a Delaware corporation) ARTICLE I CORPORATE OFFICES 1.1 REGISTERED OFFICE The registered office of the corporation shall be in the State of Delaware at such location and with such registered agent in charge thereof as may be established by the board of directors from time to time. 1.2 OTHER OFFICES The board of directors may at any time establish branch or subordinate offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business. ARTICLE II MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS 2.1 PLACE OF MEETINGS Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware designated by the board of directors. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. The board of directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that any meeting of stockholders shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as provided under the General Corporation Law of Delaware DGCL ). 2.2 ANNUAL MEETING The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the board of directors. In the absence of such designation, the annual meeting of stockholders shall be held on the third Tuesday in May in each year at 10:00 a.m. However, if such day falls on a legal holiday, then the meeting shall be held at the same time and place on the next succeeding full business day. At the meeting, directors shall be elected, and any other proper business may be transacted. Only such business shall be conducted as is a proper matter for stockholder action under Delaware law and as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. 2. 2.3 SPECIAL MEETING A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the board of directors, or by the chairman of the board, or by the president, or by one or more stockholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast more than ten percent (10 of the votes at that meeting. No other person or persons are permitted to call a special meeting. If a special meeting is called by any person or persons other than the board of directors, then the request shall be in writing, specifying the time of such meeting and the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by telegraphic or other facsimile transmission to the chairman of the board, the president, or the secretary of the corporation. The officer receiving the request shall cause notice to be promptly given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.4 and 2.6 of these bylaws, that a meeting will be held at the time requested by the person or persons calling the meeting, so long as that time is not less than thirty-five (35) nor more than sixty (60) days after the receipt of the request. If the notice is not given within twenty (20) days after receipt of the request, then the person or persons requesting the meeting may give the notice. Nothing contained in this paragraph of this Section 2.3 shall be construed as limiting, fixing or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the board of directors may be held. 2.4 NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS All notices of meetings of stockholders shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.6 of these bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. The notice shall specify the place, date and hour of the meeting and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called (no business other than that specified in the notice may be transacted) or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the board of directors, at the time of giving the notice, intends to present for action by the stockholders (but any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such action). The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the name of any nominee or nominees who, at the time of the notice, the board intends to present for election. 2.5 ADVANCE NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER NOMINEES AND STOCKHOLDER BUSINESS Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, (a) nominations for the election of directors, and (b) business proposed to be brought before any stockholder meeting may be made by the board of directors or proxy committee appointed by the board of directors or by any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally if such nomination or business proposed is otherwise proper business before such meeting. However, any such stockholder may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting or propose business to be brought before a meeting, or both, only if such stockholder has given timely notice in proper written form of their intent to make such nomination or nominations or to propose such 3. business. To be timely, such stockholder s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of the date specified in the corporation s proxy statement released to stockholders in connection with the previous year s annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year s proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received a reasonable time before the solicitation is made. To be in proper form, a stockholder s notice to the secretary shall set forth: (i) the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nominations or propose the business and, as the case may be, of the person or persons to be nominated or of the business to be proposed; (ii) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and, if applicable, intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (iii) if applicable, a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder; (iv) such other information regarding each nominee or each matter of business to be proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, or the matter been proposed, or intended to be proposed by the board of directors; and (v) if applicable, the consent of each nominee to serve as director of the corporation if so elected. The chairman of the meeting shall refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person or the proposal of any business not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure. 2.6 MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE Except as otherwise required by law, notice may be given in writing directed to a stockholder s mailing address as it appears on the records of the corporation and shall be given: (a) if mailed, when notice is deposited in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid; and (b) if delivered by courier service, the earlier of when the notice is received or left at such stockholder s address. So long as the corporation is subject to the proxy rules set forth in Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act, notice shall be given in the manner required by such rules. To the extent permitted by such rules, or if the corporation is not subject to Regulation 14A, notice may be given by electronic transmission directed to the stockholder s electronic mail address, and if so given, shall be given when directed to such stockholder s electronic mail address unless the stockholder has notified the corporation in writing or by electronic transmission of an objection to receiving notice by electronic mail or such notice is prohibited by Section 232(e) of the DGCL. If notice is given by electronic mail, such notice shall comply with the applicable provisions of Section 232 of the 4. DGCL. Notice may be given by other forms of electronic transmission with the consent of a stockholder in the manner permitted by Section 232(b) of the DGCL and shall be deemed given as provided therein. An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any stockholders meeting, executed by the secretary, assistant secretary or any transfer agent of the corporation giving the notice, shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice. 2.7 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AS TO NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER NOMINEES AND STOCKHOLDER BUSINESS (a) In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 2.5, and to the extent not already required by Section 2.5, the written notice required by Section 2.5 shall set include, as of the date of the notice and as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, including any person who is a member of a group (as such term is used in Rule 13d-5 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the 1934 Act )) with any such stockholder or beneficial owner with respect to the stock of the corporation)(each, a Proponent and collectively, the Proponents ): a statement (i) whether or not any Proponent will engage in a solicitation within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the 1934 Act with respect to the nomination or business proposal and, if so, the name of each participant (as defined in Item 4 of Schedule 14A under the 1934 Act) in such solicitation and the amount of the cost of the solicitation that has been and will be borne (directly or indirectly) by each participant in such solicitation, (ii) whether such person or group, in the case of a proposal of business other than nominations, will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy (through means satisfying each of the conditions that would be applicable to the corporation under either Rule 14a-16(a) or Rule 14a-16(n) under the 1934 Act) to holders (including beneficial owners pursuant to Rule 14b-1 and Rule 14b-2 under the 1934 Act) of at least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares of capital stock of the corporation required under applicable law to carry the business proposal (if applicable), (iii) confirming that such person or group, in the case of any nomination (except for a nomination made by an Eligible Stockholder pursuant to Section 2.8), will solicit the holders of at least 67 of the voting power of the corporation s stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors in support of director nominees other than the corporation s nominees, and (iv) whether any such person or group intends to otherwise solicit proxies from stockholders in support of a proposal or nomination. (b) A stockholder providing written notice required by Section 2.5 shall update and supplement such notice in writing, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice is true and correct in all material respects as of (i) the record date for the meeting and (ii) the date that is five (5) business days prior to the meeting and, in the event of any adjournment, recess or postponement thereof, five (5) business days prior to such adjourned, recessed or postponed meeting; provided, that no such update or supplement shall cure or affect the accuracy (or inaccuracy) of any representations made by any Proponent, any of its affiliates or associates, or a nominee or the validity (or invalidity) of any nomination or proposal that failed to comply with Sections 2.5, 2.7 and 2.8 or is rendered invalid as a result of any inaccuracy therein. In the case of an update and supplement pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.7(b), such update and supplement shall be received by the secretary of the corporation at the principal executive 

5. offices of the corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for the meeting. In the case of an update and supplement pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 2.7(b), such update and supplement shall be received by the secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than two (2) business days prior to the date for the meeting, and, in the event of any adjournment or postponement thereof, two (2) business days prior to such adjourned or postponed meeting. (c) To be eligible to be a nominee for election or re-election as a director of the corporation pursuant to a nomination by a stockholder under Section 2.5, Section 2.7(e) or Section 2.8, such proposed nominee or a person on such proposed nominee s behalf must deliver (in accordance with the time periods prescribed for delivery of notice under Section 2.5, 2.7(e) or 2.8, as applicable) to the secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation, a written questionnaire with respect to the background, qualification, stock ownership and independence of such proposed nominee and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made (which questionnaire shall be provided by the secretary of the corporation within ten (10) days following a written request therefor by a record stockholder) and a written representation and agreement (in the form provided by the secretary of the corporation upon written request) that such person (i) is not and will not become a party to (A) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a director of the corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question (a Voting Commitment that has not been disclosed to the corporation in the questionnaire or (B) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with such person s ability to comply, if elected as a director of the corporation, with such person s fiduciary duties under applicable law, (ii) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the corporation with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director of the corporation or a nominee that has not been disclosed therein, (iii) in such person s individual capacity and on behalf of any person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made, would be in compliance, if elected as a director of the corporation, and will comply with, all applicable publicly disclosed corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines of the corporation, as well as any applicable law, rule or regulation or listing requirement, and (iv) if elected as director of the corporation, intends to serve the entire term until the next meeting at which such candidate would face re-election. (d) A person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as a director unless the person is nominated either in accordance with Section 2.5 or Section 2.7(e) and the applicable provisions of Section 2.7 are satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these bylaws, unless otherwise required by applicable law, if any Proponent (i) provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b) promulgated under the 1934 Act with respect to any proposed nominee and (ii) subsequently (x) fails to comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-19 promulgated under the 1934 Act (or fails to timely provide reasonable evidence sufficient to satisfy the corporation that such Proponent has met the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(3) promulgated under the 1934 Act in accordance with the following sentence) or (y) fails to inform the corporation that they no longer plan to solicit proxies in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14a-19 under the 1934 Act by delivering a written notice to the secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation within two (2) business days after the occurrence of such change, then the 6. nomination of each such proposed nominee shall be disregarded (and such nominee disqualified), notwithstanding that the nominee is included as a nominee in the corporation s proxy statement, notice of meeting or other proxy materials for any annual meeting (or any supplement thereto) and notwithstanding that proxies or votes in respect of the election of such proposed nominees may have been received by the corporation (which proxies and votes shall be disregarded). If any Proponent provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b) promulgated under the 1934 Act, such Proponent shall deliver to the corporation, no later than five (5) business days prior to the applicable meeting, reasonable evidence that it has met the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(3) promulgated under the 1934 Act. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and for the avoidance of doubt, the nomination of any person whose name is included as a nominee in the corporation s proxy statement, notice of meeting or other proxy materials for any annual meeting (or any supplement thereto) as a result of any notice provided by any Proponent pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b) promulgated under the 1934 Act with respect to such proposed nominee and whose nomination is not made by or at the direction of the board of directors or any authorized committee thereof shall not be deemed to have been made pursuant to the corporation s notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) and any such nominee may only be nominated by a stockholder of the corporation pursuant to Section 2.5. (e) Special Meetings. No business may be transacted at a special meeting otherwise than specified in the notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (i) by or at the direction of the board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof), (ii) by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving notice provided for in this paragraph, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who delivers written notice to the secretary of the corporation setting forth the information required by Section 2.5 or (iii) in the case of a stockholder-requested special meeting, by any stockholder pursuant to Section 2.3. In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders (other than a stockholder- requested special meeting) for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the board of directors, any such stockholder of record may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation s notice of meeting, if written notice setting forth the information required by Section 2.5 of these bylaws shall be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the board of directors to be elected at such meeting. The stockholder shall also update and supplement such information as required under Section 2.7(b). In no event shall an adjournment or a postponement of a special meeting for which notice has been given, or the public announcement thereof has been made, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder s notice as described above.

A record holder acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners will not be counted separately as a stockholder with respect to the shares owned by beneficial owners on whose behalf such record holder has been directed in writing to act, but each such beneficial owner will be counted separately, subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.8(d), for purposes of determining the number of stockholders whose holdings may be considered as part of an Eligible Stockholder s holdings.

An Eligible Stockholder shall own shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the stockholder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and the right to direct the disposition of the shares and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A person s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which (A) the person has loaned such shares, provided that the person has the power to recall such loaned shares at any time on no more than three (3) business days notice and recalls such loaned shares within five (5) business days of being notified that its Proxy Access Nominee will be included in the corporation s proxy materials for the applicable annual meeting and holds such shares through such annual meeting; or (B) the person has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the person.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the stockholders of the corporation are entitled, pursuant to Sections 2115 and 301.5 of the California Corporations Code, to cumulate their votes in the election of directors, each such stockholder shall be entitled to cumulate votes (i.e., cast for any candidate a number of votes greater than the number of votes that such stockholder normally is entitled to cast) only if the candidates names have been properly placed in nomination (in accordance with these bylaws) prior to commencement of the voting, and the stockholder requesting cumulative voting has given notice prior to commencement of the voting of the stockholder s intention to cumulate votes. If cumulative voting is properly requested, each holder of stock, or of any class or classes or of a series or series thereof, who elects to cumulate votes shall be entitled to as many votes as equals the number of votes that (absent this provision as to cumulative voting) he or she would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to his or her shares of stock multiplied by the number of directors to be elected by him, and he or she may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute them among the number to be voted for, or for any two or more of them, as he or she may see fit. 

17. 2.12 STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the corporation in the manner required by Section 228 of the DGCL; provided that the corporation has not designated, and shall not designate, any information processing system for receiving such consents. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to such action without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by consent shall, by notice to the secretary of the corporation, request that the board of directors fix a record date. The board of directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such notice is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the board of directors pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 2.12). If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 2.12 or otherwise within ten (10) days after the date on which such notice is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 2.12, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting if prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. In the event of the delivery, in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL, to the corporation of a consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the corporation shall engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, no action by consent and without a meeting shall be effective until such inspectors have completed their review, determined that the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents delivered to the corporation in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL have been obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents, and certified such determination for entry in the records of the corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders. Nothing contained in this Section 2.12 shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the board of directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation). 18. No consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days after the first date a consent is delivered in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL, consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are delivered to the corporation in in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL, and not revoked. 2.13 RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat, the board of directors may, except as otherwise required by law, fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors and which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting. If the board of directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the board of directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting. 2.14 PROXIES Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the DGCL. 2.15 ORGANIZATION The president, or in the absence of the president, the chairman of the board, or, in the absence of the president and the chairman of the board, one of the corporation s vice presidents, shall call the meeting of the stockholders to order, and shall act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of the president, the chairman of the board, and all of the vice presidents, the stockholders shall appoint a chairman for such meeting. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting, including such matters as the regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business. Such procedures prescribed by the chairman of such meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (a) the establishment 19. of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (b) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (c) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the presiding person of the meeting or the board of directors shall determine; (d) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; (e) limitations on the time, if any, allotted to questions or comments by participants, (f) restricting the use of audio/video recording devices and cell phones; (g) complying with any state and local laws and regulations concerning safety and security; (h) procedures (if any) requiring attendees to provide the corporation advance notice of their intent to attend the meeting; and (i) any additional attendance or other procedures or requirements for proponents submitting a proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the 1934 Act.

Such list shall be arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing in this Section 2.16 shall require the corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of ten (10) days ending on the day before the meeting date: (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. 2.17 WAIVER OF NOTICE Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the DGCL or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or by electronic transmission by such person, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice or waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 20. 2.18 DELIVERY TO THE CORPORATION Whenever Article II of these bylaws requires one or more persons (including a record or beneficial owner of stock) to deliver a document or information to the corporation or any officer, employee or agent thereof (including any notice, request, questionnaire, revocation, representation or other document or agreement), the corporation shall not be required to accept delivery of such document or information unless the document or information is in writing exclusively (and not in an electronic transmission) and delivered exclusively by hand (including, without limitation, overnight courier service) or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. ARTICLE III DIRECTORS 3.1 POWERS Subject to the provisions of the DGCL and to any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors. 3.2 NUMBER OF DIRECTORS The board of directors shall consist of eleven (11) members. The number of directors may be changed by an amendment to this bylaw, duly adopted by the board of directors or by the stockholders, or by a duly adopted amendment to the certificate of incorporation. The directors shall be divided into three classes, with the term of office of the first class (Class I Directors), which class shall initially consist of four (4) directors, to expire at the 2027 annual meeting of stockholders; the term of office of the second class (Class II Directors), which class shall initially consist of four (4) directors, to expire at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders; the term of office of the third class (Class III Directors), which class shall initially consist of three (3) directors, to expire at the 2026 annual meeting of stockholders; and thereafter for each such term to expire at each third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders held after such election. 3.3 ELECTION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office as provided in Section 3.2 of these bylaws. Each director, including a director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until a successor has been elected and qualified. 3.4 RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES Any director may resign effective on giving written notice to the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors, unless the notice specifies a later time for that resignation to become effective. If the resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the board of directors may, in accordance with Section 223(d) of the DGCL, elect a successor to take office when the resignation becomes effective. 

21. Vacancies in the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote of the stockholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute a majority of the required quorum). Each director so elected shall hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of the stockholders at which the term of office of the class to which such director has been elected expires. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws: (i) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. (ii) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected. If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the DGCL. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the voting stock at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the DGCL as far as applicable. 3.5 REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. 3.6 PLACE OF MEETINGS; MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held at any place (if any) within or outside the State of Delaware that has been designated from time to time by resolution of the board. 22. In the absence of such a designation, regular meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. Special meetings of the board may be held at any place (if any) within or outside the State of Delaware that has been designated in the notice of the meeting or, if not stated in the notice or if there is no notice, at the principal executive office of the corporation. Any meeting of the board, regular or special, may be held by conference telephone or other communication equipment, so long as all directors participating in the meeting can hear one another; and all such participating directors shall be deemed to be present in person at the meeting. 3.7 REGULAR MEETINGS Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at such time as shall from time to time be determined by the board of directors. If any regular meeting day shall fall on a legal holiday, then the meeting shall be held at the same time and place on the next succeeding full business day. 3.8 SPECIAL MEETINGS; NOTICE Special meetings of the board of directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the secretary or any two directors. Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be delivered orally, personally or in writing, by telephone, including a voice messaging system or other system or technology designed to record and communicate messages, facsimile, or by electronic mail or other electronic transmission. If the notice is mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least four (4) days before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is delivered by any other permitted means, it shall be delivered at least forty-eight (48) hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. 3.9 QUORUM A majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except to adjourn as provided in Section 3.10 of these bylaws. Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present shall be regarded as the act of the board of directors, subject to the provisions of the certificate of incorporation and applicable law. To the fullest extent permitted by law, a meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the quorum for that meeting. 23. 3.10 ADJOURNMENT A majority of the directors present, whether or not constituting a quorum, may adjourn any meeting of the board to another time and place. 3.11 NOTICE OF ADJOURNMENT Notice of the time and place of holding an adjourned meeting of the board need not be given unless the meeting is adjourned for more than twenty-four (24) hours. If the meeting is adjourned for more than twenty-four (24) hours, then notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting shall be given before the adjourned meeting takes place, in the manner specified in Section 3.8 of these bylaws, to the directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment. 3.12 BOARD ACTION BY CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board of directors may be taken without a meeting, provided that all members of the board individually or collectively consent in writing or by electronic transmission to that action. After an action is taken, the consent or consents relating thereto shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board of directors in the same paper or electronic form as the minutes are maintained. 3.13 FEES AND COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS Directors and members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services and such reimbursement of expenses as may be fixed or determined by resolution of the board of directors. This Section 3.13 shall not be construed to preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity as an officer, agent, employee or otherwise and receiving compensation for those services. 3.14 APPROVAL OF LOANS TO OFFICERS The corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries, including any officer or employee who is a director of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries, whenever, in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the board of directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute. 3.15 SOLE DIRECTOR PROVIDED BY CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION In the event only one director is required by these bylaws or the certificate of incorporation, then any reference herein to notices, waivers, consents, meetings or other actions by a majority or quorum of the directors shall be deemed to refer to such notice, waiver, etc., by such sole director, who shall have all the rights and duties and shall be entitled to exercise all of the powers and shall assume all the responsibilities otherwise herein described as given to the board of directors. 24. ARTICLE IV COMMITTEES 4.1 COMMITTEES OF DIRECTORS The board of directors may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the authorized number of directors, designate one (1) or more committees, each consisting of two or more directors, to serve at the pleasure of the board. The board may designate one (1) or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. The appointment of members or alternate members of a committee requires the vote of a majority of the authorized number of directors. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he, she or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the board, but no such committee shall have the power or authority to (i) amend the certificate of incorporation (except that a committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the board of directors as provided in Section 151(a) of the DGCL, fix the designations and any of the preferences or rights of such shares relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of assets of the corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the corporation or fix the number of shares of any series of stock or authorize the increase or decrease of the shares of any series), (ii) adopt an agreement of merger or consolidation under Sections 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 or 264 of the DGCL, (iii) recommend to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporation s property and assets, (iv) recommend to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution or (v) amend the bylaws of the corporation; and, unless the board resolution establishing the committee, the bylaws or the certificate of incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend, to authorize the issuance of stock, or to adopt a certificate of ownership and merger pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL. 4.2 MEETINGS AND ACTION OF COMMITTEES Meetings and actions of committees shall be governed by, and held and taken in accordance with, the following provisions of Article III of these bylaws: Section 2.17 (waiver of notice); Section 3.6 (place of meetings; meetings by telephone), Section 3.7 (regular meetings), Section 3.8 (special meetings; notice), Section 3.9 (quorum), Section 3.10 (adjournment), Section 3.11 (notice of adjournment) and Section 3.12 (board action by consent without meeting), with such changes in the context of those bylaws as are necessary to substitute the committee and its members for the board of directors and its members; provided, however, that the time of regular meetings of committees may be determined either by resolution of the board of directors or by resolution of the committee, that special meetings of committees may also be called by resolution of the board of directors, and that notice of special meetings of committees shall also be given to all alternate members, who shall have the right to attend all meetings of the committee.

ARTICLE VI INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER AGENTS 6.1 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS The corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the DGCL as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, indemnify any person against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a proceeding in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer or trustee or in any other capacity while serving as a director or officer. For purposes of this Section 6.1, a director or officer of the corporation shall mean any person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation. Except with respect to a proceeding to enforce a right to indemnification or advancement of expenses, the corporation shall be required to indemnify a director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such director or officer only if the initiation of such 

29. proceeding (or part thereof) by the director or officer was authorized by the board of directors of the corporation. The corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorney s fees) incurred by a director or officer of the corporation in defending any proceeding referred to in this Section 6.1 in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that payment of expenses incurred by a director or officer of the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it should ultimately be determined that the director of officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.1. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, to the extent that a director or officer has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any proceeding referred to in the first paragraph of this Section 6.1, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorney s fees) actually and reasonably incurred thereby in connection therewith; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the final sentence of the first paragraph of this Section 6.1, any director or officer who is not a current or former director or officer of this corporation (as such term is defined in the final sentence of Section 145(c)(1) of the DGCL) shall be entitled to indemnification under this paragraph only if such person has satisfied the standard of conduct required for indemnification under Section 145(a) or Section 145(b) of the DGCL, as applicable. The rights conferred on any person by this Article shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the corporation s certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification. 6.2 RIGHT TO BRING SUIT If a claim for indemnification or advancement under Section 6.1 is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the director or officer seeking such indemnification or advancement may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. To the fullest extent permitted by law, if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, such director or officer shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by a director or officer to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by a director or officer to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the director or officer has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of 30. the corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such director or officer has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the director or officer has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the director or officer has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the director or officer, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the director or officer to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article or otherwise shall be on the corporation. 6.3 INDEMNIFICATION OF OTHERS The corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the DGCL as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, to indemnify any person (other than directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.3, an employee or agent of the corporation (other than a director or officer) shall mean any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation. 6.4 INSURANCE The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of the DGCL. 31. ARTICLE VII RECORDS AND REPORTS 7.1 MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS The corporation shall, either at its principal executive office or at such place or places as designated by the board of directors, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these bylaws as amended to date, accounting books and other records of its business and properties.

A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person s interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business. 7.2 INSPECTION BY DIRECTORS Any director shall have the right to examine (and to make copies of) the corporation s stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her position as a director. 7.3 REPRESENTATION OF SHARES OF OTHER CORPORATIONS The chairman of the board, if any, the president, any vice president, the chief financial officer, the secretary or any assistant secretary of this corporation, or any other person authorized by the board of directors or the president or a vice president, is authorized to vote, consent with respect to, represent and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of the stock or voting securities of any other corporation or corporations or entity or entities standing in the name of this corporation. The authority herein granted may be exercised either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to do so by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority. 7.4 CERTIFICATION AND INSPECTION OF BYLAWS The original or a copy of these bylaws, as amended or otherwise altered to date, certified by the secretary, shall be kept at the corporation s principal executive office and shall be open to inspection by the stockholders of the corporation, at all reasonable times during office hours. 32. ARTICLE VIII GENERAL MATTERS 8.1 RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) days before any such action. In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law. If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the applicable resolution. 8.2 CHECKS; DRAFTS; EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments. 8.3 CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS HOW EXECUTED The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize and empower any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such power and authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount. 8.4 STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, any two authorized officers of the corporation, including, without limitation, the chairman of the board of directors, vice-chairman of the board of directors, the president, vice-president, treasurer, an assistant treasurer, the secretary or an assistant secretary representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on 

33. the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the board of directors may designate. Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books. The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon. 8.5 SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the DGCL, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. 8.6 LOST CERTIFICATES Except as provided in this Section 8.6, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The corporation may issue a new share certificate or uncertificated shares in place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of new certificate or uncertificated shares. 34. 8.7 TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS The board of directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company -- either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the board of directors may designate. 8.8 CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction and definitions in the DGCL shall govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, as used in these bylaws, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term person includes both an entity and a natural person. ARTICLE IX AMENDMENTS The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote or by the board of directors of the corporation. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws. ARTICLE X FORUM FOR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES 10.1 Unless the corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, another state court located within the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) and any appellate court therefrom shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the following claims or causes of action under Delaware statutory or common law: (a) any derivative claim or cause of action brought on behalf of the corporation; (b) any claim or cause of action for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the corporation, to the corporation or the corporation s stockholders; (c) any claim or cause of action against the corporation or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the corporation, arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of the corporation; (d) any claim or cause of action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of the corporation (including any right, obligation, or remedy thereunder); (e) any claim or cause of action as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (f) any claim or cause of action against the corporation or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the corporation, governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This Section 10.1 shall not apply 35. to claims or causes of action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the 1933 Act, or the 1934 Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. 10.2 Unless the corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the 1933 Act. 10.3 Any person or entity holding, owning or otherwise acquiring any interest in any security of the corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article.

(d) Shares Not Available For Subsequent Issuance. If any shares subject to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participant because the Stock Award is exercised through a reduction of shares subject to the Stock Award (i.e., net exercised ), the number of shares that are not delivered to the Participant shall no longer be available for issuance under the Plan. Also, any shares used to pay the exercise price of a Stock Award or that are withheld in satisfaction of applicable tax withholding obligations shall no longer be available for issuance under the Plan. Any shares repurchased on the open market with the proceeds of the exercise price of a Stock Award shall not again be available for issuance under the Plan. (e) Incentive Stock Option Limit.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any additional Options, SARs or Other Stock Awards whose value is determined by reference to an increase over an exercise or 110132325 v9 7. strike price of at least one hundred percent (100 of the Fair Market Value on the date the Stock Award are granted to any Participant during any calendar year, compensation attributable to the exercise of such additional Stock Awards shall not satisfy the requirements to be considered qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code unless such additional Stock Awards are approved by the Company s stockholders. (g) Non-Employee Director Compensation Limit. The aggregate value of all compensation granted or paid, as applicable, to any individual for service as a Non-Employee Director with respect to any period commencing on the date of the Company s regular Annual Meeting for a particular year and ending on the date of the Company s regular Annual Meeting for the next subsequent year (the Annual Period ), including Awards granted and cash fees paid by the Company to such Non-Employee Director, will not exceed one million two hundred fifty thousand dollars 1,250,000) in total value. In addition, the aggregate value of the Initial Award(s) (or other similar stock award(s) granted under the Plan or otherwise to any individual for service as a Non-Employee Director upon or in connection with his or her initial election or appointment to the Board) will not exceed two million dollars 2,000,000) in total value; for the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate compensation granted or paid, as applicable, to any individual for service as a Non-Employee Director with respect to an Annual Period in which such individual is first appointed or elected to the Board shall not exceed the sum of the two preceding limitations in this Section 3(g). The value of any stock awards, for purposes of the limitations described in this Section 3(g), shall be calculated based on the grant date fair value of such stock awards for financial reporting purposes. The limitations in this Section 3(g) shall apply beginning with the Annual period in which the Company s 2016 Annual Meeting occurs. The Board may make an exception to the applicable limit in this Section 3(g) for any Non-Employee Director in extraordinary circumstances, as the Board may determine in its discretion, provided that any Non- Employee Director who is granted or paid such additional compensation may not participate in the decision to grant or pay such additional compensation. (h) Source of Shares. The stock issuable under the Plan shall be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock, including shares repurchased by the Company on the open market or otherwise; provided, however that the Company may not repurchase shares to be used under this Plan to the extent such repurchased shares would exceed the limitation in Section 3(a). 4. ELIGIBILITY. (a) Eligibility for Specific Stock Awards. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or a parent corporation or subsidiary corporation thereof (as such terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and (f) of the Code). Stock Awards other than Incentive Stock Options may be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants; provided, however, Nonstatutory Stock Options and SARs may not be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants who are providing Continuous Service only to any parent of the Company, as such term is defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act, unless the stock underlying such Stock Awards is treated as service recipient stock under Section 409A of the Code because the Stock Awards are granted pursuant to a corporate transaction (such as a spin off transaction) or unless such Stock Awards comply with the distribution requirements of Section 409A of the Code. 110132325 v9 8. Stock Awards granted under the Director Grant Program in Section 7 may be granted only to Eligible Directors. (b) Ten Percent Stockholders. A Ten Percent Stockholder shall not be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless the exercise price of such Option is at least one hundred ten percent (110 of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant and the Option is not exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant. 5. PROVISIONS RELATING TO OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. Each Option or SAR shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate. All Options shall be separately designated Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options at the time of grant, and, if certificates are issued, a separate certificate or certificates shall be issued for shares of Common Stock purchased on exercise of each type of Option. If an Option is not specifically designated as an Incentive Stock Option, then the Option shall be a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The provisions of separate Options or SARs need not be identical; provided, however, that each Option Agreement or SAR Agreement shall conform to (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the applicable Award Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions: (a) Term. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, no Option or SAR shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date of its grant or such shorter period specified in the Award Agreement. (b) Exercise Price. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, the exercise price (or strike price) of each Option or SAR shall be not less than one hundred percent (100 of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Option or SAR on the date the Option or SAR is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option or SAR may be granted with an exercise price (or strike price) lower than one hundred percent (100 of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Option or SAR if such Option or SAR is granted pursuant to an assumption of or substitution for another option or stock appreciation right pursuant to a Corporate Transaction and in a manner consistent with the provisions of Sections 409A and, if applicable, 424(a) of the Code. Each SAR will be denominated in shares of Common Stock equivalents. (c) Purchase Price for Options. The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable law and as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, by any combination of the methods of payment set forth below. The Board shall have the authority to grant Options that do not permit all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the ability to use certain methods) and to grant Options that require the consent of the Company to utilize a particular method of payment. The permitted methods of payment are as follows: (i) by cash, check, bank draft or money order payable to the Company; (ii) pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that, prior to the issuance of the stock subject to the 

110132325 v9 9. Option, results in either the receipt of cash (or check) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds; (iii) by delivery to the Company (either by actual delivery or attestation) of shares of Common Stock; (iv) if the option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option, by a net exercise arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise by the whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that is necessary to satisfy the aggregate exercise price; provided, however, that the Company shall accept a cash or other payment from the Participant to the extent of any amount of the aggregate exercise price not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued; provided, further, that shares of Common Stock will no longer be subject to an Option and will not be exercisable thereafter to the extent that (A) shares issuable upon exercise are reduced to pay the exercise price pursuant to the net exercise, (B) shares are delivered to the Participant as a result of such exercise, and (C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations; or (v) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board. (d) Exercise and Payment of a SAR. To exercise any outstanding SAR, the Participant must provide written notice of exercise to the Company in compliance with the provisions of the SAR Agreement evidencing such SAR. The appreciation distribution payable on the exercise of a SAR will be not greater than an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate Fair Market Value (on the date of the exercise of the SAR) of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Common Stock equivalents in which the Participant is vested under such SAR, and with respect to which the Participant is exercising the SAR on such date, over (B) the strike price that will be determined by the Board at the time of grant of the SAR. The appreciation distribution in respect to a SAR may be paid in Common Stock, in cash, in any combination of the two or in any other form of consideration, as determined by the Board and contained in the SAR Agreement evidencing such SAR. (e) Transferability of Options and SARs. The Board may, in its sole discretion, impose such limitations on the transferability of Options and SARs as the Board shall determine. In the absence of such a determination by the Board to the contrary, the following restrictions on the transferability of Options and SARs shall apply: (i) Restrictions on Transfer. An Option or SAR shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant. Except as explicitly provided herein, neither an Option nor a SAR may be transferred. (ii) Domestic Relations Orders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option or SAR may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order; provided, however, that if an Option is an Incentive Stock Option, such Option may be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option as a result of such transfer. 110132325 v9 10. (iii) Beneficiary Designation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form provided by or otherwise satisfactory to the Company and any broker designated by the Company to effect Option exercises, designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Participant, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and receive the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. In the absence of such a designation, the executor or administrator of the Participant s estate shall be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and receive the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. (f) Vesting Generally. The total number of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option or SAR may vest and therefore become exercisable in periodic installments that may or may not be equal. The Option or SAR may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may or may not be exercised (which may be based on the satisfaction of Performance Goals or other criteria) as the Board may deem appropriate. The vesting provisions of individual Options or SARs may vary. The provisions of this Section 5(f) are subject to any Option or SAR provisions governing the minimum number of shares of Common Stock as to which an Option or SAR may be exercised. (g) Termination of Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, if a Participant s Continuous Service terminates (other than for Cause or upon the Participant s death or Disability), the Participant may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Award as of the date of termination of Continuous Service) but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date three (3) months following the termination of the Participant s Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the applicable Award Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the Award Agreement (as applicable), the Option or SAR shall terminate. (h) Extension of Termination Date. If the exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant s Continuous Service (other than for Cause or upon the Participant s death or Disability) would be prohibited at any time solely because the issuance of shares of Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act, then the Option or SAR shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of a total period of three (3) months (that need not be consecutive) after the termination of the Participant s Continuous Service during which the exercise of the Option or SAR would not be in violation of such registration requirements, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. In addition, unless otherwise provided in a Participant s Award Agreement, if the immediate sale of any Common Stock received upon exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant s Continuous Service (other than for Cause) would violate the Company s insider trading policy, then the Option or SAR shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of a period equal to the applicable post-termination exercise period after the termination of the Participant s Continuous Service during which the sale of the Common Stock received upon exercise of the Option or SAR would not be in violation of the Company s insider trading policy, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. 110132325 v9 11. (i) Disability of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, if a Participant s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant s Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of termination of Continuous Service), but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date twelve (12) months following such termination of Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Award Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the Award Agreement (as applicable), the Option or SAR (as applicable) shall terminate. (j) Death of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, if (i) a Participant s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant s death, or (ii) the Participant dies within the period (if any) specified in the Award Agreement for exercisability after the termination of the Participant s Continuous Service (for a reason other than death), then the Option or SAR may be exercised (to the extent the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of death) by the Participant s estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the Option or SAR upon the Participant s death, but only within the period ending on the earlier of (i) the date eighteen (18) months following the date of death (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Award Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement. If, after the Participant s death, the Option or SAR is not exercised within the time specified herein or in the Award Agreement (as applicable), the Option or SAR shall terminate. (k) Termination for Cause. Except as explicitly provided otherwise in a Participant s Award Agreement or other individual written agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant, if a Participant s Continuous Service is terminated for Cause, the Option or SAR shall terminate immediately upon such Participant s termination of Continuous Service , and the Participant shall be prohibited from exercising his or her Option or SAR from and after the time of such termination of Continuous Service. (l) Non-Exempt Employees. No Option or SAR, whether or not vested, granted to an Employee who is a non-exempt employee for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, shall be first exercisable for any shares of Common Stock until at least six months following the date of grant of the Option or SAR. Notwithstanding the foregoing, consistent with the provisions of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act, (i) in the event of the Participant s death or Disability, (ii) upon a Corporate Transaction in which such Option or SAR is not assumed, continued, or substituted, (iii) upon a Change in Control, or (iv) upon the Participant s retirement (as such term may be defined in the Participant s Award Agreement or in another applicable agreement or in accordance with the Company s then current employment policies and guidelines), any such vested Options and SARs may be exercised earlier than six months following the date of grant. The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option or SAR will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay. 110132325 v9 12. 6. PROVISIONS OF STOCK AWARDS OTHER THAN OPTIONS AND SARS. (a) Restricted Stock Awards. Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate. To the extent consistent with the Company s Bylaws, at the Board s election, shares of Common Stock may be (i) held in book entry form subject to the Company s instructions until any restrictions relating to the Restricted Stock Award lapse; or (ii) evidenced by a certificate, which certificate shall be held in such form and manner as determined by the Board. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Award Agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Award Agreements need not be identical; provided, however, that each Restricted Stock Award Agreement shall conform to (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions: (i) Consideration. A Restricted Stock Award may be awarded in consideration for (A) cash, check, bank draft or money order payable to the Company, (B) past services to the Company or an Affiliate, or (C) any other form of legal consideration (including future services) that may be acceptable to the Board, in its sole discretion, and permissible under applicable law. (ii) Vesting. Shares of Common Stock awarded under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement may be subject to forfeiture to the Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board. (iii) Termination of Participant s Continuous Service. If a Participant s Continuous Service terminates, the Company may receive through a forfeiture condition or a repurchase right any or all of the shares of Common Stock held by the Participant that have not vested as of the date of termination of Continuous Service under the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreement. (iv) Transferability. Rights to acquire shares of Common Stock under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement shall be transferable by the Participant only upon such terms and conditions as are set forth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, as the Board shall determine in its sole discretion, so long as Common Stock awarded under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement remains subject to the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreement. (v) Dividends. A Restricted Stock Award Agreement may provide that any dividends paid on Restricted Stock will be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture restrictions as apply to the shares subject to the Restricted Stock Award to which they relate. (b) Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Each Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements need not be identical; provided, however, that each Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement shall conform to (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions: 

110132325 v9 13. (i) Consideration. At the time of grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board will determine the consideration, if any, to be paid by the Participant upon delivery of each share of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. The consideration to be paid (if any) by the Participant for each share of Common Stock subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award may be paid in any form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board, in its sole discretion, and permissible under applicable law. (ii) Vesting. At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board may impose such restrictions on or conditions to the vesting of the Restricted Stock Unit Award as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. (iii) Payment. A Restricted Stock Unit Award will be settled by the delivery of shares of Common Stock as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement. (iv) Additional Restrictions. At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board, as it deems appropriate, may impose such restrictions or conditions that delay the delivery of the shares of Common Stock (or their cash equivalent) subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award to a time after the vesting of such Restricted Stock Unit Award. (v) Dividend Equivalents. Dividend equivalents may be credited in respect of shares of Common Stock covered by a Restricted Stock Unit Award, as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement. At the sole discretion of the Board, such dividend equivalents may be converted into additional shares of Common Stock covered by the Restricted Stock Unit Award in such manner as determined by the Board. Any additional shares covered by the Restricted Stock Unit Award credited by reason of such dividend equivalents will be subject to all of the same terms and conditions of the underlying Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement to which they relate, including any vesting restrictions. (vi) Termination of Participant s Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, such portion of the Restricted Stock Unit Award that has not vested will be forfeited upon the Participant s termination of Continuous Service. (c) Performance Awards. (i) Performance Stock Awards. A Performance Stock Award is a Stock Award that may vest or may be exercised contingent upon the attainment during a Performance Period of certain Performance Goals. A Performance Stock Award may, but need not, require the completion of a specified period of Continuous Service. The length of any Performance Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved during the Performance Period, and the measure of whether and to what degree such Performance Goals have been attained shall be conclusively determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion. The maximum number of shares covered by an Award that may be granted to any Participant in a calendar year attributable to Stock Awards described in this Section 6(c)(i) (whether the grant, vesting or exercise is contingent upon the attainment during a Performance Period of the Performance Goals) shall not exceed five hundred thousand (500,000) shares of Common Stock; provided, however that in connection with 110132325 v9 14. his or her initial employment, an Employee may be granted Performance Stock Awards for up to an additional five hundred thousand (500,000) shares of Common Stock which shall not count against such annual limit. The Board may provide for or, subject to such terms and conditions as the Board may specify, may permit a Participant to elect for, the payment of any Performance Stock Award to be deferred to a specified date or event. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board may determine that cash may be used in payment of Performance Stock Awards. Dividend equivalents may be credited in respect of shares of Common Stock covered by a Performance Stock Award, as determined by the Board and contained in the Performance Stock Award Agreement. At the sole discretion of the Board, such dividend equivalents may be converted into additional shares of Common Stock covered by the Performance Stock Award in such manner as determined by the Board. Any additional shares covered by the Performance Award credited by reason of such dividend equivalents will be subject to all of the same terms and conditions of the underlying Performance Stock Award Agreement to which they relate, including any vesting contingent upon the attainment during a Performance Period of certain Performance Goals. (ii) Board Discretion. The Board retains the discretion to reduce or eliminate the compensation or economic benefit due upon attainment of Performance Goals and to define the manner of calculating the Performance Criteria it selects to use for a Performance Period. (iii) Section 162(m) Compliance. Unless otherwise permitted in compliance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code with respect to an Award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation thereunder, the Committee shall establish the Performance Goals applicable to, and the formula for calculating the amount payable under, the Award no later than the earlier of (a) the date ninety (90) days after the commencement of the applicable Performance Period, or (b) the date on which twenty-five percent (25 of the Performance Period has elapsed, and in either event at a time when the achievement of the applicable Performance Goals remains substantially uncertain. Prior to the payment of any compensation under an Award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee shall certify the extent to which any Performance Goals and any other material terms under such Award have been satisfied (other than in cases where such relate solely to the increase in the value of the Common Stock). Notwithstanding satisfaction of any completion of any Performance Goals, to the extent specified at the time of grant of an Award to covered employees within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the number of shares of Common Stock, Options, or other benefits granted, issued, retainable and/or vested under an Award on account of satisfaction of such Performance Goals may be reduced by the Committee on the basis of such further considerations as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. (d) Other Stock Awards. Other forms of Stock Awards valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, Common Stock, including the appreciation in value thereof may be granted either alone or in addition to Stock Awards provided for under Section 5 and the preceding provisions of this Section 6. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board shall have sole and complete authority to determine the persons to whom and the time or times at 110132325 v9 15. which such Other Stock Awards will be granted, the number of shares of Common Stock (or the cash equivalent thereof) to be granted pursuant to such Other Stock Awards and all other terms and conditions of such Other Stock Awards. 7. INITIAL AND ANNUAL GRANTS TO ELIGIBLE DIRECTORS. (a) General. The Director Grant Program in this Section 7 provides that Eligible Directors shall receive certain Stock Awards at designated intervals over their period of Continuous Service on the Board. For the avoidance of doubt, all Stock Awards granted the Plan, including any Stock Awards granted under this Section 7, are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan, including but not limited to the share reserve limitations of Section 3 and the cancellation and regrant restrictions set forth in Section 2(g). (b) Eligibility. Stock Awards shall be granted under this Section 7 to all Eligible Directors who meet the criteria specified below. (c) Director Grants. (i) Initial Award.

COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY. (a) Availability of Shares. During the terms of the Stock Awards, the Company shall keep available at all times the number of shares of Common Stock reasonably required to satisfy such Stock Awards. (b) Securities Law Compliance. The Company shall seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to grant Stock Awards and to issue and sell shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Stock Awards; provided, however, that this undertaking shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act the Plan, any Stock Award or any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award. If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common Stock under the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. A Participant shall not be eligible for the grant of a Stock Award or the subsequent issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Award if such grant or issuance would be in violation of any applicable securities law. (c) No Obligation to Notify or Minimize Taxes. The Company shall have no duty or obligation to any Participant to advise such holder as to the time or manner of exercising such Stock Award.

110132325 v9 17. (b) Corporate Action Constituting Grant of Stock Awards. Corporate action constituting a grant by the Company of a Stock Award to any Participant shall be deemed completed as of the date of such corporate action, unless otherwise determined by the Board, regardless of when the instrument, certificate, or letter evidencing the Stock Award is communicated to, or actually received or accepted by, the Participant. (c) Stockholder Rights. No Participant shall be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares of Common Stock subject to such Stock Award unless and until (i) such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of the Stock Award pursuant to its terms, if applicable, and (ii) the issuance of the Common Stock subject to such Stock Award has been entered into the books and records of the Company. (d) No Employment or Other Service Rights. Nothing in the Plan, any Stock Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or in connection with any Award granted pursuant thereto shall confer upon any Participant any right to continue to serve the Company or an Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Stock Award was granted or shall affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (i) the employment of an Employee with or without notice and with or without cause, (ii) the service of a Consultant pursuant to the terms of such Consultant s agreement with the Company or an Affiliate, or (iii) the service of a Director pursuant to the Bylaws of the Company or an Affiliate, and any applicable provisions of the corporate law of the state in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated, as the case may be. (e) Incentive Stock Option 100,000 Limitation.

(f) Investment Assurances. The Company may require a Participant, as a condition of exercising or acquiring Common Stock under any Stock Award, (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the Participant s knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably satisfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial and business matters and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the merits and risks of exercising the Stock Award; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that the Participant is acquiring Common Stock subject to the Stock Award for the Participant s own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the Common Stock. The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, shall be inoperative if (A) the issuance of the shares upon the exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under the Stock Award has been registered under a then currently effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or (B) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws. The Company may, upon advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel 110132325 v9 18. deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with applicable securities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the Common Stock. (g) Withholding Obligations. Unless prohibited by the terms of a Stock Award Agreement, the Company may, in its sole discretion, satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation relating to an Award by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (i) causing the Participant to tender a cash payment; (ii) withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to the Participant in connection with the Award; (iii) withholding cash from an Award settled in cash; (iv) withholding payment from any amounts otherwise payable to the Participant; or (v) by such other method as may be set forth in the Award Agreement.

(i) Deferrals. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board, in its sole discretion, may determine that the delivery of Common Stock or the payment of cash, upon the exercise, vesting or settlement of all or a portion of any Award may be deferred and may establish programs and procedures for deferral elections to be made by Participants. Deferrals by Participants will be made in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. Consistent with Section 409A of the Code, the Board may provide for distributions while a Participant is still an employee or otherwise providing services to the Company. The Board is authorized to make deferrals of Awards and determine when, and in what annual percentages, Participants may receive payments, including lump sum payments, following the Participant s termination of Continuous Service, and implement such other terms and conditions consistent with the provisions of the Plan and in accordance with applicable law.

Any Award granted prior to the Effective Date is contingent upon timely receipt of stockholder approval to the extent required under applicable tax, securities and regulatory rules, and satisfaction of any other compliance requirements. 2. SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN. (a) Share Reserve. Exhibit 10.2 307473618 v2 2. (i) Subject to Section 2(a)(iii), any adjustment in accordance with Section 2(b), and any adjustment as necessary to implement any Capitalization Adjustment, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to Awards will not exceed the sum of: (i) the Prior Plan s Available Reserve; (ii) an additional 3,300,000 shares that were approved at the Annual Meeting in 2020; (iii) an additional 5,900,000 shares that were approved at the Annual Meeting in 2022; (iv) an additional 6,600,000 shares that were approved at the Annual Meeting in 2023; (v) an additional 3,635,000 shares that were approved at the Annual Meeting in 2024; and (vi) the number of Prior Plan s Returning Shares, if any, as such shares become available from time to time. (ii) Subject to Section 2(b), the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan will be reduced by: (A) one share for each share of Common Stock issued pursuant to an Appreciation Award granted under the Plan; (B) one share for each share of Common Stock issued pursuant to a Full Value Award granted under the Plan prior to May 18, 2022; and (C) 2.13 shares for each share of Common Stock issued pursuant to a Full Value Award granted under the Plan on or after May 18, 2022. (iii) Subject to Section 2(b), the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan will be increased by: (A) one share for each Prior Plan s Returning Share or 2020 Plan Returning Share (as defined in Section 2(b)(iii)(1)) subject to an Appreciation Award; (B) one share for each Prior Plan s Returning Share or 2020 Plan Returning Share subject to a Full Value Award that returns to the Plan prior to May 18, 2022; and (C) 2.13 shares for each Prior Plan s Returning Share or 2020 Plan Returning Share subject to a Full Value Award that returns to the Plan on or after May 18, 2022. (b) Share Reserve Operation. (i) Limit Applies to Shares Issued Pursuant to Awards. For clarity, the Share Reserve is a limit on the number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to Awards and does not limit the granting of Awards, except that the Company will keep available at all times the number of shares of Common Stock reasonably required to satisfy its obligations to issue shares pursuant to such Awards. Shares may be issued in connection with a merger or acquisition as permitted by, as applicable, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c), NYSE Listed Company Manual Section 303A.08, NYSE American Company Guide Section 711 or other applicable rule, and such issuance will not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan. (ii) Actions that Will Not Constitute Issuance of Shares and Will Not Reduce Share Reserve. The following actions will not result in an issuance of shares of Common Stock under the Plan and accordingly will not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Share Reserve and available for issuance under the Plan: (1) the expiration or termination of any portion of an Award without the shares covered by such portion of the Award having been issued; and (2) the settlement of any portion of an Award in cash (i.e., the Participant receives cash rather than shares of Common Stock). (iii) Reversion of Shares to the Share Reserve. 307473618 v2 3. (1) Shares Available for Subsequent Issuance. If any shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to an Award are forfeited back to or repurchased by the Company because of the failure to meet a contingency or condition required for the vesting of such shares, then such shares will revert to the Share Reserve and become available again for issuance under the Plan (such shares, the 2020 Plan Returning Shares ). (2) Shares Not Available for Subsequent Issuance. The following shares of Common Stock will not become available again for issuance under the Plan: (i) any shares that are reacquired or withheld (or not issued) by the Company to satisfy the exercise, strike or purchase price of an Award or a Prior Plan Award (including any shares subject to such award that are not delivered because such award is exercised through a reduction of shares subject to such award (i.e., net exercised )); (ii) any shares that are reacquired or withheld (or not issued) by the Company to satisfy a tax withholding obligation in connection with an Award or a Prior Plan Award; (iii) any shares repurchased by the Company on the open market with the proceeds of the exercise, strike or purchase price of an Award or a Prior Plan Award; and (iv) in the event that a Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan or a stock appreciation right granted under the Prior Plan is settled in shares of Common Stock, the gross number of shares of Common Stock subject to such award. 3. ELIGIBILITY AND LIMITATIONS. (a) Eligible Award Recipients. Subject to the terms of the Plan, Employees, Directors and Consultants are eligible to receive Awards. (b) Specific Award Limitations. (i) Limitations on Incentive Stock Option Recipients. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees of the Company or a parent corporation or subsidiary corporation thereof (as such terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and (f) of the Code). (ii) Incentive Stock Option 100,000 Limitation. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time of grant) with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Affiliates) exceeds 100,000 (or such other limit established in the Code) or otherwise does not comply with the rules governing Incentive Stock Options, the Options or portions thereof that exceed such limit (according to the order in which they were granted) or otherwise do not comply with such rules will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options, notwithstanding any contrary provision of the applicable Option Agreement(s). (iii) Limitations on Incentive Stock Options Granted to Ten Percent Stockholders. A Ten Percent Stockholder may not be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless (1) the exercise price of such Option is at least 110 of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant of such Option and (2) such Option is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date of grant of such Option. (iv) Limitations on Nonstatutory Stock Options and SARs. Nonstatutory Stock Options and SARs may not be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants who are 307473618 v2 4. providing Continuous Service only to any parent of the Company (as such term is defined in Rule 405) unless the stock underlying such Awards is treated as service recipient stock under Section 409A because such Awards are granted pursuant to a corporate transaction (such as a spin off transaction) or unless such Awards otherwise comply with the distribution requirements of Section 409A. (c) Aggregate Incentive Stock Option Limit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2(a) and subject to any adjustment as necessary to implement any Capitalization Adjustment, the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options is 34,135,000 shares. (d) Non-Employee Director Compensation Limit. The aggregate value of all compensation granted or paid, as applicable, by the Company to any individual for service as a Non-Employee Director with respect to any period commencing on the date of the Annual Meeting for a particular year and ending on the date of the Annual Meeting for the next subsequent year (the Annual Period ), including Awards granted and cash fees paid by the Company to such Non-Employee Director, will not exceed 1,250,000 in total value. In addition, the aggregate value of any equity award(s) granted under the Plan or otherwise by the Company to any individual for service as a Non-Employee Director upon or in connection with his or her initial election or appointment to the Board will not exceed 2,000,000 in total value; for the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate compensation granted or paid, as applicable, by the Company to any individual for service as a Non-Employee Director with respect to an Annual Period in which such individual is first appointed or elected to the Board will not exceed the sum of the two preceding limitations in this Section 3(d). The value of any equity awards, for purposes of the limitations described in this Section 3(d), will be calculated based on the grant date fair value of such equity awards for financial reporting purposes. The limitations in this Section 3(d) will apply beginning with the Annual Period in which the Annual Meeting in 2020 occurs. 4. OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. Each Option and SAR will have such terms and conditions as determined by the Board. Each Option will be designated in writing as an Incentive Stock Option or Nonstatutory Stock Option at the time of grant; provided, however, that if an Option is not so designated, then such Option will be a Nonstatutory Stock Option, and the shares purchased upon exercise of each type of Option will be separately accounted for. Each SAR will be denominated in shares of Common Stock equivalents. The terms and conditions of separate Options and SARs need not be identical; provided, however, that each Option Agreement and SAR Agreement will conform (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) to the substance of each of the following provisions: (a) Term. Subject to Section Error! Reference source not found. regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, no Option or SAR will be exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date of grant of such Award or such shorter period specified in the Award Agreement. (b) Exercise or Strike Price. Subject to Section Error! Reference source not found. regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, the exercise or strike price of each Option or SAR 

307473618 v2 5. will not be less than 100 of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant of such Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option or SAR may be granted with an exercise or strike price lower than 100 of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant of such Award if such Award is granted pursuant to an assumption of or substitution for another option or stock appreciation right pursuant to a Transaction and in a manner consistent with the provisions of Sections 409A and, if applicable, 424(a) of the Code. (c) Exercise Procedure and Payment of Exercise Price for Options. In order to exercise an Option, the Participant must provide notice of exercise to the Plan Administrator in accordance with the procedures specified in the Option Agreement or otherwise provided by the Company. The Board has the authority to grant Options that do not permit all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the ability to use certain methods) and to grant Options that require the consent of the Company to utilize a particular method of payment. The exercise price of an Option may be paid, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and as determined by the Board, by one or more of the following methods of payment to the extent set forth in the Option Agreement: (i) by cash or check, bank draft or money order payable to the Company; (ii) pursuant to a cashless exercise program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that, prior to the issuance of the Common Stock subject to the Option, results in either the receipt of cash (or check) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay the exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds; (iii) by delivery to the Company (either by actual delivery or attestation) of shares of Common Stock that are already owned by the Participant free and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances or security interests, with a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise that does not exceed the exercise price, provided that (1) the Common Stock is publicly traded at the time of exercise, (2) any remaining balance of the exercise price not satisfied by such delivery is paid by the Participant in cash or other permitted form of payment, (3) such delivery would not violate any Applicable Law or agreement restricting the redemption of the Common Stock, (4) any certificated shares are endorsed or accompanied by an executed assignment separate from certificate, and (5) such shares have been held by the Participant for any minimum period necessary to avoid adverse accounting treatment as a result of such delivery; (iv) if the Option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option, by a net exercise arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise by the whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise that is necessary to satisfy the exercise price, provided that (1) such shares used to pay the exercise price will not be exercisable thereafter and (2) any amount of the exercise price not satisfied by such net exercise is paid by the Participant in cash or other permitted form of payment; or (v) in any other form of consideration that may be acceptable to the Board and permissible under Applicable Law. 307473618 v2 6. (d) Exercise Procedure and Payment of Appreciation Distribution for SARs. In order to exercise a SAR, the Participant must provide notice of exercise to the Plan Administrator in accordance with the procedures specified in the SAR Agreement or otherwise provided by the Company. The appreciation distribution payable to a Participant upon the exercise of a SAR will not be greater than an amount equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Common Stock equivalents that are vested and being exercised under such SAR, over (ii) the strike price of such SAR. Such appreciation distribution may be paid to the Participant in the form of Common Stock or cash (or any combination of Common Stock and cash) or in any other form of payment, as determined by the Board and specified in the SAR Agreement. (e) Transferability. Options and SARs may not be transferred to third party financial institutions for value. The Board may impose such additional limitations on the transferability of an Option or SAR as it determines. In the absence of any such determination by the Board, the following restrictions on the transferability of Options and SARs will apply, provided that except as explicitly provided herein, neither an Option nor a SAR may be transferred for consideration and provided, further, that if an Option is an Incentive Stock Option, such Option may be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option as a result of such transfer: (i) Restrictions on Transfer. An Option or SAR will not be transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and will be exercisable during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant; provided, however, that the Board may permit transfer of an Option or SAR in a manner that is not prohibited by applicable tax and securities laws upon the Participant s request, including to a trust if the Participant is considered to be the sole beneficial owner of such trust (as determined under Section 671 of the Code and applicable state law) while such Option or SAR is held in such trust, provided that the Participant and the trustee enter into a transfer and other agreements required by the Company. (ii) Domestic Relations Orders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the execution of transfer documentation in a format acceptable to the Company and subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer, an Option or SAR may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order. (f) Vesting. The Board may impose such restrictions on or conditions to the vesting and/or exercisability of an Option or SAR as determined by the Board. Except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement or other written agreement between a Participant and the Company or an Affiliate, vesting of Options and SARs will cease upon termination of the Participant s Continuous Service. (g) Termination of Continuous Service for Cause. Except as explicitly otherwise provided in the Award Agreement or other written agreement between a Participant and the Company or an Affiliate, if a Participant s Continuous Service is terminated for Cause, the Participant s Options and SARs will terminate and be forfeited immediately upon such termination of Continuous Service, the Participant will be prohibited from exercising any portion (including any vested portion) of such Awards on and after the date of such termination of Continuous Service, and the Participant will have no further right, title or interest in the forfeited 307473618 v2 7. Award, the shares of Common Stock subject to the forfeited Award, or any consideration in respect of the forfeited Award. (h) Post-Termination Exercise Period Following Termination of Continuous Service for Reasons Other than for Cause. Except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement or other written agreement between a Participant and the Company or an Affiliate, subject to Section 4(i), if a Participant s Continuous Service terminates for any reason other than for Cause, the Participant may exercise his or her Option or SAR to the extent vested, but only within the following period of time or, if applicable, such other period of time provided in the Award Agreement or other written agreement between a Participant and the Company or an Affiliate; provided, however, that in no event may such Award be exercised after the expiration of its maximum term (as set forth in Section 4(a)): (i) three months following the date of such termination if such termination is a termination without Cause (other than any termination due to the Participant s Disability or death); (ii) 12 months following the date of such termination if such termination is due to the Participant s Disability; (iii) 18 months following the date of such termination if such termination is due to the Participant s death; or (iv) 18 months following the date of the Participant s death if such death occurs following the date of such termination but during the period such Award is otherwise exercisable (as provided in (i) or (ii) above). Following the date of such termination or death, as applicable, to the extent the Participant does not exercise such Award within the applicable Post-Termination Exercise Period (or, if earlier, prior to the expiration of the maximum term of such Award), such unexercised portion of the Award will terminate, and the Participant will have no further right, title or interest in the terminated Award, the shares of Common Stock subject to the terminated Award, or any consideration in respect of the terminated Award. (i) Restrictions on Exercise; Extension of Exercisability. A Participant may not exercise an Option or SAR at any time that the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon such exercise would violate Applicable Law. Except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement or other written agreement between a Participant and the Company or an Affiliate, if a Participant s Continuous Service terminates for any reason other than for Cause and, at any time during the applicable Post-Termination Exercise Period: (i) the exercise of the Participant s Option or SAR would be prohibited solely because the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon such exercise would violate Applicable Law; or (ii) the immediate sale of any shares of Common Stock issued upon such exercise would violate the Company s Trading Policy, then the applicable Post-Termination Exercise Period will be extended to the last day of the calendar month that commences following the date the Award would otherwise expire, with an additional extension of the exercise period to the last day of the next calendar month to apply if any of the foregoing restrictions apply at any time during such extended exercise period, generally without 307473618 v2 8. limitation as to the maximum permitted number of extensions; provided, however, that in no event may such Award be exercised after the expiration of its maximum term (as set forth in Section 4(a)). (j) Non-Exempt Employees. No Option or SAR, whether or not vested, granted to an Employee who is a non-exempt employee for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, will be first exercisable for any shares of Common Stock until at least six months following the date of grant of such Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in accordance with the provisions of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act, any vested portion of such Award may be exercised earlier than six months following the date of grant of such Award in the event of (i) such Participant s death or Disability, (ii) a Transaction in which such Award is not assumed, continued or substituted, (iii) a Change in Control, or (iv) such Participant s retirement (as such term may be defined in the Award Agreement or another applicable agreement or, in the absence of any such definition, in accordance with the Company s then current employment policies and guidelines). This Section 4(j) is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option or SAR will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay. (k) Whole Shares. Options and SARs may be exercised only with respect to whole shares of Common Stock or their equivalents. 5. AWARDS OTHER THAN OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. (a) Restricted Stock Awards and RSU Awards. Each Restricted Stock Award and RSU Award will have such terms and conditions as determined by the Board. The terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Awards and RSU Awards need not be identical; provided, however, that each Restricted Stock Award Agreement and RSU Award Agreement will conform (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) to the substance of each of the following provisions: (i) Form of Award. (1) Restricted Stock Awards. To the extent consistent with the Company s Bylaws, at the Board s election, shares of Common Stock subject to a Restricted Stock Award may be (i) held in book entry form subject to the Company s instructions until such shares become vested or any other restrictions lapse, or (ii) evidenced by a certificate, which certificate will be held in such form and manner as determined by the Board. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, a Participant will have voting and other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any shares subject to a Restricted Stock Award. (2) RSU Awards. A RSU Award represents a Participant s right to be issued on a future date the number of shares of Common Stock that is equal to the number of restricted stock units subject to the RSU Award. As a holder of a RSU Award, a Participant is an unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the Company s unfunded obligation, if any, to issue shares of Common Stock in settlement of such Award and nothing contained in the Plan or any RSU Award Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, will create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between a Participant and the 

307473618 v2 9. Company or an Affiliate or any other person. A Participant will not have voting or any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to a RSU Award (unless and until shares are actually issued in settlement of a vested RSU Award). (ii) Consideration. (1) Restricted Stock Awards. A Restricted Stock Award may be granted in consideration for (A) cash or check, bank draft or money order payable to the Company, (B) past services to the Company or an Affiliate, or (C) any other form of consideration (including future services) as the Board may determine and permissible under Applicable Law. (2) RSU Awards. Unless otherwise determined by the Board at the time of grant, a RSU Award will be granted in consideration for the Participant s services to the Company or an Affiliate, such that the Participant will not be required to make any payment to the Company (other than such services) with respect to the grant or vesting of the RSU Award, or the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the RSU Award. If, at the time of grant, the Board determines that any consideration must be paid by the Participant (in a form other than the Participant s services to the Company or an Affiliate) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock in settlement of the RSU Award, such consideration may be paid in any form of consideration as the Board may determine and permissible under Applicable Law. (iii) Vesting. The Board may impose such restrictions on or conditions to the vesting of a Restricted Stock Award or RSU Award as determined by the Board. Except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement or other written agreement between a Participant and the Company or an Affiliate, vesting of Restricted Stock Awards and RSU Awards will cease upon termination of the Participant s Continuous Service. (iv) Termination of Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement or other written agreement between a Participant and the Company or an Affiliate, if a Participant s Continuous Service terminates for any reason, (1) the Company may receive through a forfeiture condition or a repurchase right any or all of the shares of Common Stock held by the Participant under his or her Restricted Stock Award that have not vested as of the date of such termination as set forth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, and (2) any portion of the Participant s RSU Award that has not vested will be forfeited upon such termination and the Participant will have no further right, title or interest in the RSU Award, the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the RSU Award, or any consideration in respect of the RSU Award. (v) Settlement of RSU Awards. A RSU Award may be settled by the issuance of shares of Common Stock or cash (or any combination thereof) or in any other form of payment, as determined by the Board and specified in the RSU Award Agreement. At the time of grant, the Board may determine to impose such restrictions or conditions that delay such delivery to a date following the vesting of the RSU Award. (b) Performance Awards. With respect to any Performance Award, the length of any Performance Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved during the Performance Period, 307473618 v2 10. the other terms and conditions of such Award, and the measure of whether and to what degree such Performance Goals have been attained will be determined by the Board. In addition, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, the Board may determine that cash or other property may be used in payment of Performance Awards. Performance Awards that are settled in cash or other property are not required to be valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, the Common Stock. (c) Other Awards. Other forms of Awards valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, Common Stock may be granted either alone or in addition to Awards provided for under Section 4 and the preceding provisions of this Section 5. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board will have sole and complete discretion to determine the persons to whom and the time or times at which such Other Awards will be granted, the number of shares of Common Stock (or the cash equivalent thereof) to be granted pursuant to such Other Awards, and all other terms and conditions of such Other Awards. 6. ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN COMMON STOCK; OTHER CORPORATE EVENTS. (a) Capitalization Adjustments. In the event of a Capitalization Adjustment, the Board will appropriately and proportionately adjust: (i) the class(es) and maximum number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Plan pursuant to Section 2(a); (ii) the class(es) and maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options pursuant to Section 3(c); and (iii) the class(es) and number of shares of Common Stock and the exercise, strike or purchase price of Common Stock subject to outstanding Awards. The Board will make such adjustments, and its determination will be final, binding and conclusive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no fractional shares or rights for fractional shares of Common Stock will be created in order to implement any Capitalization Adjustment. The Board will determine an appropriate equivalent benefit, if any, for any fractional shares or rights to fractional shares that may be created by the adjustments referred to in the preceding provisions of this Section 6(a). (b) Dissolution or Liquidation. Except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement or other written agreement between a Participant and the Company or an Affiliate, in the event of a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding Awards (other than Awards consisting of vested and outstanding shares of Common Stock not subject to a forfeiture condition or the Company s right of repurchase) will terminate immediately prior to the completion of such dissolution or liquidation, and the shares of Common Stock subject to a forfeiture condition or the Company s right of repurchase may be reacquired or repurchased by the Company notwithstanding the fact that the holder of such Award is providing Continuous Service. (c) Transaction. In the event of a Transaction, the provisions of this Section 6(c) will apply to each outstanding Award unless otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the Award, in any other written agreement between a Participant and the Company or an Affiliate, or in any director compensation policy of the Company. (i) Awards May Be Assumed. In the event of a Transaction, the Acquiring Entity may assume or continue any or all outstanding Awards or may substitute similar awards 307473618 v2 11. for any or all outstanding Awards (including but not limited to, awards to acquire the same consideration paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Transaction), and any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company in respect of Common Stock issued pursuant to outstanding Awards may be assigned by the Company to the Acquiring Entity. For clarity, in the event of a Transaction, the Acquiring Entity may choose to assume or continue only a portion of an outstanding Award, to substitute a similar award for only a portion of an outstanding Award, or to assume or continue, or substitute similar awards for, the outstanding Awards held by some, but not all, Participants. The terms of any assumption, continuation or substitution will be set by the Board. (ii) Awards Held by Current Employee and Director Participants. In the event of a Transaction in which the Acquiring Entity does not assume or continue outstanding Awards or substitute similar awards for outstanding Awards, then with respect to any such Awards that have not been assumed, continued or substituted and that are held by Participants who are Employees or Directors and, in each case, whose Continuous Service has not terminated prior to the effective time of the Transaction (referred to as the Current Employee and Director Participants ), the vesting (and exercisability, if applicable) of such Awards will be accelerated in full (and with respect to any such Awards that are subject to performance- based vesting conditions or requirements, vesting will be deemed to be satisfied at the greater of (x) the target level of performance or (y) the actual level of performance measured in accordance with the applicable performance goals as of the date of the Transaction) to a date prior to the effective time of such Transaction (contingent upon the effectiveness of the Transaction) as the Board determines (or, if the Board does not determine such a date, to the date that is 15 days prior to the effective time of the Transaction), and such Awards will terminate if not exercised (if applicable) at or prior to the effective time of the Transaction, and any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company with respect to such Awards will lapse (contingent upon the effectiveness of the Transaction). With respect to the vesting of Awards that will accelerate upon the occurrence of a Transaction pursuant to this Section 6(c)(ii) and are settled in the form of a cash payment, such cash payment will be made no later than 30 days following the occurrence of the Transaction. (iii) Awards Held by Persons other than Current Participants. In the event of a Transaction in which the Acquiring Entity does not assume or continue outstanding Awards or substitute similar awards for outstanding Awards, then with respect to Awards that have not been assumed, continued or substituted and that are held by persons other than Current Employee and Director Participants, such Awards will terminate if not exercised (if applicable) at or prior to the effective time of the Transaction; provided, however, that any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company with respect to such Awards will not terminate and may continue to be exercised notwithstanding the Transaction. (iv) Payment for Awards in Lieu of Exercise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event an Award will terminate if not exercised at or prior to the effective time of a Transaction, the Board may provide that the holder of such Award may not exercise such Award but will receive a payment, in such form as may be determined by the Board, equal in value, at the effective time, to the excess, if any, of (1) the value of the property the Participant would have received upon the exercise of the Award, over (2) any exercise price payable by such holder in connection with such exercise. 307473618 v2 12. (d) Involuntary Termination Upon or Following a Transaction. Except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, in any other written agreement between a Participant and the Company or an Affiliate, or in any director compensation policy of the Company, in the event that an Employee or Director s Continuous Service is involuntarily terminated without Cause (including any such termination due to such Employee or Director s death or Disability) upon or within 12 months following the effective time of a Transaction, the vesting (and exercisability, if applicable) of any Assumed Awards (as defined in this Section 6(d)) held by such Employee or Director as of the date of such termination will be accelerated in full (and with respect to any such Awards that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions or requirements, vesting will be deemed to be satisfied at the greater of (x) the target level of performance or (y) the actual level of performance measured in accordance with the applicable performance goals as of the date of such termination), effective as of the date of such termination. For purposes of this Section 6(d), an Assumed Award means any outstanding Award that was assumed or continued, or any outstanding similar award that was granted in substitution for an Award, in each case by the Acquiring Entity in connection with the applicable Transaction. (e) Appointment of Stockholder Representative. As a condition to the receipt of an Award, a Participant will be deemed to have agreed that the Award will be subject to the terms of any agreement governing a Transaction involving the Company, including, without limitation, a provision for the appointment of a stockholder representative that is authorized to act on the Participant s behalf with respect to any escrow, indemnities and any contingent consideration. (f) No Restriction on Right to Undertake Transactions. The grant of any Award and the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to any Award does not affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Company or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company s capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of the Company, any issue of stock or of options, rights or options to purchase stock or of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stocks whose rights are superior to or affect the Common Stock or the rights thereof or which are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise. 7. ADMINISTRATION. (a) Administration by Board. The Board will administer the Plan unless and until the Board delegates administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees, as provided in Section 7(c). (b) Powers of Board. The Board will have the power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan: (i) To determine from time to time: (1) which of the persons eligible under the Plan will be granted Awards; (2) when and how each Award will be granted; (3) what type or combination of types of Award will be granted; (4) the provisions of each Award (which 

307473618 v2 13. need not be identical), including the time or times when a person will be permitted to receive an issuance of Common Stock or other payment pursuant to an Award; (5) the number of shares of Common Stock or cash equivalent with respect to which an Award will be granted to each such person; and (6) the Fair Market Value applicable to an Award. (ii) To construe and interpret the Plan and Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its administration. The Board, in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award Agreement, in a manner and to the extent it deems necessary or expedient to make the Plan or Awards fully effective. (iii) To settle all controversies regarding the Plan and Awards granted under it. (iv) To accelerate the time at which an Award may first be exercised or the time during which an Award or any part thereof will vest, notwithstanding the provisions in the Award Agreement stating the time at which it may first be exercised or the time during which it will vest. (v) To prohibit the exercise of any Option, SAR or other exercisable Award during a period of up to 30 days prior to the consummation of any pending stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation or other distribution (other than normal cash dividends) of Company assets to stockholders, or any other change affecting the shares of Common Stock or the share price of the Common Stock, including any Transaction, for reasons of administrative convenience. (vi) To suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Suspension or termination of the Plan will not Materially Impair a Participant s rights under any Award granted while the Plan is in effect unless (1) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (2) such Participant consents in writing. (vii) To amend the Plan in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable; provided, however, that stockholder approval will be required for any such amendment to the extent required by Applicable Law. Except as provided above, a Participant s rights under any Award granted before any amendment of the Plan will not be Materially Impaired by any such amendment unless (1) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (2) such Participant consents in writing. (viii) To submit any amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval. (ix) To approve forms of Award Agreements for use under the Plan and to amend the terms of any one or more Awards, including, but not limited to, amendments to provide terms more favorable to the Participant than previously provided in the Award Agreement, subject to any specified limits in the Plan that are not subject to Board discretion; provided, however, that a Participant s rights under any Award will not be Materially Impaired by any such amendment unless (1) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (2) such Participant consents in writing. 307473618 v2 14. (x) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best interests of the Company and that are not in conflict with the provisions of the Plan or Awards. (xi) To adopt such procedures and sub-plans as are necessary or appropriate to permit and facilitate participation in the Plan by, or take advantage of specific tax treatment for Awards granted to, Employees, Directors or Consultants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States (provided that Board approval will not be necessary for immaterial modifications to the Plan or any Award Agreement to ensure or facilitate compliance with the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction). (c) Delegation to Committee. (i) General. The Board may delegate some or all of the administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees. If administration of the Plan is delegated to a Committee, the Committee will have, in connection with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore possessed by the Board that have been delegated to the Committee, including the power to delegate to another Committee or a subcommittee of the Committee any of the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board will thereafter be to the Committee or subcommittee, as applicable), subject, however, to such resolutions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by the Board. Each Committee may retain the authority to concurrently administer the Plan with any Committee or subcommittee to which it has delegated its authority hereunder and may, at any time, revest in such Committee some or all of the powers previously delegated. The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the Plan with any Committee and may, at any time, revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated. (ii) Rule 16b-3 Compliance. To the extent an Award is intended to qualify for the exemption from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act that is available under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, the Award will be granted by the Board or a Committee that consists solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors, as determined under Rule 16b-3(b)(3) of the Exchange Act, and thereafter any action establishing or modifying the terms of the Award will be approved by the Board or a Committee meeting such requirements to the extent necessary for such exemption to remain available. (d) Effect of Board s Decision. All determinations, interpretations and constructions made by the Board or any Committee in good faith will not be subject to review by any person and will be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. (e) Cancellation and Re-Grant of Awards. Except in connection with a Transaction, as provided in Section 6(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, or unless the stockholders of the Company have approved such an action within 12 months prior to such an event, neither the Board nor any Committee will have the authority to: (i) reduce the exercise or strike price of any outstanding Option or SAR; or (ii) cancel any outstanding Option or SAR that has an exercise or strike price greater than the then-current Fair Market Value in exchange for cash or other Awards under the Plan. 307473618 v2 15. (f) Delegation to an Officer. The Board or any Committee may delegate to one or more Officers the authority to do one or both of the following: (i) designate Employees who are not Officers to be recipients of Options and SARs (and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, other types of Awards) and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the terms thereof; and (ii) determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be subject to such Awards granted to such Employees; provided, however, that the resolutions or charter adopted by the Board or any Committee evidencing such delegation will specify the total number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject to the Awards granted by such Officer and that such Officer may not grant an Award to himself or herself. Any such Awards will be granted on the applicable form of Award Agreement most recently approved for use by the Board or the Committee, unless otherwise provided in the resolutions approving the delegation authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the Board nor any Committee may delegate to an Officer who is acting solely in the capacity of an Officer (and not also as a Director) the authority to determine the Fair Market Value. 8. TAX WITHHOLDING. (a) Withholding Authorization. As a condition to acceptance of any Award, a Participant authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to such Participant, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for, any sums required to satisfy any U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax or social insurance contribution withholding obligations of the Company or an Affiliate, if any, which arise in connection with the exercise, vesting or settlement of such Award, as applicable. Accordingly, a Participant may not be able to exercise an Award even though the Award is vested, and the Company will have no obligation to issue shares of Common Stock subject to an Award, unless and until such withholding obligations are satisfied. (b) Satisfaction of Withholding Obligations. To the extent permitted by the terms of an Award Agreement, the Company may, in its sole discretion, satisfy any U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax or social insurance contribution withholding obligations relating to an Award by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (i) causing the Participant to tender a cash payment; (ii) withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to the Participant in connection with the Award; (iii) withholding cash from an Award settled in cash; (iv) withholding payment from any amounts otherwise payable to the Participant; (v) by allowing a Participant to effectuate a cashless exercise pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board; or (vi) by such other method as may be set forth in the Award Agreement. (c) No Obligation to Notify or Minimize Taxes; No Liability to Claims. Except as required by Applicable Law, the Company has no duty or obligation to any Participant to advise such Participant as to the time or manner of exercising an Award. Furthermore, the Company has no duty or obligation to warn or otherwise advise such Participant of a pending termination or expiration of an Award or a possible period in which the Award may not be exercised. The Company has no duty or obligation to minimize the tax consequences of an Award to any Participant and will not be liable to any Participant for any adverse tax consequences to such Participant in connection with an Award. As a condition to accepting an Award, each Participant 307473618 v2 16. (i) agrees to not make any claim against the Company, or any of its Officers, Directors, Employees or Affiliates related to tax liabilities arising from such Award or other Company compensation and (ii) acknowledges that such Participant was advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, financial and other legal advisors regarding the tax consequences of the Award and has either done so or knowingly and voluntarily declined to do so. Additionally, each Participant acknowledges that any Option or SAR is exempt from Section 409A only if the exercise or strike price of such Option or SAR is at least equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant of such Option or SAR as determined by the Internal Revenue Service and there is no other impermissible deferral of compensation associated with the Award. Additionally, as a condition to accepting an Option or SAR, each Participant agrees to not make any claim against the Company, or any of its Officers, Directors, Employees or Affiliates in the event that the Internal Revenue Service asserts that the exercise or strike price of such Option or SAR is less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant of such Option or SAR as subsequently determined by the Internal Revenue Service. (d) Withholding Indemnification. As a condition to accepting an Award, in the event that the amount of the Company s and/or its Affiliate s withholding obligations in connection with such Award was greater than the amount actually withheld by the Company and/or its Affiliates, each Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company and/or its Affiliates harmless from any failure by the Company and/or its Affiliates to withhold the proper amount. 9. MISCELLANEOUS. (a) Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. Dividends or dividend equivalents may not be paid or credited to any Awards. (b) Source of Shares. The stock issuable under the Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock, including shares repurchased by the Company on the open market or otherwise. (c) Use of Proceeds from Sales of Common Stock. Proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Awards will constitute general funds of the Company. (d) Corporate Action Constituting Grant of Awards. Corporate action constituting a grant by the Company of an Award to any Participant will be deemed completed as of the date of such corporate action, unless otherwise determined by the Board, regardless of when the instrument, certificate, or letter evidencing the Award is communicated to, or actually received or accepted by, the Participant. In the event that the corporate records (e.g., Board consents, resolutions or minutes) documenting the corporate action approving the grant contain terms (e.g., exercise price, vesting schedule or number of shares) that are inconsistent with those in the Award Agreement or related grant documents as a result of a clerical error in the Award Agreement or related grant documents, the corporate records will control and the Participant will have no legally binding right to the incorrect term in the Award Agreement or related grant documents. 

307473618 v2 17. (e) Stockholder Rights. No Participant will be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares of Common Stock subject to an Award unless and until (i) such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of the Award pursuant to its terms, if applicable, and (ii) the issuance of the Common Stock subject to such Award is reflected in the records of the Company. (f) No Employment or Other Service Rights. Nothing in the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or in connection with any Award granted pursuant thereto will confer upon any Participant any right to continue to serve the Company or an Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Award was granted or affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate at will and without regard to any future vesting opportunity that a Participant may have with respect to any Award (i) the employment of an Employee with or without notice and with or without cause, (ii) the service of a Consultant pursuant to the terms of such Consultant s agreement with the Company or an Affiliate, or (iii) the service of a Director pursuant to the Bylaws of the Company or an Affiliate, and any applicable provisions of the corporate law of the state or foreign jurisdiction in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated, as the case may be. Further, nothing in the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or in connection with any Award will constitute any promise or commitment by the Company or an Affiliate regarding the fact or nature of future positions, future work assignments, future compensation or any other term or condition of employment or service or confer any right or benefit under the Award or the Plan unless such right or benefit has specifically accrued under the terms of the Award Agreement and/or Plan. (g) Change in Time Commitment. In the event a Participant s regular level of time commitment in the performance of his or her services for the Company or any Affiliate is reduced (for example, and without limitation, if the Participant is an Employee and has a change in status from a full-time Employee to a part-time Employee or takes an extended leave of absence) after the date of grant of any Award to the Participant, the Board may determine, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, to (i) make a corresponding reduction in the number of shares or cash amount subject to any portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date of such change in time commitment, and (ii) in lieu of or in combination with such a reduction, extend the vesting or payment schedule applicable to such Award. In the event of any such reduction, the Participant will have no right with respect to any portion of the Award that is so reduced or extended. (h) Execution of Additional Documents. As a condition to accepting an Award, the Participant agrees to execute any additional documents or instruments necessary or desirable, as determined in the Plan Administrator s sole discretion, to carry out the purposes or intent of the Award, or facilitate compliance with securities and/or other regulatory requirements, in each case at the Plan Administrator s request. (i) Electronic Delivery and Participation. Any reference herein or in an Award Agreement to a written agreement or document will include any agreement or document delivered electronically, filed publicly at www.sec.gov (or any successor website thereto) or posted on the Company s intranet (or other shared electronic medium controlled by the Company to which the Participant has access). By accepting any Award, the Participant consents to 307473618 v2 18. receive documents by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through any on-line electronic system established and maintained by the Plan Administrator or another third party selected by the Plan Administrator. The form of delivery of any Common Stock (e.g., a stock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) will be determined by the Company. (j) Clawback/Recovery. All Awards granted under the Plan will be subject to recoupment in accordance with the following, as applicable: (i) the Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. Policy for Recoupment of Incentive Compensation; (ii) the Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy; (iii) any clawback policy that the Company is required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the Company s securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or other Applicable Law; and (iv) any other clawback policy that the Company adopts. In addition, the Board may impose such other clawback, recovery or recoupment provisions in an Award Agreement as the Board determines necessary or appropriate, including but not limited to a reacquisition right in respect of previously acquired shares of Common Stock or other cash or property upon the occurrence of Cause. No recovery of compensation under such a clawback policy will be an event giving rise to a Participant s right to voluntary terminate employment upon a resignation for good reason, or for a constructive termination or any similar term under any plan of or agreement with the Company. (k) Securities Law Compliance. A Participant will not be issued any shares in respect of an Award unless either (i) the shares are registered under the Securities Act or (ii) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Each Award also must comply with other Applicable Law governing the Award, and a Participant will not receive such shares if the Company determines that such receipt would not be in material compliance with Applicable Law. (l) Transfer or Assignment of Awards; Issued Shares. Except as expressly provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement, Awards may not be transferred or assigned by the Participant. After the vested shares subject to an Award have been issued, or in the case of Restricted Stock and similar awards, after the issued shares have vested, the holder of such shares is free to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in such shares provided that any such actions are in compliance with the provisions herein, the terms of the Trading Policy and Applicable Law. (m) Effect on Other Employee Benefit Plans. The value of any Award, as determined upon grant, vesting or settlement, will not be included as compensation, earnings, salaries, or other similar terms used when calculating any Participant s benefits under any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company or any Affiliate, except as such plan otherwise expressly provides. The Company expressly reserves its rights to amend, modify, or terminate any of the Company s or any Affiliate s employee benefit plans. (n) Deferrals. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Board, in its sole discretion, may determine that the delivery of Common Stock or the payment of cash, upon the exercise, vesting or settlement of all or a portion of any Award may be deferred and may also 307473618 v2 19. establish programs and procedures for deferral elections to be made by Participants. Deferrals by will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A. (o) Section 409A. Unless otherwise expressly provided for in an Award Agreement, the Plan and each Award Agreement will be interpreted to the greatest extent possible in a manner that makes the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder exempt from Section 409A, and, to the extent not so exempt, in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A. If the Board determines that any Award granted hereunder is not exempt from and is therefore subject to Section 409A, the Award Agreement evidencing such Award will incorporate the terms and conditions necessary to avoid the consequences specified in Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code, and to the extent an Award Agreement is silent on terms necessary for compliance, such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into the Award Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan (and unless the Award Agreement specifically provides otherwise), if the shares of Common Stock are publicly traded, and if a Participant holding an Award that constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A is a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A, no distribution or payment of any amount that is due because of a separation from service (as defined in Section 409A without regard to alternative definitions thereunder) will be issued or paid before the date that is six months and one day following the date of such Participant s separation from service or, if earlier, the date of the Participant s death, unless such distribution or payment may be made in a manner that complies with Section 409A, and any amounts so deferred will be paid in a lump sum on the day after such six month period elapses, with the balance paid thereafter on the original schedule. (p) Choice of Law. This Plan and any controversy arising out of or relating to this Plan will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles that would result in any application of any law other than the law of the State of California. 10. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY. (a) Compliance with Law. The Company will seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency, as may be deemed to be necessary, having jurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to grant Awards and to issue and sell shares of Common Stock upon exercise or vesting of the Awards; provided, however, that this undertaking will not require the Company to register under the Securities Act the Plan, any Award or any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Award. If, after reasonable efforts and at a reasonable cost, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary or advisable for the lawful issuance and sale of Common Stock under the Plan, the Company will be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise or vesting of such Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. A Participant is not eligible for the grant of an Award or the subsequent issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the Award if such grant or issuance would be in violation of any Applicable Law. 307473618 v2 20. 11. ADDITIONAL RULES FOR AWARDS SUBJECT TO SECTION 409A. (a) Application. Unless the provisions of this Section 11 are expressly superseded by the provisions in an Award Agreement, the provisions of this Section 11 will apply and will supersede anything to the contrary set forth in the Award Agreement for a Non-Exempt Award. (b) Non-Exempt Awards Subject to Non-Exempt Severance Arrangements. To the extent a Non-Exempt Award is subject to Section 409A due to application of a Non-Exempt Severance Arrangement, the following provisions of this Section 11(b) will apply. (i) If the Non-Exempt Award vests in the ordinary course during the Participant s Continuous Service in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Award Agreement, and does not accelerate vesting under the terms of a Non-Exempt Severance Arrangement, in no event will the shares be issued in respect of such Non-Exempt Award any later than the later of: (i) December 31st of the calendar year that includes the applicable vesting date; (ii) the 60th day that follows the applicable vesting date; or (iii) any date that is permitted without incurring adverse tax consequences under Section 409A. (ii) If vesting of the Non-Exempt Award accelerates under the terms of a Non-Exempt Severance Arrangement in connection with the Participant s Separation from Service, and such vesting acceleration provisions were in effect as of the date of grant of the Non-Exempt Award and, therefore, are part of the terms of such Non-Exempt Award as of the date of grant, then the shares will be earlier issued in settlement of such Non-Exempt Award upon the Participant s Separation from Service in accordance with the terms of the Non-Exempt Severance Arrangement, but in no event later than the 60th day that follows the date of the Participant s Separation from Service. However, if at the time the shares would otherwise be issued the Participant is subject to the distribution limitations contained in Section 409A applicable to specified employees, as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such shares will not be issued before the date that is six months following the date of such Participant s Separation from Service, or, if earlier, the date of the Participant s death that occurs within such six month period. (iii) If vesting of a Non-Exempt Award accelerates under the terms of a Non- Exempt Severance Arrangement in connection with a Participant s Separation from Service, and such vesting acceleration provisions were not in effect as of the date of grant of the Non- Exempt Award and, therefore, are not a part of the terms of such Non-Exempt Award on the date of grant, then such acceleration of vesting of the Non-Exempt Award will not accelerate the issuance date of the shares, but the shares will instead be issued on the same schedule as set forth in the Grant Notice as if they had vested in the ordinary course during the Participant s Continuous Service, notwithstanding the vesting acceleration of the Non-Exempt Award. Such issuance schedule is intended to satisfy the requirements of payment on a specified date or pursuant to a fixed schedule, as provided under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(a)(4). (c) Treatment of Non-Exempt Awards Upon a Transaction for Employees and Consultants. The provisions of this Section 11(c) will apply and will supersede anything to the contrary set forth in the Plan with respect to the permitted treatment of any Non-Exempt Award 

307473618 v2 21. in connection with a Transaction if the Participant was either an Employee or Consultant upon the applicable date of grant of the Non-Exempt Award. (i) Vested Non-Exempt Awards. The following provisions will apply to any Vested Non-Exempt Award in connection with a Transaction: (1) If the Transaction is also a Section 409A Change in Control, then the Acquiring Entity may not assume, continue or substitute the Vested Non-Exempt Award. Upon the Section 409A Change in Control, the settlement of the Vested Non-Exempt Award will automatically be accelerated and the shares will be immediately issued in respect of the Vested Non-Exempt Award. Alternatively, the Company may instead provide that the Participant will receive a cash settlement equal to the Fair Market Value of the shares that would otherwise be issued to the Participant upon the Section 409A Change in Control. (2) If the Transaction is not also a Section 409A Change in Control, then the Acquiring Entity must either assume, continue or substitute each Vested Non-Exempt Award. The shares to be issued in respect of the Vested Non-Exempt Award will be issued to the Participant by the Acquiring Entity on the same schedule that the shares would have been issued to the Participant if the Transaction had not occurred. In the Acquiring Entity s discretion, in lieu of an issuance of shares, the Acquiring Entity may instead substitute a cash payment on each applicable issuance date, equal to the Fair Market Value of the shares that would otherwise be issued to the Participant on such issuance dates, with the determination of the Fair Market Value of the shares made on the date of the Transaction. (ii) Unvested Non-Exempt Awards. The following provisions will apply to any Unvested Non-Exempt Award unless otherwise determined by the Board pursuant to Section 11(e). (1) In the event of a Transaction, the Acquiring Entity will assume, continue or substitute any Unvested Non-Exempt Award. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, any Unvested Non-Exempt Award will remain subject to the same vesting and forfeiture restrictions that were applicable to the Award prior to the Transaction. The shares to be issued in respect of any Unvested Non-Exempt Award will be issued to the Participant by the Acquiring Entity on the same schedule that the shares would have been issued to the Participant if the Transaction had not occurred. In the Acquiring Entity s discretion, in lieu of an issuance of shares, the Acquiring Entity may instead substitute a cash payment on each applicable issuance date, equal to the Fair Market Value of the shares that would otherwise be issued to the Participant on such issuance dates, with the determination of Fair Market Value of the shares made on the date of the Transaction. (2) If the Acquiring Entity will not assume, substitute or continue any Unvested Non-Exempt Award in connection with a Transaction, then such Award will automatically terminate and be forfeited upon the Transaction with no consideration payable to any Participant in respect of such forfeited Unvested Non-Exempt Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted and in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A, the Board may in its discretion determine to elect to accelerate the vesting and settlement of the Unvested Non-Exempt Award upon the Transaction, or instead substitute a cash payment equal 307473618 v2 22. to the Fair Market Value of such shares that would otherwise be issued to the Participant, as further provided in Section 11(e)(ii). In the absence of such discretionary election by the Board, any Unvested Non-Exempt Award will be forfeited without payment of any consideration to the affected Participants if the Acquiring Entity will not assume, substitute or continue the Unvested Non-Exempt Awards in connection with the Transaction. (3) The foregoing treatment will apply with respect to all Unvested Non-Exempt Awards upon any Transaction, and regardless of whether or not such Transaction is also a Section 409A Change in Control. (d) Treatment of Non-Exempt Awards Upon a Transaction for Non-Employee Directors. The following provisions of this Section 11(d) will apply and will supersede anything to the contrary that may be set forth in the Plan with respect to the permitted treatment of a Non-Exempt Director Award in connection with a Transaction. (i) If the Transaction is also a Section 409A Change in Control, then the Acquiring Entity may not assume, continue or substitute the Non-Exempt Director Award. Upon the Section 409A Change in Control, the vesting and settlement of any Non-Exempt Director Award will automatically be accelerated and the shares will be immediately issued to the Participant in respect of the Non-Exempt Director Award. Alternatively, the Company may provide that the Participant will instead receive a cash settlement equal to the Fair Market Value of the shares that would otherwise be issued to the Participant upon the Section 409A Change in Control pursuant to the preceding provision. (ii) If the Transaction is not also a Section 409A Change in Control, then the Acquiring Entity must either assume, continue or substitute the Non-Exempt Director Award. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, the Non-Exempt Director Award will remain subject to the same vesting and forfeiture restrictions that were applicable to the Award prior to the Transaction. The shares to be issued in respect of the Non-Exempt Director Award will be issued to the Participant by the Acquiring Entity on the same schedule that the shares would have been issued to the Participant if the Transaction had not occurred. In the Acquiring Entity s discretion, in lieu of an issuance of shares, the Acquiring Entity may instead substitute a cash payment on each applicable issuance date, equal to the Fair Market Value of the shares that would otherwise be issued to the Participant on such issuance dates, with the determination of Fair Market Value made on the date of the Transaction. (e) If the RSU Award is a Non-Exempt Award, then the provisions in this Section 11(e) will apply and supersede anything to the contrary that may be set forth in the Plan or the Award Agreement with respect to the permitted treatment of such Non-Exempt Award: (i) Any exercise by the Board of discretion to accelerate the vesting of a Non-Exempt Award will not result in any acceleration of the scheduled issuance dates for the shares in respect of the Non-Exempt Award unless earlier issuance of the shares upon the applicable vesting dates would be in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A. (ii) The Company explicitly reserves the right to earlier settle any Non- Exempt Award to the extent permitted and in compliance with the requirements of Section 307473618 v2 23. 409A, including pursuant to any of the exemptions available in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix). (iii) To the extent the terms of any Non-Exempt Award provide that it will be settled upon a Transaction, to the extent it is required for compliance with the requirements of Section 409A, the Transaction event triggering settlement must also constitute a Section 409A Change in Control. To the extent the terms of a Non-Exempt Award provide that it will be settled upon a termination of employment or termination of Continuous Service, to the extent it is required for compliance with the requirements of Section 409A, the termination event triggering settlement must also constitute a Separation from Service. However, if at the time the shares would otherwise be issued to a Participant in connection with a separation from service such Participant is subject to the distribution limitations contained in Section 409A applicable to specified employees, as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such shares will not be issued before the date that is six months following the date of the Participant s Separation from Service, or, if earlier, the date of the Participant s death that occurs within such six month period. (iv) The provisions in this Section 11(e) for delivery of the shares in respect of the settlement of a RSU Award that is a Non-Exempt Award are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that the delivery of the shares to the Participant in respect of such Non-Exempt Award will not trigger the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be so interpreted. 12. SEVERABILITY. If all or any part of the Plan or any Award Agreement is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity will not invalidate any portion of the Plan or such Award Agreement not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any Section of the Plan or any Award Agreement (or part of such a Section) so declared to be unlawful or invalid will, if possible, be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such Section or part of a Section to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid. 13. TERMINATION OF THE PLAN. The Board may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Unless terminated sooner by the Board, the Plan will automatically terminate on the day before the tenth anniversary of the earlier of: (i) the Adoption Date; or (ii) the Effective Date. No Awards may be granted under the Plan while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. 307473618 v2 24. 14. DEFINITIONS. As used in the Plan, the following definitions apply to the capitalized terms indicated below: (a) Acquiring Entity means the surviving or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquiring corporation s parent company) in connection with a Transaction. (b) Adoption Date means the date the Plan is first approved by the Compensation Committee. (c) Affiliate means, at the time of determination, any parent or subsidiary of the Company as such terms are defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act. The Board may determine the time or times at which parent or subsidiary status is determined within the foregoing definition.

(the Company has granted you an option under its 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan to purchase the number of shares of the Company s Common Stock indicated in your Grant Notice at the exercise price indicated in your Grant Notice. Defined terms not explicitly defined in this Option Agreement but defined in the Plan shall have the same definitions as in the Plan. The details of your option are as follows: 1. VESTING. (a) Subject to the limitations contained herein, your option will vest as provided in your Grant Notice, provided that vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except as otherwise explicitly otherwise provided herein. (b) [For Employees and Directors, in the event of your termination of Continuous Service due to your death or Disability, as of such date your option will vest in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in your Grant Notice as if you had provided an additional six (6) months of Continuous Service as of the date of your termination.] (c) [For Directors, in the event of a Corporate Transaction during your Continuous Service, your option will immediately fully vest.] (d) [For Employees, in the event of the Company s involuntary termination of your Continuous Service without Cause upon or within the twelve (12) month period following a Corporate Transaction, your option will immediately fully vest.] 2. NUMBER OF SHARES AND EXERCISE PRICE. The number of shares of Common Stock subject to your option and your exercise price per share referenced in your Grant Notice may be adjusted from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments. 3. EXERCISE RESTRICTION FOR NON-EXEMPT EMPLOYEES. In the event that you are an Employee eligible for overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (i.e., a Non-Exempt Employee ), you may not exercise your option until you have completed at least six (6) months of Continuous Service measured from the Date of Grant specified in your Grant Notice, notwithstanding any other provision of your option. 4. METHOD OF PAYMENT. Payment of the exercise price is due in full upon exercise of all or any part of your option. You may elect to make payment of the exercise price in cash or by check or in any other manner permitted by your Grant Notice, which may include one or more of the following: 307480254 v2 (a) Provided that at the time of exercise the Common Stock is publicly traded and quoted regularly in The Wall Street Journal, pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that, prior to the issuance of Common Stock, results in either the receipt of cash (or check) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds. (b) Provided that at the time of exercise the Common Stock is publicly traded and quoted regularly in The Wall Street Journal, by delivery to the Company (either by actual delivery or attestation) of already-owned shares of Common Stock that are owned free and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances or security interests, and that are valued at Fair Market Value on the date of exercise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may not exercise your option by tender to the Company of Common Stock to the extent such tender would violate the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company s stock. (c) Subject to approval by the Company and/or the Board, as applicable, at or prior to the time of exercise, if your option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option, by a net exercise arrangement, as provided in Section 5(c)(iv) of the Plan. 5. WHOLE SHARES. You may exercise your option only for whole shares of Common Stock. 6. SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, you may not exercise your option unless the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise are then registered under the Securities Act or, if such shares of Common Stock are not then so registered, the Company has determined that such exercise and issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The exercise of your option also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing your option, and you may not exercise your option if the Company determines that such exercise would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations. 7. TERM. You may not exercise your option before the commencement of its term or after its term expires. The term of your option commences on the Date of Grant and expires upon the earliest of the following: (a) immediately upon the termination of your Continuous Service for Cause; (b) [for an Employee, three (3) months after the termination of your Continuous Service for any reason other than Cause, Disability or death, provided that if during any part of such three (3)-month period you may not exercise your option solely because of the condition set forth in the preceding paragraph relating to Securities Law Compliance, your option shall not expire until the earlier of the Expiration Date or until it shall have been exercisable for an aggregate period of three (3) months after the termination of your Continuous Service;] (c) [for a Director, three (3) years after the termination of your Continuous Service for any reason other than Cause;] (d) [for a Consultant, thirty (30) days after the termination of your Continuous Service for any reason other than Cause, provided that if during any part of such thirty (30)-day period you may not exercise your option solely because of the condition set forth in the preceding paragraph 

307480254 v2 relating to Securities Law Compliance, your option shall not expire until the earlier of the Expiration Date or until it shall have been exercisable for an aggregate period of thirty (30) days after the termination of your Continuous Service;] (e) [for an Employee, twelve (12) months after the termination of your Continuous Service due to your Disability;] (f) [for an Employee, eighteen (18) months after your death if you die during your Continuous Service;] (g) the Expiration Date indicated in your Grant Notice; or (h) the day before the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Date of Grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you die during the period provided in Section 8(b) above, the term of your option shall not expire until the earlier of eighteen (18) months after your termination of your Continuous Service, the Expiration Date indicated in your Grant Notice, or the day before the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Date of Grant. If your option is an Incentive Stock Option, note that, to obtain the federal income tax advantages associated with an Incentive Stock Option, the Code requires that at all times beginning on the date of grant of your option and ending on the day three (3) months before the date of your option s exercise, you must be an employee of the Company or an Affiliate, except in the event of your death or Disability. The Company has provided for extended exercisability of your option under certain circumstances for your benefit but cannot guarantee that your option will necessarily be treated as an Incentive Stock Option if you continue to provide services to the Company or an Affiliate as a Consultant or Director after your employment terminates or if you otherwise exercise your option more than three (3) months after the date your employment terminates. 8. EXERCISE. (a) You may exercise the vested portion of your option (and the unvested portion of your option if your Grant Notice so permits) during its term by delivering a Notice of Exercise (in a form designated by the Company) together with the exercise price to the Secretary of the Company, or to such other person as the Company may designate, during regular business hours, together with such additional documents as the Company may then require. (b) By exercising your option you agree that, as a condition to any exercise of your option, the Company may require you to enter into an arrangement providing for the payment by you to the Company of any tax withholding obligation of the Company arising by reason of (1) the exercise of your option, or (2) the disposition of shares of Common Stock acquired upon such exercise. (c) If your option is an Incentive Stock Option, by exercising your option you agree that you will notify the Company in writing within fifteen (15) days after the date of any disposition of any of the shares of the Common Stock issued upon exercise of your option that occurs within 307480254 v2 two (2) years after the date of your option grant or within one (1) year after such shares of Common Stock are transferred upon exercise of your option. 9. TRANSFERABILITY. Your option is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable during your life only by you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, you may designate a third party who, in the event of your death, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise your option. In addition, if permitted by the Company you may transfer your option to a trust if you are considered to be the sole beneficial owner (determined under Section 671 of the Code and applicable state law) while the option is held in the trust, provided that you and the trustee enter into a transfer and other agreements required by the Company. 10. OPTION NOT A SERVICE CONTRACT. Your option is not an employment or service contract, and nothing in your option shall be deemed to create in any way whatsoever any obligation on your part to continue in the employ of the Company or an Affiliate, or of the Company or an Affiliate to continue your employment. In addition, nothing in your option shall obligate the Company or an Affiliate, their respective stockholders, Boards of Directors, Officers or Employees to continue any relationship that you might have as a Director or Consultant for the Company or an Affiliate. 11. WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS. (a) At the time you exercise your option, in whole or in part, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, you hereby authorize withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to you, and otherwise agree to make adequate provision for (including by means of a cashless exercise pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board to the extent permitted by the Company), any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Company or an Affiliate, if any, which arise in connection with the exercise of your option. (b) Upon your request and subject to approval by the Company, in its sole discretion, and compliance with any applicable legal conditions or restrictions, the Company may withhold from fully vested shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to you upon the exercise of your option a number of whole shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value, determined by the Company as of the date of exercise, not in excess of the maximum amount of tax required to be withheld by law (or such other amount as may be permitted while still avoiding classification of your option as a liability for financial accounting purposes). (c) You may not exercise your option unless the tax withholding obligations of the Company and/or any Affiliate are satisfied. Accordingly, you may not be able to exercise your option when desired even though your option is vested, and the Company shall have no obligation to issue a certificate for such shares of Common Stock or release such shares of Common Stock from any escrow provided for herein unless such obligations are satisfied. 12. NOTICES. Any notices provided for in your option or the Plan shall be given in writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon receipt or, in the case of notices delivered by mail by 307480254 v2 the Company to you, five (5) days after deposit in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to you at the last address you provided to the Company. 13. GOVERNING PLAN DOCUMENT. Your option is subject to all the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of which are hereby made a part of your option, and is further subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations, which may from time to time be promulgated and adopted pursuant to the Plan. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of your option and those of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall control.
