 million Australian dollars to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar operating expenditures over the nine-month period ending June 30, 2025. The instruments entitle the Company to receive payment on the notional amount should the quarterly average Australian dollar-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate exceed amounts ranging from to over the nine-month period ending June 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company also held purchased collars with an aggregate notional amount of million Australian dollars related to anticipated Australian dollar operating expenditures during the nine-month period ending June 30, 2025. The purchased collars have a floor and ceiling of approximately and , respectively, whereby the Company will incur a loss on the instruments for rates below the floor and a gain for rates above the ceiling. 
 Derivative Contracts Related to Forecasted Sales 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had coal derivative contracts related to its forecasted sales. Historically, such financial contracts have included futures and forwards. 
 Financial Trading Contracts 
 On a limited basis, the Company may enter coal or freight derivative contracts for trading purposes. Such financial contracts may include futures, forwards and options. The Company held nominal financial trading contracts as of September 30, 2024. 
 Tabular Derivatives Disclosures 
 The Company has master netting agreements with certain of its counterparties which allow for the settlement of contracts in an asset position with contracts in a liability position in the event of default or termination. Such netting arrangements reduce the Company s credit exposure related to these counterparties. For classification purposes, the Company records the net fair value of all the positions with a given counterparty as a net asset or liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had asset derivatives comprised of foreign currency option contracts with a fair value of million and million, respectively.

 The Company classifies the cash effects of its derivatives within the Cash Flows From Operating Activities section of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company uses a three-level fair value hierarchy that categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on the observability of the inputs utilized in the valuation. These levels include: Level 1 - inputs are quoted prices in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 - inputs are other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable through market-corroborated inputs; and Level 3 - inputs are unobservable, or observable but cannot be market-corroborated, requiring the Company to make assumptions about pricing by market participants.

 Equity securities Total net assets December 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (Dollars in millions) Foreign currency option contracts Equity securities Total net assets 
 For Level 1 and 2 financial assets and liabilities, the Company utilizes both direct and indirect observable price quotes, including interest rate yield curves, exchange indices, broker/dealer quotes, published indices, issuer spreads, benchmark securities and other market quotes. In the case of certain debt securities, fair value is provided by a third-party pricing service. Below is a summary of the Company s valuation techniques for Level 1 and 2 financial assets and liabilities: 
 Foreign currency option contracts are valued utilizing inputs obtained in quoted public markets (Level 2) except when credit and non-performance risk is considered to be a significant input, then the Company classifies such contracts as Level 3. 
 Derivative contracts related to forecasted sales and financial trading contracts are generally valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) or a valuation that is corroborated by the use of market-based pricing (Level 2) except when credit and non-performance risk is considered to be a significant input (greater than of fair value), then the Company classifies as Level 3. 
 Investments in equity securities are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (Level 1). 
 Other Financial Instruments . The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values for other financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, including those within the Company s accounts receivable securitization program, margining cash, notes receivable and accounts payable have carrying values which approximate fair value due to the short maturity or the liquid nature of these instruments. 
 Long-term debt fair value estimates are based on observed prices for securities when available (Level 2), and otherwise on estimated borrowing rates to discount the cash flows to their present value (Level 3). 
 Market risk associated with the Company s fixed-rate long-term debt relates to the potential reduction in the fair value from an increase in interest rates. 
 Less: Unamortized debt issuance costs ) ) Net carrying amount Estimated fair value 
 The Company s risk management function, which is independent of the Company s coal trading function, is responsible for valuation policies and procedures, with oversight from executive management. The fair value of the Company s coal derivative assets and liabilities reflects adjustments for credit risk. The Company s exposure to credit risk is substantially with electric utilities, energy marketers, steel producers and nonfinancial trading houses.

 million. The 2028 Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are governed under an indenture. 
 The Company used the proceeds of the offering of the 2028 Convertible Notes and available cash to redeem its then-existing senior secured notes, and to pay related premiums, fees and expenses relating to the offering and redemptions. The Company capitalized million of debt issuance costs related to the offering, which are being amortized over the terms of the notes. 
 The 2028 Convertible Notes will mature on March 1, 2028, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The 2028 Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. 
 The initial conversion rate for the 2028 Convertible Notes was shares of the Company s common stock per principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes, which represented an initial conversion price of approximately per share of the Company s common stock. The terms of the indenture require conversion rate adjustments upon the payment of dividends to holders of the Company s common stock once such cumulative dividends impact the conversion rate by at least . Effective February 21, 2024, the conversion rate was increased to shares of the Company s common stock per principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes, which represented an adjusted conversion price of approximately per share. Under the applicable conversion rate formula, the cumulative per share dividends declared and paid during the six months ended September 30, 2024 yielded a revised conversion rate of shares per principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes, which did not meet the threshold to impact the existing conversion rate of . The conversion rate may be impacted prospectively, based upon cumulative dividends paid. The conversion rate is also subject to further adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the indenture. 
 During the first three quarters of 2024, the Company s reported common stock prices did not prompt the conversion feature of the 2028 Convertible Notes. As a result, the 2028 Convertible Notes were not convertible at the option of the holders during the second or third quarters of 2024, and will not be similarly convertible during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the if-converted value of the 2028 Convertible Notes exceeded the principal amount by million. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 The Company established a new revolving credit facility with a maximum aggregate principal amount of million in revolving commitments by entering into a credit agreement, dated as of January 18, 2024 (the 2024 Credit Agreement), by and among the Company, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto. The Company paid aggregate debt issuance costs of million. 
 The revolving commitments and any related loans, if applicable (any such loans, the Revolving Loans), established by the 2024 Credit Agreement terminate or mature, as applicable, on January 18, 2028, subject to certain conditions relating to the Company s outstanding 2028 Convertible Notes. The Revolving Loans bear interest at a secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus an applicable margin ranging from to , depending on the Company s total net leverage ratio (as defined under the 2024 Credit Agreement) or a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to , at the Company s option. Letters of credit issued under the 2024 Credit Agreement incur a combined fee equal to an applicable margin ranging from to plus a fronting fee equal to per annum. Unused capacity under the 2024 Credit Agreement bears a commitment fee of per annum. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the 2024 Credit Agreement had only been utilized for letters of credit, including million outstanding as of September 30, 2024. These letters of credit support the Company s reclamation bonding requirements, lease obligations, insurance policies and various other performance guarantees as further described in Note 12. Financial Instruments and Other Guarantees. Availability under the 2024 Credit Agreement was million at September 30, 2024.

 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 because to do so would have been anti-dilutive for those periods. Because the potential dilutive impact of such share-based compensation awards is calculated under the treasury stock method, anti-dilution generally occurs when the exercise prices or unrecognized compensation cost per share of such awards are higher than the Company s average stock price during the applicable period. Anti-dilution also occurs when a company reports a net loss from continuing operations, and the dilutive impact of all share-based compensation awards are excluded accordingly.

 Surety Agreement Amendment and Collateral Requirements 
 In April 2023, the Company amended its existing agreement with the providers of its surety bond portfolio, dated November 6, 2020. Under the April 2023 amendment, the Company and its surety providers agreed to a maximum aggregate collateral amount of million based upon bonding levels at the effective date of the amendment. This maximum collateral amount will vary prospectively as bonding levels increase or decrease. The amendment extended the agreement through December 31, 2026. In order to maintain the maximum collateral agreement, the Company must remain compliant with a minimum liquidity test and a maximum net leverage ratio, as measured each quarter. The minimum liquidity test requires the Company to maintain liquidity at the greater of million or the difference between the penal sum of all surety bonds and the amount of collateral posted in favor of surety providers, which was million at September 30, 2024. The Company must also maintain a maximum net leverage ratio of to , where the numerator consists of its funded debt, net of cash, and the denominator consists of its Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months. For purposes of calculating the ratio, only of the outstanding principal amount of the Company s 2028 Convertible Notes is deemed to be funded debt. The Company s ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases is also subject to the quarterly minimum liquidity test. The Company is in compliance with such requirements at September 30, 2024. 
 To fund the maximum collateral amount, the Company deposited million into trust accounts for the benefit of certain surety providers on March 31, 2023. The remainder was comprised of million of existing cash-collateralized letters of credit and million already held on behalf of a surety provider. The amendment became effective on April 14, 2023, when the Company terminated a then-existing credit agreement which, as amended, provided for million of capacity for irrevocable standby letters of credit (LC Facility). 
 LC Facility 
 The now-terminated LC Facility had an original capacity of million and was subsequently amended at various dates to reduce its capacity and effect certain other changes, including in February 2023 to reduce capacity by million, accelerate the expiration date to December 31, 2023 from December 31, 2024, and eliminate the prepayment premium due upon any reduction of commitments thereunder prior to July 29, 2023. The Company recorded early debt extinguishment losses of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the February 2023 amendment and subsequent termination. 
 Prior to its termination, undrawn letters of credit under the LC Facility bore interest at per annum and unused commitments were subject to a per annum commitment fee.

 Credit Support Facilities 
 In February 2022, the Company entered into an agreement which provides up to million of capacity for irrevocable standby letters of credit, primarily to support reclamation bonding requirements. The agreement requires the Company to provide cash collateral at a level of of the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding under the arrangement (limited to million total excess collateralization). Outstanding letters of credit bear a fixed fee in the amount of per annum. The Company receives a variable deposit rate on the amount of cash collateral posted in support of letters of credit. The agreement has an initial expiration date of December 31, 2025. At September 30, 2024, letters of credit of million were outstanding under the agreement, which were collateralized by cash of million. 
 In December 2023, the Company established cash-backed bank guarantee facilities, primarily to support Australian reclamation bonding requirements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company capitalized million of debt issuance costs related to these bank guarantee facilities. The Company receives a variable deposit rate on the amount of cash collateral posted in support of the bank guarantee facilities, which mature at various dates between 2026 and 2029.

Overview 
 Peabody is a leading producer of metallurgical and thermal coal. In 2023, the Company produced and sold 126.7 million and 126.2 million tons of coal, respectively, from continuing operations. At September 30, 2024, the Company owned interests in 17 active coal mining operations located in the United States (U.S.) and Australia. Included in that count is Peabody s 50 equity interest in Middlemount Coal Pty Ltd (Middlemount), which owns the Middlemount Mine in Queensland, Australia. In addition to its mining operations, the Company markets and brokers coal from other coal producers; trades coal and freight-related contracts; and since 2022, is partnered in a joint venture with the intent of developing various sites, including certain reclaimed mining land held by the Company in the U.S., for utility-scale photovoltaic solar generation and battery storage. 
 The Company reports its results of operations primarily through the following reportable segments: Seaborne Thermal, Seaborne Metallurgical, Powder River Basin, Other U.S. Thermal and Corporate and Other. Refer to Note 14. Segment Information to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding those segments and the components of its Corporate and Other segment. 
 Spot pricing for premium low-vol hard coking coal (Premium HCC), premium low-vol pulverized coal injection (Premium PCI) coal, Newcastle index thermal coal and API 5 index thermal coal, and prompt month pricing for PRB 8,880 Btu/Lb coal and Illinois Basin 11,500 Btu/Lb coal during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is set forth in the table below. 
 The seaborne pricing included in the table below is not necessarily indicative of the pricing the Company realized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to quality differentials and a portion of its seaborne sales being executed through annual and multi-year international coal supply agreements that contain provisions requiring both parties to renegotiate pricing periodically, with spot, index and quarterly sales arrangements also utilized. The Company s typical practice is to negotiate pricing for seaborne metallurgical coal contracts on a quarterly, spot or index basis and seaborne thermal coal contracts on an annual, spot or index basis. 
 In the U.S., the pricing included in the table below is also not necessarily indicative of the pricing the Company realized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 since the Company generally sells coal under long-term contracts where pricing is determined based on various factors. Such long-term contracts in the U.S. may vary significantly in many respects, including price adjustment features, price reopener terms, coal quality requirements, quantity parameters, permitted sources of supply, treatment of environmental constraints, extension options, force majeure and termination and assignment provisions. Competition from alternative fuels such as natural gas and other fuel sources may also impact the Company s realized pricing.

Table of Contents 

Within the seaborne metallurgical coal market, coking coal prices have retreated from a high base during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Parts of the global steel market have reported tepid demand and thin profit margins during this period, restricting demand growth for metallurgical coal. In China, continued weakness in the property sector has contributed to lower domestic steel demand and steel production in 2024 and has also supported increased steel exports. The increased availability of competitively priced Chinese imports has pressured steel margins for steel producers in other countries, although India has recorded year-over-year production growth due to its increased domestic consumption. Meanwhile, global supply of coking coal has been relatively stable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and has met global demand despite various disruption events, such as a fire at the Grosvenor Mine in Australia and shipping interruptions at the U.S. s Baltimore, Maryland port. In the PCI segment, prices were initially under pressure early in the year with a wide discount to coking coal caused in part by reduced steel making productivity targets under thin margin conditions. PCI relativities to coking coal have since improved. In September 2024, increased government stimulus activity in China has supported an uptick in Chinese ferrous futures prices, which has in turn contributed to improved spot pricing for seaborne metallurgical coal. In the coming period, seasonal restocking patterns and ongoing economic stimulus may lend support to metallurgical coal pricing. Overall, the market for metallurgical coal remains finely balanced and exposed to volatility, influenced by the rate of exports from Australia and economic performance in China, India and elsewhere. 
 Within the seaborne thermal coal market, global thermal coal prices continued to remain stable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven by healthy supply meeting elevated demand in Asian markets. In China, overall total generation demand has been elevated while domestic coal production has remained relatively flat, which has driven stronger coal import demand year-over-year through the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In India, strong growth in coal generation has supported increased import demand, despite elevated domestic coal production. Looking ahead, global thermal coal markets remain turbulent amid tighter supply ahead of winter restocking requirements in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as volatile global natural gas markets. 
 In the U.S., overall electricity demand increased approximately 3 year-over-year. Through the nine months ended September 30, 2024, electricity generation from thermal coal has decreased year-over-year driven by continued low natural gas prices and stronger renewable generation. Coal s share of electricity generation has declined to approximately 15 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while wind and solar s combined generation share is at 17 and the share of natural gas generation has remained level at 43 . U.S. coal inventories have declined through September 30, 2024, resulting in stockpiles declining more than 10 million tons below levels seen at the end of 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, utility consumption of PRB coal has declined compared to the prior year period. 
 Centurion Mine 
 Peabody s redevelopment of the Centurion Mine, an underground longwall metallurgical coal mine in Queensland, Australia, continues to advance as planned. Through September 30, 2024, two continuous miners units have been commissioned, the first development coal was produced and the first coal was washed. The first coal shipment from the Centurion Mine is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024, and the Company is targeting the commencement of longwall production in the first quarter of 2026. Approximately 250 million of the 489 million of capital expenditures to reach longwall production has been completed as of September 30, 2024. 
 Other 
 Wards Well Acquisition. The Company entered into a definitive agreement dated October 26, 2023, to acquire the southern part of the Wards Well tenements (Wards Well) which are adjacent to the Company s Centurion Mine in Queensland, Australia. The acquisition was completed on April 16, 2024 for total consideration of 153.4 million, consisting of cash consideration of 134.4 million, cash transaction costs of 9.4 million and the non-cash settlement of existing receivables with the acquiree of 9.6 million. 
 The agreement also includes an initial contingent royalty of up to 200 million. The royalty will only be payable once the Company has recovered its investment and development costs of Wards Well and if the average sales price achieved exceeds certain thresholds. No royalty is payable if the Company does not commence mining Wards Well. 
 Shoal Creek Insurance Recovery. On March 29, 2023, the Company s Shoal Creek Mine experienced a fire involving void fill material utilized to stabilize the roof structure of the mine. On June 20, 2023, the Company announced that the Shoal Creek Mine, in coordination with the Mine Safety and Health Administration, had safely completed localized sealing of the affected area of the mine.

 Results of Operations 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Summary 
 The decrease in income from continuing operations, net of income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year 16.3 million) was driven by higher operating costs and expenses 42.1 million), partially offset by a lower year-over-year provision for taxes 20.8 million) and higher revenue 9.1 million) due to higher seaborne thermal coal pricing. 
 The decrease in income from continuing operations, net of income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year 248.0 million) was driven by lower revenue 598.1 million) due to no unrealized mark-to-market gains from derivative contracts related to forecasted sales in the current year, lower seaborne coal pricing and volume decreases in the U.S. thermal segments. This unfavorable variance was partially offset by a lower tax provision 153.5 million), the current year insurance recovery related to the 2023 event at the Shoal Creek Mine 109.5 million), lower operating costs and expenses 48.4 million) and a lower year-over-year provision for losses at the NARM and Shoal Creek Mines 33.3 million). 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected year-over-year decreases of 45.2 million and 323.8 million, respectively.

The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review national ambient air quality standards every five years to determine whether revisions to current standards are appropriate. On March 6, 2024, the EPA revised the level of the primary standard for fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), lowering the annual standard from 12.0 ug /m 3 to 9.0 ug /m 3 . States are now required to take several actions to implement the standards which could require fossil fuel electric generating units (EGUs) and non-EGUs to install additional emission control technologies or operate in a different manner. Such actions could potentially increase the cost of utilizing fossil fuels for electric generation and industrial uses. 
 The EPA is also in the process of reviewing the current ozone NAAQS. The level of the ozone NAAQS can also affect requirements to install new or improved emission control technologies at fossil fuel-fired EGUs and non-EGU industrial sources. 
 Final New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for Fossil Fuel-Fired EGUs . The EPA promulgated a final rule to limit carbon dioxide (CO 2 from new, modified and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired EGUs under Section 111(b) of the CAA on August 3, 2015, and published it in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015. 
 The rule requires that newly-constructed fossil fuel-fired steam generating units achieve an emission standard for CO 2 (known as the Best System of Emission Reduction (BSER)) which is based on the performance of a supercritical pulverized coal boiler implementing partial carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). Modified and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired steam generating units must implement the most efficient generation achievable through a combination of best operating practices and equipment upgrades, to meet an emission standard consistent with best historical performance. Reconstructed EGUs must implement the most efficient generating technology based on the size of the unit. 
 Numerous legal challenges to the final rule were filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit). Sixteen separate petitions for review were filed, and the challengers include 25 states, utilities, mining companies (including Peabody), labor unions, trade organizations and other groups. The cases were consolidated under the case filed by North Dakota (D.C. Cir. No. 15-1381). Four additional cases were filed seeking review of the EPA s denial of reconsideration petitions in a final action published in the May 6, 2016 Federal Register entitled Reconsideration of Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Generating Units; Notice of final action denying petitions for reconsideration. Pursuant to an order of the court, these cases remain in abeyance, subject to requirements for the EPA to file 90-day status reports. 
 On December 20, 2018, the EPA proposed to revise the 2015 NSPS to modify the minimum requirements for newly constructed coal-fired units from partial CCUS to efficiency-based standards. (83 Fed. Reg. 65,424 (Dec. 20, 2018)). In contrast to the 2015 rule, the proposed rule defined BSER as the most efficient demonstrated steam cycle in combination with the best operating practices. The EPA indicated that the primary reason for revising BSER was the high cost and limited geographic availability of CCUS technology. On May 23, 2023, however, the EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing NSPS from new, modified and reconstructed fossil-fuel steam EGUs. In contrast to the 2018 proposed rule, the 2023 proposed rule did not propose to amend the 2015 NSPS for coal-fired EGUs. Status reports filed with the D.C. Circuit in North Dakota v. EPA indicate that litigation on the 2015 rule should remain in abeyance pending the EPA s action on the 2018 proposed rule and the 2023 proposed rule. As indicated in the following section, on May 9, 2024, the EPA published the final rule in the Federal Register based on the 2023 proposed rule. This final rule did not amend the 2015 NSPS for coal-fired EGUs, but indicated that the EPA will continue to consider whether or not to make revisions to that rule in the future. 
 EPA Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New and Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired EGUs . On May 9, 2024, the EPA published a final rule for new, modified and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired EGUs in the Federal Register. The final rule consists of four elements: (1) revised NSPS for controlling CO 2 emissions from new and reconstructed stationary combustion turbines; (2) revised NSPS for fossil fuel-fired steam EGUs that undertake a large modification; (3) emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel-fired steam EGUs; and (4) repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy rule promulgated in 2019.

With respect to existing fossil fuel-fired steam EGUs (primarily coal-fired) the EPA determined that the BSER that is adequately demonstrated is carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) with 90 capture of CO 2 emissions. Pursuant to the final rule, existing fossil fuel-fired steam EGUs that intend to operate in the long-term will be required to comply with a CO 2 emission rate based on CCS with 90 capture by January 1, 2032. Existing fossil fuel-fired steam EGUs that will permanently cease operations by January 1, 2039 are not subject to emission standards based on 90 CO 2 capture, but will need to meet an emission rate based on co-firing with 40 natural gas by January 1, 2030. (This translates into a 16 reduction in CO 2 emissions determined from a unit-specific baseline). Existing fossil fuel-fired steam EGUs that permanently cease operations by January 1, 2032 are exempt from these requirements. 
 All requirements related to existing affected units in the final rule whether fired by coal or natural gas will be imposed through state plans that are permitted to take into account the remaining useful life of a generating unit when determining appropriate controls. Under the final rule, such plans must provide for the implementation and enforcement of the NSPS, but states may apply less stringent standards of performance in certain conditions, as specified in EPA regulations. States are also permitted to impose more stringent standards. In addition, the final rule includes several reliability mechanisms to allow states to provide alternative emission limitations or compliance date extensions in order to maintain adequate electric generation resources and grid reliability. 
 Finally, as part of the final rule, any newly constructed stationary combustion turbine (SCT), where construction or reconstruction of the unit was commenced after May 23, 2023, will be subject to CO 2 emission limits based on whether it is considered to be a low load, intermediate load or base load EGU. In addition, for affected base load SCTs, a second phase emission standard applies based on 90 CCS as of January 1, 2032. Any new fossil-fuel steam EGU (where construction or reconstruction was commenced after June 18, 2014) will need to comply with standards promulgated in 2015. 
 The final rule is subject to numerous legal challenges that have been consolidated in the D.C. Circuit. Petitioners filed an emergency application for a stay of the rule with the U.S. Supreme Court which was denied in an order issued by the U.S. Supreme Court on October 16, 2024. In a statement respecting this denial, Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch expressed the view that the petitioners have shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits as to at least some of their challenges but because efforts to comply would not need to be initiated until June 2025, they would be unlikely to suffer irreparable harm before the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit decides the merits of the pending litigation. Justice Thomas would have granted the application for a stay; the views of other Justices regarding the merits of the litigation are unknown. If the rule is ultimately affirmed and implemented by the EPA and states, it could have a substantial impact on the use of coal and natural gas for the generation of electricity. 
 Effluent Limitations Guidelines for the Steam Electric Power Generating Industry. In 2015, the EPA published a final rule setting requirements for wastewater discharge from EGUs. In 2020, the EPA finalized revisions to certain requirements in the 2015 rule. On May 9, 2024, the EPA published a final rule that would establish more stringent standards for flue gas desulfurization wastewater, bottom ash transport water, combustion residual leachate and legacy wastewater discharged from certain surface impoundments. The final revised effluent limitations guidelines would significantly increase costs for many coal-fueled steam electric power plants. In addition, the recently finalized final rule allows EGUs that commit to ceasing coal combustion by December 31, 2034, to comply with less stringent wastewater discharge requirements during the interim. The final rule is subject to numerous legal challenges that have been consolidated in the Eighth Circuit. If the Eighth Circuit affirms the final rule, it could influence fuel switching or additional coal generating unit retirements by the end of 2034. 
 Rules for Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) from Electric Utilities; Federal CCR Permit Program and Revisions to Closure Requirements. On February 20, 2020, as required by the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, the EPA proposed a federal permitting program for the disposal of CCR in surface impoundments and landfills. Under the proposal, the EPA would directly implement the permit program in Indian Country and at CCR units located in states that have not submitted their own CCR permit program for approval. The proposal includes requirements for federal CCR permit applications, content and modification, as well as procedural requirements. The comment period for the EPA s proposal ended on April 20, 2020. Although the EPA had planned to finalize this rule in 2021, the EPA now expects to issue a final rule around October 2024. Separately, on August 28, 2020 and November 12, 2020, the EPA finalized two sets of amendments to its 2015 CCR rule to partially address the D.C. Circuit s 2018 decision holding that certain provisions of that rule were not sufficiently protective. On May 8, 2024, the EPA published a final rule containing additional amendments to the 2015 CCR rule that further address aspects of the D.C. Circuit s 2018 decision. Finally, the EPA is still considering whether to finalize additional revisions to the 2015 CCR Rule related to closure of CCR units. 
 Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and CSAPR Update Rule . The CSAPR and related updates require numerous U.S. states and the District of Columbia to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines and significantly contribute to ozone and/or fine PM pollution in other states.

On March 15, 2023, the EPA issued a final rule to address regional ozone transport by imposing new federal ozone season emission budgets for nitrogen oxide (NO x in 23 states, including California, Nevada, Oklahoma and Texas, as well as some Indian reservations. The rule includes state emission budgets for NO x affecting fossil fuel-fired power plants and a backstop daily emissions rate for large coal-fired power plants if they exceed specified limits. The rule also sets first-time limits on certain industrial sources that will apply starting with the 2026 ozone season in 20 states. The EPA estimates that annual compliance costs (for 2023 through 2042) will be 770 million to 910 million. These emission limitations would apply in addition to requirements contained in state implementation plans to control ozone precursors in affected states, although states have the option to replace these limits with equally strict or more stringent limitations. When implemented, this rule could influence the closure of some coal generating units that have not installed selective catalytic reduction technologies. 
 Implementation of the rule for existing sources (accomplished through state implementation plans) was challenged in several U.S. Courts of Appeal, resulting in different court opinions and in requirements being implemented in some states, but stayed in others. On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the rule in 11 states pending the disposition of a petition for review of the rule in the D.C. Circuit and any subsequent timely petition for certiorari filed with and granted by the U.S. Supreme Court. The EPA subsequently issued a policy memorandum on August 5, 2024, that provides an administrative stay of the rule; the D.C. Circuit thereafter issued a partial remand of the rule to allow the EPA to respond to comments regarding the severability of the rule s provisions. 
 Mercury and Air Toxic Standards (MATS) . In 2012, the EPA published the final MATS rule, which revised the NSPS for NO x , sulfur dioxide and PM for new and modified coal-fueled electricity generating plants, and imposed maximum achievable control technology (MACT) emission limits on hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from new and existing coal-fueled and oil-fueled electric generating plants. MACT standards limit emissions of mercury, acid gas HAPs, non-mercury HAP metals and organic HAPs. 
 On March 6, 2023, the EPA issued a final rule which reaffirmed its determination to regulate coal- and oil-fired EGUs under CAA section 112, including the regulation of HAPs from EGUs after considering cost. On April 24, 2023, the EPA proposed to amend the 2012 MATS rule and require an additional two-thirds reduction in the filterable PM emission of non-mercury HAP metals from existing coal-fired power plants and to reduce the mercury standard for lignite plants by 70 . On April 25, 2024, the EPA issued its final MATS rule which significantly tightens the filterable particulate matter (fPM) emissions limit for existing coal-fired EGU s, lowering the standard from 0.030 lb/MMBtu to 0.010 lb/MMBtu. 
 Regional Haze. The CAA contains a national visibility goal for the prevention of any future, and the remedying of any existing, impairment of visibility in Class I areas which impairment results from man-made air pollution. The EPA promulgated comprehensive regulations in 1999 requiring all states to submit plans to address regional haze that could affect 156 national parks and wilderness areas, including requirements for certain sources to install the best available retrofit technology and for states to demonstrate reasonable progress towards meeting the national visibility goal. States are required to revise plans every 10 years. On March 29, 2024, the EPA published a proposed consent decree under which deadlines would be established for the EPA to take final action to approve, disapprove or conditionally approve, in whole or in part, state regional haze implementation plans for 34 states (at various dates from June 28, 2024 to December 31, 2026). The EPA subsequently filed a motion to approve the consent judgement in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia which was granted. 
 Federal Coal Leasing Moratorium . The Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth (EI Order), signed on March 28, 2017, lifted the Department of Interior s federal coal leasing moratorium and rescinded guidance on the inclusion of social cost of carbon in federal rulemaking. Following the EI Order, the Interior Secretary issued Order 3349 ending the federal coal leasing moratorium. Environmental groups took the issue to court (District of Montana) and in April 2019, the court held the lifting of the moratorium triggered National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review. On May 22, 2020, the court held that the Department of Interior s issuance of an Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) remedied the prior NEPA violations. Thereafter, environmental groups amended their complaint to challenge the Environmental Assessment and FONSI. On August 12, 2022, the court invalidated the Environmental Assessment and FONSI and reinstated the moratorium until completion of a sufficient NEPA analysis. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) reversed the district court on February 21, 2024, explaining that the lawsuit was mooted by the Department of Interior s April 2021 order revoking Order 3349. The Ninth Circuit directed the district court to dismiss the case as moot.

Endangered Species Act (ESA) . The ESA of 1973 and counterpart state legislation is intended to protect species whose populations allow for categorization as either endangered or threatened. Changes in listings or requirements under these regulations could have a material adverse effect on Peabody s costs or its ability to mine some of its properties in accordance with its current mining plans. During the Trump Administration, the Departments of Interior and Commerce finalized five rules aiming to streamline and update the ESA. But in June 2021, the agencies announced their plan to revise, rescind or reinstate the rules that were finalized (or withdrawn) during the Trump Administration that conflict with the Biden Administration s objectives. The agencies issued proposed rules on June 22, 2023, and they published three final revised rules on April 5, 2024. 
 SEC Climate-Related Disclosures . On March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules it expects will enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures by public companies and in public offerings. Specifically, the final rules will require disclosure of, among other things, climate-related risks that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on a public company s business strategy, results of operations or financial condition; certain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with a public company along with, in many cases, an attestation report by a GHG emissions attestation provider; and certain climate-related financial metrics to be included in a company s audited financial statements. The final rules were challenged by multiple parties, and the cases were consolidated into a judicial review by the Eighth Circuit. On April 4, 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed implementation of the final rules pending such judicial review. The Company is assessing the potential impact of the final rules.

 Coal Mine Subsidence Compensation Amendment Act 2024 (NSW). On August 15, 2024, the Coal Mine Subsidence Compensation Amendment Act 2024 No. 48 (NSW) was passed into law. The amendment act amends the Coal Mine Subsidence Compensation Act 2017 No. 37 (NSW), implementing all nine recommendations of the 2023 statutory review. The amendments are designed to strengthen the compensation framework to ensure people affected by coal mine subsidence in New South Wales (NSW) can access compensation and support. The key amendments include extension of the chief executive s powers to evacuate people from land they reasonably believe has been damaged as a result of subsidence and that may cause danger to a member of the public; make payment from the fund for temporary accommodation for people who have been evacuated; requirement of the Subsidence Advisory to assess claims as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving a compensation claim; limitation on claims if pre-mining inspection was required and refused by the claimant and addition of powers to direct pre-mining inspections; requiring information and documents from coalmine operators; and clarifying the roles of Subsidence Advisory and mine operators in the assessment and determination of claims. 
 Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (NSW) . On June 4, 2024, the Work Health and Safety Amendment (Industrial Manslaughter) Bill 2024 (Bill) was introduced to the NSW Parliament. The Bill subsequently passed the NSW Parliament on June 20, 2024. The Bill amends the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (NSW) (NSW WHS Act) to include the offense of industrial manslaughter. The offense will apply to a person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) or an officer of a PCBU who engages in conduct that constitutes a failure to comply with the person s health and safety duty and causes the death of a worker or another individual to whom the duty is owed; and the person engages in conduct with gross negligence. The maximum penalty is 20 million Australian dollars for a body corporate or 25 years imprisonment for an individual. The Bill also provides for an alternative finding of guilt. That is, where a person is charged with industrial manslaughter, and on trial the court or jury is not satisfied that the person is guilty but is satisfied that the person is guilty of an offense against section 31 (Gross negligence or reckless conduct Category 1) of the NSW WHS Act, the person may be found guilty and liable to punishment for that offense. 
 Environmental Protection (Powers and Penalties) and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2024 (QLD) (Powers and Penalties Act). On June 18, 2024, the Environmental Protection (Powers and Penalties) and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2024 (QLD) (Powers and Penalties Act) received assent. The Powers and Penalties Act amends the powers and penalties provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (EP Act), facilitates a more proactive approach to environmental risk management and ensures timely and effective regulatory responses to environmental harm. The key changes include the general environmental duty becoming an offense provision, an increase in maximum penalties and the consolidation of the various enforcement instruments presently available under the EP Act into a single Environmental Enforcement Order.

National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER Act). The NGER Act imposes requirements for corporations meeting a certain threshold to register and report greenhouse gas emissions and abatement actions, as well as energy production and consumption as part of a single, national reporting system. The Clean Energy Regulator administers the NGER Act. The federal Department of Environment and Energy is responsible for NGER Act-related policy developments and review. In May 2023, the Australian Parliament passed reforms to the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Safeguard Mechanism) Rule 2015. The reforms commenced on July 1, 2023 and introduced site specific baseline emissions for heavy emitting facilities as benchmarks for year-on-year improvement (proposed to be 4.9 each year to 2030) before transitioning to industry average emissions benchmarks by 2030. Proponents will earn tradeable credits (Safeguard Mechanism Credits) when emissions are below their baselines or can purchase credits to offset emissions. Access to existing Australian Carbon Credit Units will continue unchanged albeit with a price ceiling of 75 Australian dollars per tonne of CO 2 in 2023-24, increasing with the Consumer Price Index plus 2 each year. In June 2024 amendments to the NGER Act came into effect requiring open-cut mines covered by the Safeguard Mechanism that currently report fugitive methane emissions using a basic method with minimal data inputs (Method 1) to transition over a two-year period to a more complex method requiring site-level sampling and analysis (Methods 2 or 3). This change in reporting methods is expected to increase the Safeguard Mechanism liability position of open-cut mining operations in Queensland. The impacts of this change are currently being assessed. 
 New South Wales Environmental . Under the NSW Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (EPA Act), environmental planning instruments must be considered when approving a mining project development application. Decision makers review the significance of a resource and the state and regional economic benefits of a proposed coal mine when considering a development application on the basis that it is an element of the public interest consideration contained in the relevant legislation. Effective from March 1, 2018, the EPA Act was amended to introduce a number of changes to planning laws in New South Wales. The EPA Act was further amended in June 2018 to revoke a process for modifying development approvals under the former Section 75W of the EPA Act. As a result, new development approvals will need to be obtained unless the proposed project will be substantially the same development as it was when the development approval was last modified under Section 75W, in which case the existing development approval can be modified. If a new development approval is required then this could take additional time to achieve. 
 On April 3, 2024, the Environment Protection Legislation Amendment (Stronger Regulation and Penalties) Bill 2024 was assented to by the Parliament of New South Wales. The bill increases the NSW Environment Protection Agency s (NSW EPA) powers across a range of environmental legislation including increasing the NSW EPA s maximum penalties for serious environmental offenses; increasing the NSW EPA s on-the-spot maximum fines; providing the NSW EPA the power to issue what will be known as Preliminary Investigation Notices which permit the NSW EPA to force a person to help the NSW EPA compile a criminal case against the person or against another person; extending the monetary benefits order so that it can apply to any related entity as defined in the Corporations Act 2001; providing the NSW EPA the power to issue what will be known as Recall Notices which order responsible entities to recall contaminated substances suspected of causing harm to the community and environment; and providing the NSW EPA the power to issue what will be known as name and shame public warnings to call out poor and repeat environmental performers for the protection of communities. The reform also creates a new power in Australia for the NSW Land and Environment Court that empowers the court to ban offenders, upon the NSW EPA s application, with a poor compliance history from seeking and obtaining environmental protection licenses. 
 On August 25, 2017, the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (BC Act) commenced in NSW and imposes a revised framework for the assessment of potential impacts on biodiversity that may be caused by a development, such as a proposed mining project. The BC Act requires these potential impacts on biodiversity to be offset in perpetuity, by one or more of the following means: securing land based offsets and retiring biodiversity credits, making a payment into a biodiversity conservation fund or in some cases through mine site ecological rehabilitation. The data collected from the biodiversity impact assessment process is inputted into a new offsets payment calculator in order to determine the amount payable by the proponent to offset the impacts. The proposed development can only proceed once the biodiversity offset obligations have been satisfied. On July 18, 2024, following an independent review of the BC Act, the NSW government announced it would amend the BC Act to reform the biodiversity offsets scheme. On August 13, 2024, the Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Biodiversity Offsets Scheme) Bill 2024 was introduced into NSW Parliament and, if passed into law, will require mining proponents to demonstrate they have genuinely avoided, minimized and offset impacts to biodiversity. The bill reinforces the current government s intent that biodiversity offsets are a last resort. Additionally, the bill proposes to replace the current no net loss standard for biodiversity with the requirement for proponents to achieve net positive biodiversity outcomes. If enacted, these and other proposed changes have the potential to affect approval processes for future NSW mining projects. NSW Parliament is expected to pass the bill by late November 2024.

New South Wales Coal Directions . The State of New South Wales enacted the Energy and Utilities Administration Amendment Act 2022 granting the State Premier and Minister for Energy the ability to issue directions in the event of a coal market price emergency (among other powers). On December 22, 2022, the State Premier declared such an emergency, intended to control coal and electricity pricing. Subsequently, directions were issued to Peabody Energy Australia Pty Ltd and other coal producers with operations in NSW, which were amended at various dates. The most recent directions required Peabody Energy Australia Pty Ltd to reserve a portion of coal produced by Wambo Coal Pty Ltd and Wilpinjong Coal Pty Ltd for sale to NSW power generators at a capped price until June 30, 2024 and imposed additional reporting obligations to demonstrate compliance. The Australian Energy Regulator has confirmed that the directions have ended, and the last report was submitted on July 12, 2024. 
 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. On August 16, 2024, Australia s Minister for the Environment and Water made a declaration under Section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 over a riverine area in NSW that is a proposed tailings dam site for a gold mining project. The declaration prohibits any mining or related development activity in the area despite the project having previously obtained all necessary environmental and planning approvals under state and federal government laws. The project proponent has indicated that the decision renders the mine project as no longer financially viable given the time required to develop and receive approvals for an alternative tailings dam site. The decision has the potential to affect future mining approvals in Australia. The proponent has until early November to apply for a judicial review of the minister s decision. 
 Risks Related to Global Climate Change 
 There have been no significant changes to the Company s global climate matters subsequent to December 31, 2023. Refer to Part I, Item 1. Business in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for information regarding the Company s global climate matters. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 The Company s primary source of cash is proceeds from the sale of its coal production to customers. The Company has also generated cash from the sale of non-strategic assets, including coal reserves, coal resources and surface lands, and, from time to time, borrowings under its credit facilities and the issuance of securities. The Company s primary uses of cash include the cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, coal reserve lease and royalty payments, debt service costs, finance and operating lease payments, postretirement plans, take-or-pay obligations, post-mining reclamation obligations, collateral and margining requirements, dividends, share repurchases and selling and administrative expenses. The Company has also used cash for early debt retirements. 
 Any future determinations to return capital to stockholders, such as dividends or share repurchases, will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company s net income or other sources of cash, liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash, such as internal development projects or acquisitions, as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results. The Company s ability to early retire debt, declare dividends or repurchase shares in the future will depend on its future financial performance, which in turn depends on the successful implementation of its strategy and on financial, competitive, regulatory, technical and other factors, general economic conditions, demand for and selling prices of coal and other factors specific to its industry, many of which are beyond the Company s control. 
 Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cash and cash equivalents balances totaled 772.9 million, including approximately 420 million held by U.S. subsidiaries, approximately 336 million held by Australian subsidiaries and the remainder held by other foreign subsidiaries in accounts predominantly domiciled in the U.S. A significant majority of the cash held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries is denominated in U.S. dollars. This cash is generally used to support non-U.S. liquidity needs, including capital and operating expenditures in Australia and payment of the foreign subsidiaries share of certain U.S. corporate expenditures. From time to time, the Company may repatriate profits from its foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. in the form of intercompany dividends. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no profits from foreign subsidiaries were repatriated. If foreign-held cash is repatriated in the future, the Company does not expect restrictions or potential taxes will have a material effect to its near-term liquidity.

Table of Contents 

The Company s available liquidity increased to 1,089.9 million as of September 30, 2024 from 1,059.7 million as of December 31, 2023. Available liquidity was comprised of the following: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Dollars in millions) Cash and cash equivalents 772.9 969.3 Revolving credit facility availability 221.4 Accounts receivable securitization program availability 95.6 90.4 Total liquidity 1,089.9 1,059.7 
 Capital Returns to Shareholders 
 The Company repurchased approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock for 180.5 million, including commission fees, and paid dividends of 28.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Surety Agreement Amendment and Collateral Requirements 
 In April 2023, the Company amended its existing agreement with the providers of its surety bond portfolio, dated November 6, 2020. Under the April 2023 amendment, the Company and its surety providers agreed to a maximum aggregate collateral amount of 721.8 million based upon bonding levels at the effective date of the amendment. This maximum collateral amount will vary prospectively as bonding levels increase or decrease. The amendment extended the agreement through December 31, 2026. In order to maintain the maximum collateral agreement, the Company must remain compliant with a minimum liquidity test and a maximum net leverage ratio, as measured each quarter. The minimum liquidity test requires the Company to maintain liquidity at the greater of 400 million or the difference between the penal sum of all surety bonds and the amount of collateral posted in favor of surety providers, which was 507.3 million at September 30, 2024. The Company must also maintain a maximum net leverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.0, where the numerator consists of its funded debt, net of cash, and the denominator consists of its Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months. For purposes of calculating the ratio, only 50 of the outstanding principal amount of the Company s 3.250 Convertible Senior Notes due March 2028 (the 2028 Convertible Notes) is deemed to be funded debt. The Company s ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases is also subject to the quarterly minimum liquidity test. The Company is in compliance with such requirements at September 30, 2024. 
 To fund the maximum collateral amount, the Company deposited 566.3 million into trust accounts for the benefit of certain surety providers on March 31, 2023. The remainder was comprised of 140.5 million of existing cash-collateralized letters of credit and 15.0 million already held on behalf of a surety provider. The amendment became effective on April 14, 2023, when the Company terminated a then-existing credit agreement. 
 Credit Support Facilities 
 In February 2022, the Company entered into an agreement which provides up to 250.0 million of capacity for irrevocable standby letters of credit, primarily to support reclamation bonding requirements. The agreement requires the Company to provide cash collateral at a level of 103 of the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding under the arrangement (limited to 5.0 million total excess collateralization). Outstanding letters of credit bear a fixed fee in the amount of 0.75 per annum. The Company receives a variable deposit rate on the amount of cash collateral posted in support of letters of credit. The agreement has an initial expiration date of December 31, 2025. At September 30, 2024, letters of credit of 116.6 million were outstanding under the agreement, which were collateralized by cash of 120.1 million. 
 In December 2023, the Company established cash-backed bank guarantee facilities, primarily to support Australian reclamation bonding requirements. The Company receives a variable deposit rate on the amount of cash collateral posted in support of the bank guarantee facilities, which mature at various dates between 2026 and 2029. At September 30, 2024, the bank guarantee facilities were backed by cash of 187.9 million. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 The Company established a new revolving credit facility with a maximum aggregate principal amount of 320.0 million in revolving commitments by entering into a credit agreement, dated as of January 18, 2024 (the 2024 Credit Agreement), by and among the Company, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto.

The revolving commitments and any related loans, if applicable (any such loans, the Revolving Loans), established by the 2024 Credit Agreement terminate or mature, as applicable, on January 18, 2028, subject to certain conditions relating to the Company s outstanding 2028 Convertible Notes. The Revolving Loans bear interest at a secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus an applicable margin ranging from 3.50 to 4.25 , depending on the Company s total net leverage ratio (as defined under the 2024 Credit Agreement) or a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.50 to 3.25 , at the Company s option. Letters of credit issued under the 2024 Credit Agreement incur a combined fee equal to an applicable margin ranging from 3.50 to 4.25 plus a fronting fee equal to 0.125 per annum. Unused capacity under the 2024 Credit Agreement bears a commitment fee of 0.50 per annum. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the 2024 Credit Agreement had only been utilized for letters of credit, including 98.6 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024. These letters of credit support the Company s reclamation bonding requirements, lease obligations, insurance policies and various other performance guarantees as further described in Note 12. Financial Instruments and Other Guarantees. Availability under the 2024 Credit Agreement was 221.4 million at September 30, 2024. 
 The 2024 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions (including compliance with financial ratios), may limit the Company and its subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness, make certain restricted payments or investments, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, create or incur liens, and merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of their assets. The 2024 Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries, as well as a pledge of two Australian subsidiaries. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 The Company increased its targeted capital expenditures for 2024 from approximately 375 million to 425 million. The increase is primarily driven by the acceleration of the planned capital spend at the Centurion Mine as development rates have advanced ahead of projected timelines and timing of spend at the Wambo Open-Cut Mine. 
 Indebtedness 
 The Company s total indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is presented in the table below. 
 Debt Instrument (defined below, as applicable) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Dollars in millions) 3.250 Convertible Senior Notes due March 2028 (2028 Convertible Notes) 320.0 320.0 Finance lease obligations 25.1 22.3 Less: Debt issuance costs (6.6) (8.1) 338.5 334.2 Less: Current portion of long-term debt 14.8 13.5 Long-term debt 323.7 320.7 
 The Company s indebtedness requires estimated contractual principal and interest payments, assuming interest rates in effect at September 30, 2024, of approximately 8 million in 2024, 20 million in 2025, 17 million in 2026, 13 million in 2027 and 326 million in 2028. 
 Cash paid for interest, net of capitalized interest related to the Company s indebtedness and financial assurance instruments amounted to 32.6 million and 56.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 2028 Convertible Notes 
 On March 1, 2022, through a private offering, the Company issued the 2028 Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 320.0 million. The 2028 Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are governed under an indenture. 
 The Company used the proceeds of the offering of the 2028 Convertible Notes and available cash to redeem its then-existing senior secured notes, and to pay related premiums, fees and expenses relating to the offering and redemptions. 
 
 46 

Table of Contents 

The 2028 Convertible Notes will mature on March 1, 2028, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The 2028 Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.250 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. 
 During the first three quarters of 2024, the Company s reported common stock prices did not prompt the conversion feature of the 2028 Convertible Notes. As a result, the 2028 Convertible Notes were not convertible at the option of the holders during the second or third quarters of 2024, and will not be similarly convertible during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Accounts Receivable Securitization Program 
 As described in Note 12. Financial Instruments and Other Guarantees of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company entered into an accounts receivable securitization program during 2017. The securitization program was amended in February 2023 to increase the available funding capacity from 175.0 million to 225.0 million and adjust the relevant interest rate for borrowings to a SOFR plus an applicable margin. Funding capacity is limited to the availability of eligible receivables and is accounted for as a secured borrowing. Funding capacity under the program may also be utilized for letters of credit in support of other obligations, which has been the Company s primary utilization. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings and 60.4 million of letters of credit outstanding under the program. The Company was not required to post cash collateral under the securitization program at September 30, 2024. 
 Covenant Compliance 
 The Company was compliant with all relevant covenants under its debt and other finance agreements at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes the Company s cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as reported in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Available Free Cash Flow is a financial measure not recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section above for definitions and reconciliations to the most comparable measures under U.S. GAAP. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 486.7 753.1 Net cash used in investing activities (389.6) (174.6) Net cash used in financing activities (268.8) (364.5) Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (171.7) 214.0 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 1,650.2 1,417.6 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period 1,478.5 1,631.6 Available Free Cash Flow 37.6 
 Operating Activities. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by a year-over-year decrease in operating cash flow from working capital 260.9 million), primarily attributable to income tax payments and accruals 218.8 million) and Shoal Creek inventories build due to the lock outages during 2024 61.1 million); the prior year receipt of cash related to variation margin requirements associated with derivative financial instruments 198.0 million); and lower cash generated from mining operations. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by decreases in cash used for collateral requirements 289.2 million) and discontinued operations 74.9 million) primarily related to the prior year use of cash to settle disputed black lung claims. 
 Investing Activities. The increase in net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by the acquisition of Wards Well 143.8 million) and higher capital expenditures 75.3 million).

Financing Activities. The decrease in net cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by decreases in common stock repurchases 80.9 million) and distributions to noncontrolling interest 24.1 million), partially offset by an increase in payment of debt issuance and other deferred financing costs 10.8 million). 
 
 Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements 
 In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to various guarantees and financial instruments that carry off-balance-she et risk and are not reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Such financial instruments provide support for the Company s reclamation bonding requirements, lease obligations, insurance policies and various other performance guarantees. The Company periodically evaluates the instruments for on-balance-sheet treatment based on the amount of exposure under the instrument and the likelihood of required performance. The Company does not expect any material losses to result from these guarantees or off-balance-sheet instruments in excess of liabilities provided for in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 The following table summarizes the Company s financial instruments that carry off-balance-sheet risk. 
 September 30, 2024 Reclamation Support Other Support (1) 
 Total (Dollars in millions) Surety bonds 932.2 107.7 1,039.9 Letters of credit (2) 
 55.2 103.8 159.0 987.4 211.5 1,198.9 Less: Letters of credit in support of surety bonds (3) 
 (55.2) (12.4) (67.6) Obligations supported, net 932.2 199.1 1,131.3 
 (1) Instruments support obligations related to pension and health care plans, workers compensation, property and casualty insurance, customer and vendor contracts and certain restoration ancillary to prior mining activities. 
 (2) Amounts do not include cash-collateralized letters of credit. 
 (3) Certain letters of credit serve as collateral for surety bonds at the request of surety bond providers. 
 Not presented in the above table is 839.0 million of restricted cash and other balances serving as collateral which are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024, as described in Note 12. Financial Instruments and Other Guarantees of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Such collateral is primarily in support of the financial instruments noted above, including in relation to the Company s surety bond portfolio, its collateralized letter of credit agreement, its bank guarantee facilities and amounts held directly with beneficiaries which are not supported by surety bonds. The restricted cash and collateral balance decreased 118.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to collateral releases related to reductions in reclamation bonding requirements, replacement of cash-collateralized letters of credit with letters of credit under the new revolving credit facility and the impact of foreign currency rate changes. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had total asset retirement obligations of 701.4 million. Bonding requirement amounts may differ significantly from the re lated asset retirement obligation because such requirements are calculated under the assumption that reclamation begins currently, whereas the Company s accounting liabilities are discounted from the end of a mine s economic life (when final reclamation work would begin) to the balance sheet date. 
 As noted above, the Company s reclamation bonding requirements decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an approximate 110 million reduction in U.S. reclamation bonding requirements. At September 30, 2024, the Company s reclamation bonding requirements were supported by approximately 725 million of restricted cash and other balances serving as collateral, which exceeds the financial liability for final mine reclamation as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company is also required under U.S. GAAP to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company identified certain assets with an aggregate carrying value of approximately 207 million in its Other U.S. Thermal segment whose recoverability is most sensitive to customer concentration risk. 
 The Company s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company s critical accounting policies remain unchanged at September 30, 2024, and there have been no material changes in the Company s critical accounting estimates. 
 
 Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented 
 See Note 2. Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of newly adopted accounting standards and accounting standards not yet implemented. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Coal Pricing Risk 
 The Company predominantly manages its commodity price risk for its non-trading, long-term coal contract portfolio through the use of long-term coal supply agreements (those with terms longer than one year) to the extent possible, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 100 million tons of U.S. thermal coal priced and committed for 2024. This includes approximately 85 million tons of PRB coal and 15 million tons of other U.S. thermal coal. The Company has the flexibility to increase volumes should demand warrant. Peabody is estimating full year 2024 thermal coal sales volumes from its Seaborne Thermal segment of 16.0 million to 16.4 million tons comprised of thermal export volume of 10.0 million to 10.4 million tons and domestic volume of 6.0 million tons. Peabody is estimating full year 2024 metallurgical coal sales from its Seaborne Metallurgical segment of 7.2 million to 7.6 million tons. Sales commitments in the metallurgical coal market are typically not long-term in nature, and the Company is therefore subject to fluctuations in market pricing. The Company s sensitivity to market pricing in thermal coal markets is dependent on the duration of contracts. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no coal derivative contracts related to its forecasted sales. Historically, such financial contracts have included futures and forwards. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 The Company utilizes options and collars to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar operating expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 6. Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held average rate options with an aggregate notional amount of 531.0 million Australian dollars to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar operating expenditures over the nine-month period ending June 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company also held purchased collars with an aggregate notional amount of 468.0 million Australian dollars related to anticipated Australian dollar operating expenditures during the nine-month period ending June 30, 2025. Assuming the Company had no foreign currency hedging instruments in place, its exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a 0.10 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately 205 million to 215 million for the next twelve months. Based upon the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate at September 30, 2024, the currency option contracts outstanding at that date would limit the Company s exposure to approximately 127 million with respect to a 0.10 increase in the exchange rate, while the Company would benefit by approximately 198 million with respect to a 0.10 decrease in the exchange rate for the next twelve months.

Table of Contents 

Although Peabody believes its Australian dollar monetary asset position acts as a hedge to lessen the impact on its results from operations, the Company may continue to use options and collars to hedge its cash flow exposure to currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar operating expenditures. 
 Diesel Fuel Price Risk 
 The Company expects to consume 85 to 95 million gallons of diesel fuel during the next twelve months. A 10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease its annual diesel fuel costs by approximately 21 million based on its expected usage. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any diesel fuel derivative instruments in place. The Company partially manages the price risk of diesel fuel through the use of cost pass-through contacts with certain customers. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Peabody s objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. Peabody is primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of its interest-earning cash balances. 
 Peabody s interest-earning cash and restricted cash balances are primarily held in deposit accounts and investments with maturities of three months or less. Therefore, these balances are subject to interest rate fluctuations and could produce less income if interest rates fall. Based upon its interest-earning cash and restricted cash balances at September 30, 2024, a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately 15 million to interest income for the next twelve months. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, among other things, provide reasonable assurance that material information, both financial and non-financial, and other information required under the securities laws to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to senior management, including its principal executive and financial officers, on a timely basis. The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2024, and concluded that such controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the desired control objectives were achieved. Additionally, there have been no changes to the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

 50 

Table of Contents 

if a substantial number of the Company s long-term coal supply agreements, including those with its largest customers, terminate, or if the pricing, volumes or other elements of those agreements materially adjust, its revenue and operating profits could suffer if the Company is unable to find alternate buyers willing to purchase its coal on comparable terms to those in its contracts; 
 risks inherent to mining could increase the cost of operating the Company s business, and events and conditions that could occur during the course of its mining operations could have a material adverse impact on the Company; 
 the Company s take-or-pay arrangements could unfavorably affect its profitability; 
 the Company may not recover its investments in its mining, exploration and other assets, which may require the Company to recognize impairment charges related to those assets; 
 the Company s ability to operate effectively could be impaired if it loses key personnel or fails to attract qualified personnel; 
 the Company could be negatively affected if it fails to maintain satisfactory labor relations; 
 the Company could be adversely affected if it fails to appropriately provide financial assurances for its obligations; 
 if the assumptions underlying the Company s asset retirement obligations for reclamation and mine closures are materially inaccurate, its costs could be significantly greater than anticipated; 
 the Company s mining operations are extensively regulated, which imposes significant costs on it, and future regulations and developments could increase those costs or limit its ability to produce coal; 
 the Company s operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and its properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to the Company; 
 the Company may be unable to obtain, renew or maintain permits necessary for its operations, or the Company may be unable to obtain, renew or maintain such permits without conditions on the manner in which it runs its operations, which would reduce its production, cash flows and profitability; 
 concerns about the impacts of coal combustion on global climate are increasingly leading to conditions that have affected and could continue to affect demand for the Company s products or its securities and its ability to produce, including increased governmental regulation of coal combustion and unfavorable investment decisions by electricity generators; 
 numerous activist groups are devoting substantial resources to anti-coal activities to minimize or eliminate the use of coal as a source of electricity generation, domestically and internationally, thereby further reducing the demand and pricing for coal, and potentially materially and adversely impacting the Company s future financial results, liquidity and growth prospects; 
 the Company s trading and hedging activities do not cover certain risks and may expose it to earnings volatility and other risks; 
 the Company s future success depends upon its ability to continue acquiring and developing coal reserves and resources that are economically recoverable; 
 the Company faces numerous uncertainties in estimating its coal reserves and resources and inaccuracies in its estimates could result in lower than expected revenue, higher than expected costs and decreased profitability; 
 joint ventures, partnerships or non-managed operations may not be successful and may not comply with the Company s operating standards; 
 the Company s expenditures for postretirement benefit obligations could be materially higher than it has predicted if its underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect; 
 high inflation could continue to result in higher costs and decreased profitability; 
 the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by pandemic or other widespread illnesses and the related effects on public health; 
 Peabody is exposed to risks associated with political or international conflicts; 
 Peabody could be exposed to significant liability, reputational harm, loss of revenue, increased costs or other risks if it sustains cybersecurity attacks or other security breaches that disrupt its operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about the Company, its customers or other third-parties;

 the Company is subject to various general operating risks which may be fully or partially outside of its control; 
 
 51 

Table of Contents 

the Company may be able to incur more debt, including secured debt, which could increase the risks associated with its indebtedness; 
 the terms of the agreements and instruments governing the Company s debt and surety bonding obligations impose restrictions that may limit its operating and financial flexibility; 
 the number and quantity of viable financing and insurance alternatives available to the Company may be significantly impacted by unfavorable lending and investment policies by financial institutions and insurance companies associated with concerns about environmental impacts of coal combustion, and negative views around its efforts with respect to environmental and social matters and related governance considerations could harm the perception of the Company by a significant number of investors or result in the exclusion of its securities from consideration by those investors; 
 the price of Peabody s securities may be volatile; 
 Peabody s common stock is subject to dilution and may be subject to further dilution in the future; 
 there may be circumstances in which the interests of a significant stockholder could be in conflict with other stakeholders interests;

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On April 17, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (2023 Repurchase Program) authorizing repurchases of up to 1.0 billion of its common stock. 
 Under the 2023 Repurchase Program, the Company may purchase shares of common stock from time to time at the discretion of management through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated or other structured share repurchase programs or other means. The amount of any share repurchase transactions is subject to the Company s annual AFCF. The manner, timing, and pricing of any share repurchase transactions will be based on a variety of factors, including market conditions, applicable legal requirements and alternative opportunities that the Company may have for the use or investment of capital. Through September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased 23.8 million shares of its common stock under the 2023 Repurchase Program for 530.8 million, which included commissions paid of 0.4 million, leaving million available for share repurchase. 
 Dividends 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company declared dividends per share of 0.075 and 0.225, respectively.

The declaration and payment of dividends and the amount of dividends will depend on the Company s annual AFCF. 
 Share Relinquishments 
 The Company routinely allows employees to relinquish Common Stock to pay estimated taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock units and the payout of performance units that are settled in Common Stock under its equity incentive plans. The value of Common Stock tendered by employees is determined based on the closing price of the Company s Common Stock on the dates of the respective relinquishments.

Exhibit 95 
 Mine Safety Disclosures 
 The following disclosures are provided pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which require certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that operate coal mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act). The disclosures reflect United States (U.S.) mining operations only, as these requirements do not apply to our mines operated outside the U.S. 
 Mine Safety Information. Whenever the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) believes that a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard, or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a violation which describes the associated condition or practice and designates a timeframe within which the operator must abate the violation. In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine affected by the condition until hazards are corrected. Whenever MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the violation that the operator is ordered to pay. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed and, as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes vacated. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments vary depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the company and mine. Since MSHA is a branch of the U.S. Department of Labor, its jurisdiction applies only to our U.S. mines. As such, the mine safety disclosures that follow contain no information for our Australian mines. 
 The tables that follow reflect citations and orders issued to us by MSHA during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as reflected in our systems. The tables include only those mines that were issued orders or citations during the periods presented and, commensurate with SEC regulations, do not reflect orders or citations issued to independent contractors working at our mines. Due to timing and other factors, our data may not agree with the mine data retrieval system maintained by MSHA. The proposed assessments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were taken from the MSHA system as of November 6, 2024. 
 Additional information about MSHA references used in the tables is as follows 
 Section 104 S&S Violations The total number of violations received from MSHA under section 104(a) of the Mine Act that could significantly and substantially contribute to a serious injury if left unabated. 
 Section 104(b) Orders The total number of orders issued by MSHA under section 104(b) of the Mine Act, which represents a failure to abate a citation under section 104(a) within the period of time prescribed by MSHA. This results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition until MSHA determines that the violation has been abated. 
 Section 104(d) Citations and Orders The total number of citations and orders issued by MSHA under section 104(d) of the Mine Act for unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory health or safety standards. 
 Section 104(e) Notices The total number of notices issued by MSHA under section 104(e) of the Mine Act for a pattern of violations that could contribute to mine health or safety hazards. 
 Section 110(b)(2) Violations The total number of flagrant violations issued by MSHA under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act. 
 Section 107(a) Orders The total number of orders issued by MSHA under section 107(a) of the Mine Act for situations in which MSHA determined an imminent danger existed. 
 Proposed MSHA Assessments The total dollar value of proposed assessments from MSHA. 
 Fatalities The total number of mining-related fatalities.

Pending Legal Actions . The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission) is an independent adjudicative agency that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the Mine Act. These cases may involve, among other questions, challenges by operators to citations, orders and penalties they have received from MSHA, or complaints of discrimination by miners under section 105 of the Mine Act. The following is a brief description of the types of legal actions that may be brought before the Commission. 
 Contests of Citations and Orders A contest proceeding may be filed with the Commission by operators, miners or miners representatives to challenge the issuance of a citation or order issued by MSHA, including citations related to disputed provisions of operators' emergency response plans. 
 Contests of Proposed Penalties (Petitions for Assessment of Penalties) A contest of a proposed penalty is an administrative proceeding before the Commission challenging a civil penalty that MSHA has proposed for the violation. Such proceedings may also involve appeals of judges' decisions or orders to the Commission on proposed penalties, including petitions for discretionary review and review by the Commission on its own motion. 
 Complaints for Compensation A complaint for compensation may be filed with the Commission by miners entitled to compensation when a mine is closed by certain withdrawal orders issued by MSHA. The purpose of the proceeding is to determine the amount of compensation, if any, due miners idled by the orders. 
 Complaints of Discharge, Discrimination or Interference A discrimination proceeding is a case that involves a miner s allegation that he or she has suffered a wrong by the operator because he or she engaged in some type of activity protected under the Mine Act, such as making a safety complaint. This category includes temporary reinstatement proceedings, which involve cases in which a miner has filed a complaint with MSHA stating he or she has suffered discrimination and the miner has lost his or her position. 
 Applications for Temporary Relief An application for temporary relief from any modification or termination of any order or from any order issued under certain subparts of section 104 of the Mine Act may be filed with the Commission at any time before such order becomes final. 
 The table that follows presents information by mine regarding pending legal actions before the Commission at September 30, 2024. Each legal action is assigned a docket number by the Commission and may have as its subject matter one or more citations, orders, penalties or complaints.
