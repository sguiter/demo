You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as may, will, should, expect, anticipate, believe, intend, estimate, plan and continue or similar words. We have based these statements on our current expectations about potential future events. Although we believe the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the reports, statements, information and announcements incorporated by reference into this report are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, whether oral or written, made by us or on our behalf. Many of these factors have previously been identified in filings or statements made by us or on our behalf. Important factors which could cause our actual results to differ, possibly materially from the forward-looking statements in this report include but are not limited to the following items, in addition to those matters described in Part I, Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations :

The requirement for additional resources and time to adequately respond to dynamics resulting from rapid technological change; 

The loss of or significant change to any of our insurance company relationships, which could result in loss of capacity to write business, additional expense, loss of market share or material decrease in our commissions; 

The effect of natural disasters on our profit-sharing contingent commissions, insurer capacity or claims expenses within our capitalized captive insurance facilities; 

Adverse economic conditions, political conditions, outbreaks of war, disasters, or regulatory changes in states or countries where we have a concentration of our business;

Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations; 

Improper disclosure of confidential information; 

Our ability to comply with non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies; 

The potential adverse effect of certain actual or potential claims, regulatory actions or proceedings on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity;

Increasing scrutiny and changing laws and expectations from regulators, investors and customers with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices and disclosure; 

A decrease in demand for liability insurance as a result of tort reform legislation; 

Our failure to comply with any covenants contained in our debt agreements; 

The possibility that covenants in our debt agreements could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities; 

Changes in the U.S.-based credit markets that might adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition; 

Changes in current U.S. or global economic conditions, including an extended slowdown in the markets in which we operate; 

Disintermediation within the insurance industry, including increased competition from insurance companies, technology companies and the financial services industry, as well as the shift away from traditional insurance markets;

 reportable segments. The Retail segment provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial, public and quasi-public entities, professional and individual insured customers, and non-insurance risk-mitigating products through our automobile and recreational vehicle dealer services F I businesses. The Programs segment, which acts as a managing general underwriter MGU ), provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals, a range of insurance products for individuals, flood coverage, and targeted products and services designated for specific industries, trade groups, governmental entities and market niches, all of which are delivered through a nationwide network of independent agents, including Brown Brown retail agents. The Wholesale Brokerage segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance, primarily through independent agents and brokers, as well as Brown Brown retail agents. The Company primarily operates as an agent or broker not assuming underwriting risks. However, we operate a write-your-own flood insurance carrier, Wright National Flood Insurance Company WNFIC ). WNFIC s underwriting business consists of policies written pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Program NFIP ), the program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA to which premiums and underwriting exposure are ceded, and excess flood policies which are fully reinsured in the private market . The Company also operates two capitalized captive insurance facilities (the "Captives") for the purpose of facilitating additional underwriting capacity, generating incremental revenues and participating in underwriting results. 

to segments beginning in fiscal year 2024. As a result of the segment reorganization, the Services segment was eliminated as a business segment. The Company now reports its financial results in the following three reportable segments: Retail, Programs and Wholesale Brokerage. The historical results, discussion and presentation of our business segments as set forth in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and these Notes reflect the impact of these changes for all periods presented in order to present segment information on a comparable basis. The results of the businesses sold in the fourth quarter of 2023 are presented within the Programs segment. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated statements of income, balance sheets, statements of cash flows, statements of comprehensive income or statements of equity resulting from these changes. See Note 12 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Pursuant to the sale of certain third-party claims administration and adjusting services businesses in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company is entitled to future consideration payments upon achievement of certain conditions in accordance with the terms of the sale agreement. During the second quarter of 2024, the conditions associated with one of the contingent payments were achieved which resulted in the Company recognizing a gain of million within the Programs segment.

Total revenues 

(1) Base commissions generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds underlying insurable exposure units, which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk (such as property values, or sales and payroll levels) to determine what premium to charge the insured. Insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors, including loss experience, risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies, none of which we control. 

 (2) Fee revenues relate to fees for services other than securing coverage for our customers, fees negotiated in lieu of commissions, and F I products and services. 

 (3) Other supplemental commissions include additional commissions over base commissions received from insurance carriers based on predetermined growth or production measures. This includes incentive commissions and guaranteed supplemental commissions. 

 (4) Profit-sharing contingent commissions are based primarily on underwriting results, but may also reflect considerations for volume, growth and/or retention. 

 (5) Earned premium relates to the premiums earned in the Captives. 

 (6) Investment income consists primarily of interest on cash and investments. 

 (7) Other income consists primarily of other miscellaneous income. 

 (8) Fees within Other reflect the elimination of intercompany revenues.

Total revenues 

Contract Assets and Liabilities 

Contract liabilities 

Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the Company recognizes revenue for amounts which have not yet been billed in the Company's systems and are reflected in commissions, fees and other receivables in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The increase in contract assets over the balance as of December 31, 2023 is due to normal seasonality, growth in the business and from businesses acquired in the current year. Deferred revenue (contract liabilities) relates to payments received in advance of performance under the contract before the transfer of a good or service to the customer. Deferred revenue is reflected within accrued expenses and other liabilities for those to be recognized in less than twelve months and in other liabilities for those to be recognized more than twelve months from the date presented in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, deferred revenue consisted of million as the current portion to be recognized within one year and million in long-term to be recognized beyond one year. As of December 31, 2023, deferred revenue consisted of million as the current portion to be recognized within one year and million in long-term deferred revenue to be recognized beyond one year.

million and million, consisting of additional variable consideration received on our incentive and profit-sharing contingent commissions. Other Assets and Deferred Cost Incremental cost to obtain - The Company defers certain costs to obtain customer contracts primarily as they relate to commission-based compensation plans in the Retail segment, in which the Company pays an incremental amount of compensation on new business. These incremental costs are deferred and amortized over a period. The cost to obtain balance within the other assets caption in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company deferred million of incremental cost to obtain customer contracts. The Company recorded an expense of million associated with the incremental cost to obtain customer contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cost to fulfill - The Company defers certain costs to fulfill contracts and recognizes these costs as the associated performance obligations are fulfilled. The cost to fulfill balance within the other current assets caption in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 was million . The cost to fulfill balance as of December 31, 2023 was million . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had net expense of million related to the release of previously deferred contract fulfillment costs associated with performance obligations that were satisfied in the period, net of current year deferrals for costs incurred that related to performance obligations yet to be fulfilled.

insurance intermediaries, purchased assets and assumed certain liabilities of insurance intermediaries, and purchased books of business (customer accounts) for a total of acquisitions. Additionally, adjustments were recorded to the purchase price allocation of certain prior acquisitions completed within the last twelve months as permitted by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805 Business Combinations ASC 805 ). The recorded purchase price for all acquisitions includes an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions. Subsequent changes in the fair value of earn-out obligations are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income when incurred. The fair value of earn-out obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements. Based on the acquisition date and the complexity of the underlying valuation work, certain amounts included in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements may be provisional and thus subject to further adjustments within the permitted measurement period, as defined in ASC 805. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , adjustments were made within the permitted measurement period for the following: an increase to total consideration of million, an increase to fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities of million, increase to non-controlling interest of million, increase in amortizable intangible assets of million, decrease to other net assets of million and net increase in goodwill of million. These measurement period adjustments have been reflected as current period adjustments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in accordance with the guidance in ASU 2015-16 Business Combinations. The measurement period adjustments had no effect on earnings or cash in the current period. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company completed acquisition with total consideration in excess of million. The maximum purchase price for the acquisition is million. Certain disclosures have not been presented as the effect of the acquisitions were not material to the Company's financial results .

ceded to a highly rated reinsurance carrier. The Company also operates two Captives for the purpose of facilitating additional underwriting capacity and to participate in a portion of the underwriting results. One Captive participates on a quota share basis for policies placed by certain of our MGU businesses that are currently focused on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties with a portion of premiums ceded to reinsurance companies, limiting, but not fully eliminating the Company's exposure to underwriting losses. The other Captive participates through excess of loss reinsurance layers associated with one of our MGU businesses focused on placements of personal property, excluding flood, primarily in the southeastern United States with one layer of per risk excess reinsurance and three layers of catastrophe per occurrence reinsurance. All four layers have limited reinstatements and therefore have capped, maximum aggregate limits. The effects of reinsurance on premiums written and earned are as follows:

All premiums written by the Company under NFIP are ceded to FEMA, for which WNFIC received a gross expense allowance from January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024. For the same period, the Company ceded million of written premiums to FEMA for NFIP policies and million to highly rated carriers for excess flood policies. As of September 30, 2024 the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets contained reinsurance recoverable of million and prepaid reinsurance premiums of million, which are related to the WNFIC business. For flood policies, there was change in the balance in the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense net of reinsurance recoverable during the period January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, as the Company's direct premiums written were ceded to reinsurers. The balance of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense for the WNFIC, excluding related reinsurance recoverable, as of September 30, 2024 was million. These balances primarily relate to claims activity from Hurricane Helene which occurred in late September 2024. The Company expects to process additional flood claims resulting from Hurricane Milton, which occurred in October 2024. WNFIC maintains capital in excess of the minimum statutory amount of million as required by regulatory authorities. The statutory capital and surplus of WNFIC was million at September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023. For the period from January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, WNFIC generated statutory net income of million . For the period from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023, WNFIC generated statutory net income of million . The maximum amount of ordinary dividends that WNFIC can pay in a rolling twelve month period is limited to the greater of of statutory adjusted capital and surplus or of adjusted net income. On June 10, 2024, WNFIC paid an ordinary dividend of million. The dividend was declared and approved by the WNFIC Board of Directors on May 28, 2024. On April 28, 2023, WNFIC paid an ordinary dividend of million. The dividend was declared and approved by the WNFIC Board of Directors by consent on March 17, 2023. The maximum dividend payout that may be made in 2024 and without prior approval is million .

For nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the ultimate loss expense inclusive of incurred but not reported ("IBNR") claims was million, of which million is related to the estimated insured losses resulting from Hurricane Ian. As of September 30, 2024, the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet contained deferred acquisitions costs of million, reinsurance payable for million, and the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense, excluding related reinsurance recoverable, was million. The first collateral release was received in March 2024 and is based on an IBNR factor times earned premium compared to the current collateral balance. The excess of loss layer Captive was renewed in June 2024 with underlying reinsurance treaties effective from June 1, 2024 through May 31, 2025.

ITEM 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion updates the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and the two discussions should be read together. 
 GENERAL 
 Company Overview Third Quarter of 2024 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to those Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, please see Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures below concerning important information on non-GAAP financial measures contained in our discussion and analysis. 
 Effective for fiscal year 2024, in conjunction with the divestiture of certain businesses within our Services segment in the fourth quarter of 2023, we aligned our business from four to three segments, and we now report our financial results in the following three reportable segments: Retail, Programs (formerly National Programs) and Wholesale Brokerage. See Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 We are a diversified insurance agency, wholesale brokerage and insurance programs organization headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida. As an insurance intermediary, our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and, to a lesser extent, fees paid directly by customers. Commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds underlying insurable exposure units, which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk (such as property values, sales or payroll levels) to determine what premium to charge the insured. Insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors, including loss experience, risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies, none of which we control. We also operate capitalized captive insurance facilities (the "Captives") for the purpose of having additional capacity to place coverage, drive additional revenues and to participate in underwriting results. The Captives focus on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties underwritten by certain of our MGUs and limit the Company's exposure to claims expenses through reinsurance or by only participating in certain tranches of the underwriting. 
 The volume of business from new and existing customers, fluctuations in insurable exposure units, changes in premium rate levels, changes in general economic and competitive conditions, a reduction of purchased limits, or the occurrence of catastrophic weather events all affect our revenues. For example, higher levels of inflation, an increase the value of insurable exposure units or a general decline in economic activity, could decrease the value or amount of insurable exposure units. Conversely, increasing costs of litigation settlements and/or awards could cause some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage. Historically, we have grown our revenues as a result of our focus on new business, customer retention and acquisitions. We foster a strong, decentralized sales and service culture, which enables responsiveness to changing business conditions and drives accountability for results. 
 The term core commissions and fees excludes profit-sharing contingent commissions, and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold, and specific fee-based services rendered. The net change in core commissions and fees reflects the aggregate changes attributable to: (i) net new and lost accounts; (ii) net changes in our customers exposure units, deductibles or insured limits; (iii) net changes in insurance premium rates or the commission rate paid to us by our carrier partners; (iv) the net change in fees paid to us by our customers and (v) any businesses acquired or disposed of. 
 We also earn profit-sharing contingent commissions, which are commissions based primarily on underwriting results, but in select situations may reflect additional considerations for volume, growth and/or retention. These commissions, which are included in our commissions and fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income, are estimated and accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written and knowledge, to the extent it is available, of losses incurred. Payments are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each subsequent year, based upon the aforementioned considerations for the prior year(s), but may differ from the amount estimated and accrued due to the lack of complete visibility regarding loss information until they are received. Over the last three years, profit-sharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 3.3 of commissions and fees revenue. 
 Fee revenues primarily relate to services other than securing coverage for our customers, and for fees negotiated in lieu of commissions. Fee revenues are generated by: (i) our Programs and Wholesale Brokerage segments, which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance carriers and (ii) our Retail segment in our large-account customer base, where we primarily earn fees for securing insurance for our customers, in our automobile dealer services F I businesses where we earn fees for assisting our customers with creating and selling warranty and service risk management programs and fees for Medicare Set-aside services, Social Security disability services and Medicare benefits advocacy services. Fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees, were 23.9 in 2023 and 25.8 in 2022. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our total commissions and fees growth rate was 10.1 , and our consolidated Organic Revenue growth rate was 9.5 . 
 24 

Historically, investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on operating cash and where permitted, on premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies. Our policy as it relates to the Company s capital is to invest available funds in high-quality, short-term money-market funds and fixed income investment securities. Investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments. Other income primarily reflects other miscellaneous revenues. 
 Income before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the third quarter of 2023 by 75 million or 31.0 , driven by Organic Revenue growth, leveraging our expense base, net new business, increased investment income, acquisitions completed in the past twelve months and the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. 
 Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In the discussion and analysis of our results of operations, in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), we provide references to the following non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of the SEC rules: Organic Revenue, EBITDAC, EBITDAC Margin, EBITDAC - Adjusted and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted. We present these measures because we believe such information is of interest to the investment community and because we believe it provides additional meaningful methods to evaluate the Company s operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis due to the impact of certain items that have a high degree of variability, that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance and that are not easily comparable from period to period. This non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company s consolidated income statements and balance sheets as of the relevant date. Consistent with Regulation G, a description of such information is provided below and tabular reconciliations of this supplemental non-GAAP financial information to our most comparable GAAP information are contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under Results of Operations - Segment Information. 
 We view Organic Revenue and Organic Revenue growth as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance on a consolidated basis and for each of our three segments, because they allow us to determine a comparable, but non-GAAP, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year and that are expected to continue in the future. We also view EBITDAC, EBITDAC - Adjusted, EBITDAC Margin and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance, as they present more comparable measurements of our operating margins in a meaningful and consistent manner. As disclosed in our most recent proxy statement, we use Organic Revenue growth, and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted as key performance metrics for our short-term and long-term incentive compensation plans for executive officers and other key employees. 
 Beginning January 1, 2024, we no longer exclude Foreign Currency Translation from the calculation of EBITDAC - Adjusted and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted. Prior periods are presented on the same basis so that the calculations of EBITDAC - Adjusted and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted are comparable for both periods. We no longer exclude Foreign Currency Translation from the calculation of these earnings measures because fluctuations in Foreign Currency Translation affect both our revenues and expenses, largely offsetting each other. Therefore, excluding Foreign Currency Translation from these earnings measures provides no meaningful incremental value in evaluating our financial performance. 
 
 Non-GAAP Revenue Measures 
 Organic Revenue is our core commissions and fees less: (i) the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newly acquired operations; (ii) divested business (core commissions and fees generated from offices, books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period) and (iii) Foreign Currency Translation (as defined below). The term core commissions and fees excludes profit-sharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific fee-based services rendered. Organic Revenue can be expressed as a dollar amount or a percentage rate when describing Organic Revenue growth. 

Non-GAAP Earnings Measures 
 EBITDAC is defined as income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. 

EBITDAC Margin is defined as EBITDAC divided by total revenues. 

EBITDAC - Adjusted is defined as EBITDAC, excluding (i) (gain)/loss on disposal, (ii) for 2022 and 2023, Acquisition/Integration Costs (as defined below) and (iii) for 2023, the 1Q23 Nonrecurring Cost (as defined below). 

EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted is defined as EBITDAC - Adjusted divided by total revenues. 

Definitions Related to Certain Components of Non-GAAP Measures 
 Acquisition/Integration Costs means the acquisition and integration costs (e.g., costs associated with regulatory filings, legal/accounting services, due diligence and the costs of integrating our information technology systems) arising out of our 

25 

acquisitions of GRP (Jersey) Holdco Limited and its business, Orchid Underwriters Agency and CrossCover Insurance Services, and BdB Limited companies, which are not considered to be normal, recurring or part of the ongoing operations. 

Foreign Currency Translation means the period-over period impact of foreign currency translation, which is calculated by applying current-year foreign exchange rates to the various functional currencies in our business to our reporting currency of U.S. dollars for the same period in the prior year. 

1Q23 Nonrecurring Cost means approximately 11.0 million expensed and substantially paid in the first quarter of 2023 to resolve a business matter, which is not considered to be normal, recurring or part of the ongoing operations. 

(Gain)/loss on disposal a caption on our consolidated statements of income which reflects net proceeds received as compared to net book value related to sales of books of business and other divestiture transactions, such as the disposal of a business through sale or closure. 

Our industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-GAAP information with respect to one or more of these measures, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments and, therefore comparability may be limited. This supplemental non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Company ' s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Acquisitions 
 Part of our business strategy is to attract high-quality insurance intermediaries and service organizations to join our operations. From 1993 through the third quarter of 2024, we acquired 664 insurance intermediary operations. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 We have had no changes to our Critical Accounting Policies as described in our most recent Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies, the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and purchase price allocations, intangible asset impairments, non-cash stock-based compensation and reserves for litigation. In particular, the accounting for these areas is subject to uncertainty because it requires significant use of judgment to be made by management. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Refer to Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for details regarding our critical and significant accounting policies.

 Commissions and Fees 
 Commissions and fees, including profit-sharing contingent commissions and earned premiums, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 106 million to 1,155 million, or 10.1 , over the same period in 2023. Core commissions and fees revenue for the third quarter of 2024 increased 106 million or 10.4 , composed of: (i) approximately 95 million of net new and renewal business, which reflects an Organic Revenue growth rate of 9.5 ; (ii) 35 million from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2023; (iii) an increase from the impact of Foreign Currency Translation of 2 million and (iv) an offsetting decrease of 26 million related to commissions and fees revenue from businesses or books of business divested in the preceding twelve months. Profit-sharing contingent commissions for the third quarter of 2024 were flat when compared to the same period in 2023. 
 27 

Commissions and fees, including profit-sharing contingent commissions and earned premiums, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 352 million to 3,545 million, or 11.0 , over the same period in 2023. Core commissions and fees revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 330 million or 10.6 , composed of: (i) approximately 284 million of net new and renewal business, which reflects an Organic Revenue growth rate of 9.4 ; (ii) 120 million from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2023; (iii) an increase from the impact of Foreign Currency Translation of 7 million and (iv) an offsetting decrease of 81 million related to commissions and fees revenue from businesses or books of business divested in the preceding twelve months. Profit-sharing contingent commissions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 22 million, or 25.0 , compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was driven primarily by (i) improved underwriting results and qualifying for certain profit-sharing contingent commissions that we did not qualify for in the prior year and (ii) recent acquisitions. 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 14 million from the same period in 2023. Investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 37 million, from the same period in 2023. The increases were primarily driven by higher average interest rates and cash balances compared to the prior year. 
 Other Income 
 Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2 million from the same period in 2023, and other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 2 million, or 50.0 , as compared to the same period in 2023. Other income consists primarily of miscellaneous income and therefore can fluctuate between comparable periods. 
 Employee Compensation and Benefits 
 Employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 51.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 49.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 14.1 , or 75 million. This increase included 20 million of compensation costs related to stand-alone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2023. Therefore, employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2024 and 2023 increased by 55 million, or 10.6 . This underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to: (i) an increase in staff costs attributable to new hires; (ii) an increase in producer compensation associated with revenue growth; (iii) an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation driven by the strong financial performance of the Company and (iv) the year-over-year increase of approximately 18 million in the value of deferred compensation liabilities driven by changes in the market prices of our deferred compensation plan, with such amount substantially offset within other operating expenses as we hold assets to fund these liabilities, partially offset by (v) employee compensation and benefits associated with businesses divested in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 50.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 50.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and increased 11.6 , or 190 million. This increase included 55 million of compensation costs related to stand-alone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2023. Therefore, employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2024 and 2023 increased by 135 million, or 8.3 . This underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to: (i) an increase in staff costs attributable to new hires; (ii) an increase in producer compensation associated with revenue growth; (iii) an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation driven by the strong financial performance of the Company and (iv) the year-over-year increase of approximately 19 million in the value of deferred compensation liabilities driven by changes in the market prices of our deferred compensation plan, with such amount substantially offset within other operating expenses as we hold assets to fund these liabilities, partially offset by (v) employee compensation and benefits associated with businesses divested in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 Other operating expenses represented 13.9 of total revenues for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 15.7 for the third quarter of 2023. Other operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 3 million, or 1.8 , from the same period of 2023. This change includes: (i) the year-over-year decrease of approximately 18 million in the value of assets held to fund the associated liabilities within our deferred compensation plan, which was substantially offset within employee compensation and benefits, as noted above and (ii) other operating expenses associated with businesses divested in the fourth quarter of 2023, offset by (iii) 8 million of other operating expenses related to stand-alone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2023; (iv) increased information technology related costs; (v) and to a lesser extent, increased variable costs associated with revenue growth. 
 Other operating expenses represented 13.8 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 15.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other operating expenses for the first nine months of 2024 increased 9 million, or 1.8 , from the same period of 2023. This change includes: (i) 24 million of other operating expenses related to stand-alone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2023; (ii) increased information technology related costs; (iii) and to a lesser extent, increased variable costs associated with revenue growth, offset by (iv) the 1Q23 Nonrecurring Cost (v) other operating expenses associated with businesses divested in the fourth quarter of 2023 and (vi) the year-over-year decrease of approximately 19 million in the value of assets held to fund the associated liabilities within our deferred compensation plan, which was substantially offset within employee compensation and benefits, as noted above. 
 28 

(Gain)/Loss on Disposal 
 Gain on disposal for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 2 million from the third quarter of 2023. Gain on disposal for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 21 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Activity for (Gain)/Loss on disposal for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to finalization of the gain associated with selling certain third-party claims administration and adjusting services businesses in the fourth quarter of 2023. Although we do not routinely sell businesses or customer accounts, we periodically sell an office or a book of business (one or more customer accounts) that we believe does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for adequate growth, or because doing so is in the Company s best interest. 
 Amortization 
 Amortization expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 4 million, or 9.8 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. Amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 8 million, or 6.5 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change reflects the amortization of new intangibles from businesses acquired within the past twelve months, net of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized or written off in the (Gain)/Loss on disposal. 
 Depreciation 
 Depreciation expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 1 million, or 10.0 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. Depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3 million, or 10.0 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Changes in depreciation expense reflect net additions of fixed assets resulting from businesses acquired in the past twelve months and the addition of fixed assets resulting from business initiatives, partially offset by the impact of fixed assets that became fully depreciated or written off in the gain or loss on disposal. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 2 million, or 4.2 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4 million, or 2.8 , compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Change in Estimated Acquisition Earn-Out Payables 
 Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 805 - Business Combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100 of the fair value of acquired assets, including goodwill, and assumed liabilities (with only limited exceptions) upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity. Additionally, the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements (such as earn-out purchase price arrangements) at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration. The recorded purchase price for acquisitions includes an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions. Subsequent changes in these earn-out obligations are required to be recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income when incurred or reasonably estimated. Estimations of potential earn-out obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities, usually for periods ranging from one to three years. 
 The net charge or credit to the Consolidated Statements of Income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earn-out payables liability, and the accretion of the present value discount on those liabilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the fair values of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables were re-evaluated based upon projected operating results and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (Level 3) as defined in ASC 820- Fair Value Measurement . The resulting net changes, as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earn-out payables were as follows:

For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of estimated earn-out payables was re-evaluated and resulted in decreases of 9 million and 15 million, respectively, which resulted in credits to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, estimated acquisition earn-out payables totaled 137 million, of which 73 million was recorded as accounts payable and 64 million was recorded as other non-current liabilities. 
 29 

Income Taxes 
 The effective tax rate on income from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 24.6 and 27.3 , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the quarter was primarily impacted by the change in the market value of Company-owned life insurance associated with our deferred compensation plan and certain prior year nonrecurring items. The effective tax rate on income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 23.1 and 23.9 , respectively.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SEGMENT INFORMATION 
 As discussed in Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we operate three reportable segments: Retail, Programs and Wholesale Brokerage. On a segmented basis, changes in amortization, depreciation and interest expenses generally result from activity associated with acquisitions. Likewise, other income consists primarily of miscellaneous income and therefore can fluctuate between comparable periods. As such, management primarily focuses on the Organic Revenue growth rate and EBITDAC Margin when evaluating the operational efficiency of a segment. 
 The reconciliation of commissions and fees included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income to Organic Revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the growth rates for Organic Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, including by segment, are as follows:

 NMF = Not a meaningful figure 
 
 The Retail segment s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.5 , or 39 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 641 million. The 40 million increase in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by: (i) approximately 16 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2023; (ii) an increase of 23 million related to net new and renewal business; and (iii) an increase from the impact of Foreign Currency Translation of 2 million. Profit-sharing contingent commissions for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 11.1 , or 1 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 8 million. This decrease was primarily the result of not qualifying for certain profit-sharing contingent commissions in 2024, due to higher loss ratios experienced by our insurance carrier partners. The Retail segment s total commissions and fees increased by 6.5 , and the Organic Revenue growth rate was 3.9 for the third quarter of 2024. The Organic Revenue growth rate was driven by net new business written during the preceding twelve months and growth on renewals of existing customers. Renewal business was impacted by timing of certain nonrecurring revenue adjustments to incentive commissions and moderating rates and exposure unit growth. 
 Income before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 7.1 , or 8 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 120 million. The primary factors driving this increase were: (i) a decrease in intercompany interest expense; (ii) a decrease in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, and (iii) the profit associated with the net increase in revenue as described above. 
 EBITDAC - Adjusted for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.6 , or 1 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 170 million. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 26.5 from 28.4 in the same period in 2023. The change in EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted was primarily driven by: (i) a decrease in profit-sharing contingent commissions, (ii) higher non-cash stock-based compensation (iii) the timing of certain nonrecurring revenue and adjustments to incentive commissions, (iv) higher compensation due to investments in employees which was partially offset by (v) the net increase in revenue as described above and (vi) leveraging our expense base. 
 35 

The Retail segment s total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 8.7 , or 167 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 2,093 million. The 175 million increase in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by: (i) approximately 55 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2023; (ii) an increase of 119 million related to net new and renewal business and (iii) an offsetting decrease of 3 million related to commissions and fees recorded in 2023 from businesses since divested. Profit-sharing contingent commissions for the nine months of 2024 decreased 25.0 , or 10 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 30 million. This decrease was primarily the result of not qualifying for certain profit-sharing contingent commissions in 2024, due to higher loss ratios experienced by our insurance carrier partners. The Retail segment s total commissions and fees increased by 8.6 , and the Organic Revenue growth rate was 6.3 for the first nine months of 2024. The Organic Revenue growth rate was driven by net new business written during the preceding twelve months and growth on renewals of existing customers. Renewal business was impacted by moderating rates and growth of exposure units. 
 Income before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 13.0 , or 56 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 488 million. The primary factors driving this increase were: (i) a decrease in intercompany interest expense; (ii) a decrease in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, and (iii) the profit associated with the net increase in revenue as described above. 
 EBITDAC - Adjusted for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5.8 , or 35 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 641 million. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 30.6 from 31.5 in the same period in 2023. The decrease in EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted was primarily driven by: (i) a decrease in profit-sharing contingent commissions and, (ii) higher non-cash stock-based compensation and (iii) higher compensation due to investments in employees, which was partially offset by, (iv) the net increase in revenue as described above and (v) leveraging our expense base. 
 Programs Segment 
 The Programs segment manages over 60 programs supported by over 100 well-capitalized carrier partners. In most cases, the insurance carriers that support these programs have delegated underwriting and, in many instances, claims-handling authority to our programs' operations. These programs are generally distributed through a nationwide network of independent agents and Brown Brown retail agents, and offer targeted products and services designed for specific industries, trade groups, professions, public entities and market niches. This segment also operates our write-your-own flood insurance carrier, WNFIC and operates two Captives. WNFIC s underwriting business consists of policies written on behalf of and fully ceded to the NFIP, as well as excess flood policies, which are fully reinsured in the private market. The Captives provide additional underwriting capacity that enable growth in core commissions and fees, and allow us to participate in underwriting results with limited exposure to claims expenses. The Company has traditionally participated in underwriting profits through profit-sharing contingent commissions. These Captives give us another way to continue to participate in underwriting results while limiting exposure to claims expenses. The Captives focus on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties underwritten by certain of our MGUs. The Captives limit the Company's exposure to claims expenses either through reinsurance or by participating in limited tranches of the underwriting risk. 
 The Programs segment operations can be grouped into five broad categories: Professional Programs, Personal Lines Programs, Commercial Programs, Public Entity-Related Programs and Specialty Programs. Approximately 76 of the Programs segment s commissions and fees revenue is commission based.

 NMF = Not a meaningful figure 
 The Programs segment s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 15.7 , or 48 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 353 million. The 51 million increase in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by: (i) approximately 17 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2023; (ii) approximately 60 million of net new business, renewal business, and fee revenues and (iii) an offsetting decrease of 26 million related to commissions and fees revenue from businesses divested in the preceding twelve months. Profit-sharing contingent commissions for the third quarter of 2024 decreased approximately 5 million as compared to the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was driven by the expected claims costs associated with Hurricane Helene. 
 The Programs segment s total commissions and fees increased by 15.3 , and the Organic Revenue growth rate was 22.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Organic Revenue growth was driven by good new business and retention as well as exposure unit expansion. 
 Income before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 33.9 , or 39 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 154 million. Income before income taxes increased due to the drivers of EBITDAC - Adjusted described below along with the decrease in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. 
 EBITDAC - Adjusted for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 25.0 , or 34 million, from the same period in 2023, to 170 million. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 48.2 from 44.6 in the same period in 2023. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted increased due to leveraging our expense base and the sale of certain third-party claims administration and adjusting services businesses in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 The Programs segment s total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 16.1 , or 140 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 1,010 million. The 105 million increase in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by: (i) approximately 
 37 

126 million of net new renewal business and fee revenues; (ii) an offsetting decrease of 79 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in the preceding twelve months and (iii) 58 million from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2023. Profit-sharing contingent commissions for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased approximately 23 million, or by 65.7 , as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was driven by qualifying for certain contingent commissions that we did not qualify for in the prior year, favorable loss ratios, prior year adjustments and acquisitions partially offset due to the impact related to expected insured losses resulting from Hurricane Helene. 
 The Programs segment s total commissions and fees increased by 14.8 , and the Organic Revenue growth rate was 16.8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Organic Revenue growth was driven primarily by strong net new business across most of our Programs and good retention, a growth incentive received for one of our programs and partially offset by nonrecurring claims revenue in the prior year. 
 Income before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 39.8 , or 125 million, from the same period in 2023, to 439 million. Income before income taxes increased due to the drivers of EBITDAC - Adjusted described below along with the gain on disposal of certain businesses. 
 EBITDAC - Adjusted for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 26.1 , or 98 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 474 million. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 46.9 from 43.2 in the same period in 2023. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted increased due to leveraging our expense base and the sale of certain third-party claims administration and adjusting services businesses in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Wholesale Brokerage Segment 
 The Wholesale Brokerage segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance, primarily through independent agents and brokers, including Brown Brown retail agents. Approximately 86 of the Wholesale Brokerage segment s commissions and fees revenue is commission based.

The 14 million net increase in core commissions and fees revenue was driven primarily by: (i) 12 million related to net new and renewal business and (ii) 2 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2023. Profit-sharing contingent commissions for the third quarter of 2024 increased 6 million compared to the third quarter of 2023, driven by improved underwriting results, increased written premium and finalization of prior year estimates of profit-sharing contingent commissions. The Wholesale Brokerage segment s growth rate for total commissions and fees was 13.4 , and the Organic Revenue growth rate was 8.4 for the third quarter of 2024. The Organic Revenue growth rate was driven by net new business and a combination of rate and exposure unit increases. 
 Income before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 133.3 , or 32 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 56 million due to: (i) the growth of EBITDAC - Adjusted described below and (ii) a decrease in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. 
 EBITDAC - Adjusted for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 17.9 , or 10 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 66 million. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 38.6 from 37.3 , as compared to the same period in 2023. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted increased due to: (i) total revenues growth and (ii) leveraging our expense base. 
 The Wholesale Brokerage segment s total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 14.6 , or 60 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 472 million. The 48 million net increase in core commissions and fees revenue was driven primarily by: (i) 39 million related to net new and renewal business; (ii) 7 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions and dispositions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2023; and (iii) an increase from the impact of Foreign Currency Translation of 1 million. Profit-sharing contingent commissions for the first nine months of 2024 increased approximately 9 million compared to the same period of 2023 driven by improved underwriting results, increased written premium, finalization of prior-year estimates and acquisitions completed in the past twelve months. The Wholesale Brokerage segment s growth rate for total commissions and fees was 13.9 , and the Organic Revenue growth rate was 9.8 for the first nine months of 2024. The Organic Revenue growth rate was driven by strong new business and good retention, as well as a combination of rate and exposure unit increases. 
 Income before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 55.9 , or 52 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 145 million due to: (i) the growth of EBITDAC - Adjusted described below and (ii) a decrease in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. 
 EBITDAC - Adjusted for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 21.2 , or 29 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, to 166 million. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 35.2 from 33.3 in the same period in 2023 due to: (i) total revenues growth; (ii) certain nonrecurring operating expenses in the prior year; and (iii) leveraging our expense base. 
 Other 
 As discussed in Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Other column in the Segment Information table includes any revenue and expenses not allocated to reportable segments, and corporate-related items, including the intercompany interest expense charges to reporting segments. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The Company seeks to maintain a conservative balance sheet and strong liquidity profile. Our capital requirements to operate as an insurance intermediary are low and we have been able to grow and invest in our business through a combination of cash that has been generated from operations, the disciplined use of debt and the issuance of equity as part of the purchase price consideration to acquire certain businesses. We have the ability to utilize our Revolving Credit Facility, which as of September 30, 2024 provided up to 800 million in available cash. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility contains an expansion option for up to an additional 500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to the approval of participating lenders. On March 31, 2022, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement") which provided term loan capacity of 800 million. Additionally, the Company may, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of additional term loan commitments by new or existing lenders, increase either Term Loan Commitment under the existing Loan Agreement or the term loans issued thereunder or issue new tranches of term loans in an aggregate additional amount of up to 400 million. Including the expansion options under all existing credit agreements, the Company has access to up to 1,700 million of incremental borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2024. 
 39 

We believe that we have access to additional funds, if needed, through the capital markets or private placements to obtain further debt financing under the current market conditions. The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investment portfolio and funds generated from operations, together with the funds available under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy its normal liquidity needs, including principal payments on our long-term debt, for at least the next twelve months and in the long-term. 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company exercised a draw down on the Revolving Credit Facility for 350 million in connection with the pending acquisition of Quintes Holding B.V. that is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024.

(1) Includes 1.0 million of future lease commitments expected to commence later in 2024. 

(2) Includes 137 million of current and non-current estimated acquisition earn-out payables. Earn-out payables for acquisitions not denominated in U.S. dollars are measured at the current foreign exchange rate. Six of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables assumed included provisions with no maximum potential earn-out amount. The amount recorded for these acquisitions as of September 30, 2024 is 4 million. The Company deems a significant increase to this amount to be unlikely. 

(3) Does not include approximately 43 million of current liability for a dividend of 0.1500 per share approved by the Board of Directors on October 23, 2024. 

Debt 
 Total debt at September 30, 2024 was 3,592 million net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, which was a decrease of 204 million compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease includes: the repayment of 800 million in senior notes and floating-rate debt balances net of Revolving Credit Facility activity and the addition of deferred financing costs and discount on debt of 7 million; offset by the issuance of 600 million senior notes and the amortization of discounted debt related to our various unsecured senior notes and debt issuance cost amortization of 3 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid 19 million of principal related to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement term loan through the quarterly scheduled principal payments. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement term loan had an outstanding balance of 200 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company's next scheduled principal payment is due in December 2024 and is equal to 6 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid 31 million of principal related to the Term Loans issued under the Term A-2 Loan Commitment Term A-2 Loans through quarterly scheduled principal payments. The Term A-2 Loans had an outstanding balance of 425 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company s next scheduled principal payment is due in December 2024 and is equal to 13 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid 150 million of principal related to the Term Loans issued under the Term A-1 Loan Commitment Term A-1 Loans ). The Term A-1 Loans had an outstanding balance of 150 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 On February 13, 2024, the Company drew down on the Revolving Credit Facility 150 million, and the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid 250 million of the outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility had no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. 
 On June 11, 2024, the Company completed the issuance of 600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.650 Senior Notes due 2034 (the 2034 Senior Notes ). The net proceeds to the Company from the issuance of the 2034 Senior Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, were approximately 593 million. The 2034 Senior Notes were given investment grade ratings of BBB- stable outlook and Baa3 positive outlook. The 2034 Senior Notes will mature in June 2034. Interest on the 2034 Senior Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears. The 2034 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Company s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The Company may redeem the 2034 Senior Notes in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, at the make whole redemption prices specified in the prospectus supplement for the 2034 Senior Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In September 2024, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the 
 40 

2034 Senior Notes to repay 500 million of the 4.200 senior notes due September 2024. In June 2024, the Company also used 100 million of the proceeds to repay a portion of an outstanding term loan balance. As of September 30, 2024 there was a total outstanding debt balance of 600 million exclusive of the associated discount balance on the 2034 Senior Notes.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk through our investments, revolving credit line, term loan agreements and international operations. 
 Our invested assets are held primarily as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, available-for-sale marketable debt securities, non-marketable debt securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury securities, and professionally managed short-term duration fixed income funds. These investments are subject to interest rate risk. The fair value of our invested assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximated their respective carrying values due to their short-term duration and therefore, such market risk is not considered to be material. 
 We do not actively invest or trade in equity securities. In addition, we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 775 million outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the Loan Agreement tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). These agreements bear interest on a floating basis and are therefore subject to changes in the associated interest expense. The effect of an immediate hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The majority of our international operations do not have material transactions in currencies other than their functional currency which would expose the Company to transactional currency rate risk. We are subject to translational exchange rate risk having businesses operating outside of the U.S. in the following functional currencies, British pounds, Canadian dollar, and euros. Based upon our foreign currency rate exposure as of September 30, 2024, an immediate 10 hypothetical change of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation (the Evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act Disclosure Controls as of September 30, 2024. Based upon the Evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our senior management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the Evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. 
 The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 CEO and CFO Certifications 
 Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 are the Certifications of the CEO and the CFO, respectively. The Certifications are supplied in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Section 302 Certifications ). This Item 4 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains the information concerning the evaluation referred to in the Section 302 Certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.
