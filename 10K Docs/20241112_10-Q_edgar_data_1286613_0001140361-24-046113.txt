MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

All references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Form 10-Q to we, our, us and the Company refer to Lincoln Educational Services Corporation and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates
 otherwise.

The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding the Company, our business, prospects, and our results of operations that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
 posed by many factors and events that could cause our actual business, prospects, and results of operations to differ materially from those that may be anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Such statements may be identified by the use
 of words such as expect, estimate, assume, believe, anticipate, may, will, forecast, outlook, plan, project, or similar words and include, without limitation, statements relating to future enrollment, revenues, revenues per
 student, earnings growth, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and the effect of pandemics and its ultimate effect on the Company s business and results. These statements are based on the Company s current expectations and are subject to a
 number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Additional factors that could cause or contribute to differences between our actual results and those anticipated include, but are not limited to, those described in the Risk Factors section of
 our Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to revise any forward-looking
 statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this Form 10-Q and in our other reports filed with the SEC that advise
 interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business.

As of January 1, 2023, the Company s business has been organized into two reportable business segments: (a) Campus Operations; and (b) Transitional. The Campus Operations segment includes campuses that are
 continuing in operation and contribute to the Company s core operations and performance. The Transitional segment refers to campuses that have been marked for closure and are being taught out. As of September
 30, 2024, no campuses were classified in the Transitional segment. During the prior year, the Company s Somerville, Massachusetts campus was classified in the Transitional segment. The campus was fully taught out as of December 31, 2023. 

We evaluate performance based on operating results. Adjustments to reconcile segment results with consolidated results are included in the caption Corporate, which primarily includes
 unallocated corporate activity. The interim financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and the discussions contained herein should be read in conjunction with
 the annual financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10-K, which includes audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the last two fiscal years ended December 31, 2023.

General

Lincoln Educational Services Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company , we , our , and us , as applicable) provide diversified career-oriented post-secondary education to
 recent high school graduates and working adults. The Company, which currently operates 22 campuses in 13 states, offers programs in skilled trades (which include HVAC, welding, computerized numerical control and electrical and electronic systems
 technology, among other programs), automotive technology, healthcare services (which include nursing, dental assistant, and medical administrative assistant, among other programs), hospitality services (which include culinary, therapeutic
 massage, cosmetology, and aesthetics), and information technology. The schools operate under Lincoln Technical Institute, Lincoln College of Technology, Lincoln Culinary Institute, Euphoria Institute of Beauty Arts Sciences, and associated
 brand names. Most of the campuses serve major metropolitan markets and each typically offers courses in multiple areas of study. Five of the campuses are destination schools, which attract students from across the United States and, in some
 cases, from abroad. The Company s other campuses primarily attract students from their local communities and surrounding areas. All of the campuses are nationally accredited and are eligible to participate in federal financial aid programs by
 the U.S. Department of Education DOE and applicable state education agencies and accrediting commissions, which allow students to apply for and access federal student loans as well as other forms of financial aid.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting
 Policies and Estimates and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Form 10-K and Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q.

Allowance for Credit Losses

On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit
 Losses on Financial Instruments, commonly known as CECL CECL . As a result of the adoption, the Company has revised the way in which it calculates reserves on outstanding student
 accounts receivable balances. Details considered by management in the estimate include the following:

We extend credit to a portion of the students who are enrolled at our academic institutions for tuition and certain other educational costs. Based upon past experience and judgment, we
 establish an allowance for credit losses with respect to student receivables which we estimate will ultimately not be collectible. Our standard student receivable allowance is based on an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for student
 receivables that considers vintages of receivables to determine a loss rate. Our estimation methodology considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors that, based on our collection experience, we believe have an impact on our
 repayment risk and ability to collect student receivables. Changes in the trends in any of these factors may impact our estimate of the allowance for credit losses. These factors include, but are not limited to: internal repayment history,
 changes in the current economic, legislative or regulatory environments, internal cash collection forecasts and the ability to complete the federal financial aid process with the student. These factors are monitored and assessed on a regular
 basis. Overall, our allowance estimation process for student receivables is validated by trending analysis and comparing estimated and actual performance.

Management makes a series of assumptions to determine what is believed to be the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses. Management determines a reasonable and supportable forecast
 based on the expectation of future conditions over a supportable forecast period, as described above, as well as qualitative adjustments based on current and future conditions that may not be fully captured in the historical modeling factors
 described above. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change.

We monitor our collections and write-off experience to assess whether or not adjustments to our allowance percentage estimates are necessary. Changes in trends in any of the factors that we
 believe impact the collection of our student receivables, as noted above, or modifications to our collection practices and other related policies may impact our estimate of our allowance for credit losses and our results from operations.

Because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from Title IV Programs, any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under Title IV Programs,
 or the ability of our students or institutions to participate in Title IV Programs, would likely have a material impact on the realizability of our receivables.

We do not believe that there is any direct correlation between tuition increases, the credit we extend to students and our financing commitments. The extended financing plans we offer to our
 students are made on a student-by-student basis and are predominantly a function of the specific student s financial condition. We only extend credit to the extent there is a financing gap between the tuition and fees charged for the program
 and the amount of grants, loans and parental loans each student receives. Each student s funding requirements are unique. Factors that determine the amount of aid available to a student include whether they are dependent or independent
 students, Pell Grants awarded, federal Direct Loans awarded, PLUS loans awarded to parents and the student s personal resources and family contributions. As a result, it is extremely difficult to predict the number of students that will need us
 to extend credit to them.

Because a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from Title IV Programs, any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under Title IV Programs or
 the ability of our students or schools to participate in Title IV Programs could have a material effect on the realizability of our receivables.

Effect of Inflation

Inflation has not had a material effect on our operations.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023

Consolidated Results of Operations

Revenue . Revenue increased 14.8 million, or 14.8 to 114.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 99.6
 million in the prior year comparable period. Revenue growth was primarily due to a 10.6 increase in average student population, driven by four consecutive quarters of double digit start growth, which was up 21.1 for the three months ended
 September 30, 2024. Included in the increase was 3.4 million of revenue generated from the recently opened East Point, Georgia campus.

Educational services
 and facilities expense. Our educational services and facilities expense increased 4.9 million, or 11.4 to 48.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 43.1 million in the prior year comparable period. This
 increase over the prior quarter includes 2.3 million in costs associated with new programs in addition to expenses related to new campuses including the recently opened East Point, Georgia campus and the new Houston, Texas campus, which is
 expected to open in the second half of 2025. Also included in this increase are costs related to the relocation of the Nashville, Tennessee and Levittown, Pennsylvania campuses, which are expected to open in the first half of 2025 and the
 second half of 2025, respectively. The remaining expense increase was driven by several factors including additional depreciation expense, resulting from increased investments in capital expenditures, an increase in books and tools expense
 driven by a 21.1 increase in student starts and increased instructional costs driven by a larger student population, which as a percentage of revenue have declined over the prior year comparable period reflecting increased operational
 efficiencies. Partially offsetting these costs was a reduction of 0.5 million resulting from the Transitional segment.

Educational services and facilities expense, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 42.0 from 43.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Selling, general
 and administrative expense. Our selling, general and administrative expense increased 8.8 million, or 16.3 to 63.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 54.5 million in the prior year comparable period. 
 Included in the increase over the prior year are approximately 3.0 million of one-time items including new campus costs and campus relocation costs. The remaining expense increases were driven by several factors including higher
 administrative costs, increased marketing investments and additional sales and student services expense. Partially offsetting these costs was a reduction of 0.4 million resulting from the Transitional segment.

Administrative costs increased 3.9 million driven by several factors including additional salary expense due to an increase in personnel combined with merit increases, increased stock-based
 compensation expense due to the acceleration of expense for certain employees, an increase in legal costs and a higher provision for credit losses driven in part by revenue growth.

23 

Index 

Marketing investments increased 0.7 million, while the costs to obtain potential students declined, demonstrating increased efficiencies per dollar spent. Additional marketing initiatives
 have contributed to the 21.1 student start growth over the prior quarter and will continue to yield returns through the end of the year.

Sales and student services expense increased 1.6 million, primarily driven by increased personnel to continue to support and drive student start growth and program expansions.

Selling, general and administrative expense, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 55.4 from 54.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Gain on insurance
 proceeds. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received gross insurance proceeds in the amount of 2.8 million relating to hail damage at one of our campuses.

Net interest expense / income. Net interest expense was 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net
 interest income of 0.9 million in the prior year comparable period. Interest income in the current period was lower than prior year by approximately 0.4 million due to higher investment amounts in combination with more favorable interest rates
 in the prior year. Interest expense increased by roughly 0.6 million in the current year resulting from two additional finance leases.

Income taxes. The provision for
 income taxes was 1.7 million and 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in tax provision was primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax income.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023

Consolidated Results of Operations

Revenue . Revenue increased 45.1 million, or 16.4 to 320.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 275.5
 million in the prior year comparable period. Revenue growth was primarily due to a 10.6 increase in average student population, driven by starting the year with approximately 9.0 or 1,100 more students combined with four consecutive quarters of
 double digit start growth, which was up 16.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Included in the increase was 5.2 million of revenue generated from the recently opened East Point, Georgia campus.

Educational services
 and facilities expense. Our educational services and facilities expense increased 15.4 million, or 12.7 to 136.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 121.2 million in the prior year comparable period. This
 increase over the prior quarter includes 7.2 million in costs associated with new programs at existing campuses in addition to expenses related to new campuses including the recently opened East Point, Georgia campus and the new Houston, Texas
 campus, which is expected to open in the second half of 2025. Also included in this increase are costs related to the relocations of the Nashville, Tennessee and Levittown, Pennsylvania campuses, which are expected to open in the first half of
 2025 and the second half of 2025, respectfully. The remaining expense increase was driven by several factors including additional depreciation expense, resulting from increased investments in capital expenditures, an increase in books and
 tools expense driven by a 16.6 increase in student starts and increased instructional costs driven by a larger student population, which as a percentage of revenue have declined over the prior year comparable period reflecting increased
 operational efficiencies. Partially offsetting these costs was a reduction of 1.6 million resulting from the Transitional segment.

Educational services and facilities expense, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 42.6 from 44.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Selling, general and
 administrative expense. Our selling, general and administrative expense increased 25.1 million, or 16.0 to 181.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 156.6 million in the prior year comparable period. 
 Included in the increase over the prior year are approximately 2.4 million of one-time items including new campus costs and campus relocation costs. The remaining expense increases were driven by several factors including higher
 administrative costs, increased marketing investments and additional sales and student services expense. Partially offsetting these costs was a reduction of 1.3 million resulting from the Transitional segment.

Administrative costs increased 16.1 million driven by several factors including additional salary expense due to an increase in personnel combined with merit increases and a higher provision
 for credit losses driven in part by revenue growth. Partially offsetting the costs increases were reduced stock-based compensation expense and legal fees.

Marketing investments increased 2.6 million, while the costs to obtain potential students declined, demonstrating increased efficiencies per dollar spent. Additional marketing initiatives
 have contributed to the 16.6 student start growth over the prior quarter and will continue to yield returns through the end of the year.

24 

Index 

Sales expense and student services increased 5.2 million, primarily driven by increased personnel to continue to support and drive student start growth and program expansions.

Selling, general and administrative expense, as a percentage of revenue, decreased slightly to 56.7 from 56.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Gain on insurance
 proceeds. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received gross insurance proceeds in the amount of 2.8 million relating to hail damage at one of our campuses.

Impairment of
 goodwill and long-lived assets. Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets of 4.2 million in the prior year was the result of the sale of the Nashville, Tennessee property. The result of the sale created a change in the
 trajectory of the fair value of the Nashville, Tennessee operations and as such, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of 3.8 million related to goodwill and an additional 0.4 million impairment related to long-lived
 assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets.

Net interest expense
 / income. Net interest expense was 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to interest income of 1.8 million in the prior year. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
 remained essentially flat, with an increase in interest expense in the current year resulting from two additional finance leases.

Income taxes. The provision for
 income taxes was 1.1 million and 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in provision was primarily driven by a gain in the prior year due to the sale of the Nashville, Tennessee property
 during the second quarter of 2023, which drove an increase in the Company s pre-tax income.

Segment Results of Operations 

Since January 1, 2023, the Company s business has been organized into two reportable business segments: (a) Campus Operations; and (b) Transitional. These segments are defined below:

Campus Operations The Campus Operations segment includes all campuses that are continuing in
 operation and contribute to the Company s core operations and performance. 

Transitional The Transitional segment refers to campuses that have been marked for closure and are being taught out. As of
 September 30, 2024, no campuses were classified in the Transitional segment. During the prior year, the Company s Somerville, Massachusetts campus was classified in the Transitional segment. The campus was fully taught out as of December 31,
 2023.

We evaluate performance based on operating results. Adjustments to reconcile segment results with consolidated results are included in the caption Corporate, which primarily includes unallocated corporate
 activity.

Campus Operations 

Operating income increased 3.0 million, or 25.0 to 14.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 11.9 million in the prior year comparable period. The change
 quarter-over-quarter was mainly driven by the following factors:

Revenue increased 14.9 million, or 15.0 to 114.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 99.5 million in the prior year comparable period. Revenue growth was
 primarily due to a 10.7 increase in average student population, driven by four consecutive quarters of double digit start growth, which was up 21.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Included in the increase was 3.4
 million of revenue generated from the recently opened East Point, Georgia campus.

Our educational services and facilities expense increased 5.4 million, or 12.6 to 48.0 million for the three months
 ended September 30, 2024 from 42.6 million in the prior year comparable period. This increase over the prior quarter includes 2.3 million in costs associated with new programs in addition to expenses related to new campuses
 including the recently opened East Point, Georgia campus and the new Houston, Texas campus, which is expected to open in the second half of 2025. Also included in this increase are costs related to the relocation of the Nashville,
 Tennessee and Levittown, Pennsylvania campuses, which are expected to open in the first half of 2025 and the second half of 2025, respectively. The remaining expense increase was driven by several factors including additional
 depreciation expense, resulting from increased investments in capital expenditures, an increase in books and tools expense driven by a 21.1 increase in student starts and increased instructional costs driven by a larger student
 population, which as a percentage of revenue has declined over the prior year comparable period reflecting increased operational efficiencies. Partially offsetting these costs was a reduction of 0.5 million resulting from the
 Transitional segment.

26 

Index 

Our selling, general and administrative expense increased 6.6 million, or 14.5 to 51.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 44.9 million in the prior year comparable
 period. Included in the increase over the prior year was approximately 1.5 million of expenses related primarily to the recently opened East Point, Georgia campus. The remaining expense increases were driven by higher
 administrative costs, marketing investments and sales and student services expense, all of which are discussed above in the Consolidated Results of Operations.

Transitional 

On November 3, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a plan to close the Somerville, Massachusetts campus. The owner of the Somerville property exercised an option to terminate the lease on
 December 8, 2023 and the Company determined not to pursue relocating the campus in this geographic region. The campus was fully taught out as of December 31, 2023 and did not generate any expense for the current quarter.

Revenue decreased 0.1 million, or 100.0 to zero for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 0.1 million in the prior year comparable period.

Total operating expenses decreased 0.8 million, or 100.0 to zero for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 0.8 million in the prior year comparable period.

The change in operating performance was the result of closing the campus and no longer enrolling new students.

Corporate and Other 

This category includes unallocated expense incurred on behalf of the entire Company. Corporate and other expense was 9.0 million
 and 9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Included in the current year is a gain of 2.8 million related to insurance proceeds received as a result of hail damage at one of our campuses. Partially
 offsetting the gain are additional expenses relating to salaries and benefits expense, increased stock-based incentives and legal costs.

Campus Operations 

Operating income increased 40.7 , or 10.6 million to 36.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 26.2 million in the prior year comparable period. The change
 year-over-year was mainly driven by the following factors:

Revenue increased 46.6 million, or 17.0 to 320.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 274.1 million in the prior year comparable period. Revenue growth was
 primarily due to a 11.4 increase in average student population, driven by starting the year with approximately 9.0 or 1,100 more students combined with four consecutive quarters of double digit start growth, which was up 16.6 for the
 nine months ended September 30, 2024. Included in the increase was 5.2 million of revenue generated from the recently opened East Point, Georgia campus.

Our educational services and facilities expense increased 16.9 million, or 14.2 to 136.6 million for the nine months
 ended September 30, 2024 from 119.7 million in the prior year comparable period. This increase over the prior quarter includes 7.2 million in costs associated with new programs at existing campuses in addition to expenses related
 to new campuses including the recently opened East Point, Georgia campus and the new Houston, Texas campus, which is expected to open in the second half of 2025. Also included in this increase are costs related to the relocation of
 the Nashville, Tennessee and Levittown, Pennsylvania campuses, which are expected to open in the first half of 2025 and the second half of 2025, respectfully. The remaining expense increase was driven by several factors including
 additional depreciation expense, resulting from increased investments in capital expenditures, an increase in books and tools expense driven by a 16.6 increase in student starts and increased instructional costs driven by a larger
 student population, which as a percentage of revenue have declined over the prior year comparable period reflecting increased operational efficiencies.

Our selling, general and administrative expense increased 22.6 million, or 18.2 to 146.6 million for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2024, from 124.0 million in the prior year comparable period. Included in the increase over the prior year was approximately 4.0 million of expenses related primarily to the recently opened East
 Point, Georgia campus. The remaining expense increases were driven by higher administrative costs, marketing investments and sales expense and student services expense, all of which are discussed above in the Consolidated Results
 of Operations.

Transitional 

On November 3, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a plan to close the Somerville, Massachusetts campus. The owner of the Somerville property exercised the option to terminate the lease on
 December 8, 2023 and the Company determined not to pursue relocating the campus in this geographic region. The campus was fully taught out as of December 31, 2023 and did not generate any expense for the current year.

Revenue decreased 1.5 million, or 100.0 to zero for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.5 million in the prior year comparable period.

Total operating expenses decreased 2.9 million, or 100.0 to zero for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.9 million in the prior year comparable period.

The change in operating performance is the result of closing the campus and no longer enrolling new students.

Corporate and Other 

This category includes unallocated expense incurred on behalf of the entire Company. Corporate and other expense were 32.6 million
 and 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Included in the current year is a gain of 2.8 million related to insurance proceeds received as a result of hail damage at one of our campuses. Prior year
 includes a 30.9 million gain on sale of assets resulting from the sale of the Nashville, Tennessee property. The increase in expense was primarily driven by additional
 salaries and benefits expense, partially offset by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense driven by a cumulative catch-up of expense in the prior year in addition to reduced legal costs in the current year. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our primary capital requirements are for the maintenance and expansion of our facilities and the development of new programs. Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by
 operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility with Fifth Third Bank, National Association. The following chart summarizes the principal elements of our cash flow for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 54.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to 80.3 million in cash and cash
 equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31, 2023. The change in cash position from the end of the year was driven in part by the payment of incentive compensation during the first quarter and investments in capital expenditures related
 to our recently opened East Point, Georgia campus, the new Houston Texas campus, the relocations of the Nashville, Tennessee and Levittown, Pennsylvania campuses, and new programs and program expansions. Further, the prior year cash position
 benefited from 33.3 million in proceeds resulting from the sale of our Nashville, Tennessee property.

On May 24, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program of up to 30.0 million of the Company s outstanding Common Stock. The share
 repurchase program was authorized for 12 months. On February 27, 2023, the Board of Directors extended the share repurchase program for an additional 12 months and authorized the repurchase of an additional 10.0 million of the Company s Common
 Stock, for an aggregate of up to 30.6 million in additional repurchases.

On May 7, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized an extension of its share repurchase program for an additional 12 months through May 24, 2025. During the three
 and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any additional shares. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 29.7 million remaining for repurchase under the program.

Our primary source of cash is tuition collected from our students. The majority of students enrolled at our schools rely on funds
 received under various government-sponsored student financial aid programs to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education-related expenses. The most significant source of student financing is Title IV Programs, which
 represented approximately 81 of our cash receipts related to revenues in 2023. Pursuant to applicable regulations, students must apply for a new loan for each academic period. Federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements of funds
 under Title IV Programs and loan funds are generally provided by lenders in two disbursements for each academic year. The first disbursement is usually received approximately 31 days after the start of a student s academic year and the second
 disbursement is typically received at the beginning of the sixteenth week from the start of the student's academic year. Certain types of grants and other funding are not subject to a 31-day delay. In certain instances, if a student withdraws
 from a program prior to a specified date, any paid but unearned tuition or prorated Title IV Program financial aid is refunded according to federal, state and accrediting agency standards.

As a result of the significant amount of Title IV Program funds received by our students, we are highly dependent on these funds to operate our business. Any reduction in the level of Title IV
 Program funds that our students are eligible to receive for tuition payments to us or any restriction on our eligibility to receive Title IV Program funds would have a significant impact on our operations and our financial condition. For more
 information, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Industry of our Form 10-K..

Operating Activities

Operating cash flow results primarily from cash received from our students, offset by changes in working capital demands. Working capital can vary at any point in time based on several factors
 including seasonality, timing of cash receipts and payments and vendor payment terms.

Net cash used in operating activities was 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash provided by operating activities of 3.6 million in the prior year
 comparable period. The decrease in cash position was primarily related to a higher accounts receivable balance due to the timing of cash receipts and Title IV disbursements, partially offset by an decrease in prepaid expenses representing a 4.8
 million cash inflow and a 2.5 million increase in accounts payable, representing a cash inflow driven by the timing of vendor payments.

Index 

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was 22.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.0 million in the prior year comparable period. The prior year s cash
 position benefited from several factors including the sale of the Nashville, Tennessee property and proceeds received from short-term investments. Partially offsetting these cash inflows was the purchase of additional short-term investments.

We currently lease all of our campuses.

Capital expenditures were approximately 11.0 of revenues in 2023 and are expected to approximate 18.0 of revenues in 2024. The significant increase in planned capital expenditures over the
 prior year will be driven by several factors that include, but are not limited to, the buildout of our recently opened East Point, Georgia campus and the new Nashville, Tennessee campus, additional space, the planned introduction of three new
 programs at the Lincoln, Rhode Island campus, and the anticipated introduction of new programs at certain other campuses. We expect to fund future capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and cash on hand.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3.1 million and 2.9 million,
 respectively. The increase in cash used was primarily driven by cash outflows in the current year of 1.2 million related to the tax impact for vested stock grants, 0.5 million paid for implementing the new credit facility with Fifth Third
 Bank, National Association, and 0.2 million related to lease payments made under the Company s two additional finance leases. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was a 0.8 million inflow for a tenant allowance related to one of the
 Company s finance leases in the current year. The prior year also had 0.9 million in cash outflows related to the Company s share repurchase plan.

Credit Facility

On February 16, 2024, the Company entered into a secured credit agreement (the Fifth Third Credit Agreement with Fifth Third Bank, National Association (the Bank ), pursuant to which the
 Company, as borrower, obtained a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of 40.0 million including a 10.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a 20.0 million accordion feature (the Facility ), the proceeds of which are to
 be used for working capital, general corporate and certain other permitted purposes. The Facility is guaranteed by the Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries and is secured by a first priority lien in favor of the Bank on substantially all of the
 personal property owned by the Company and its subsidiaries. The term of the Facility is 36 months, maturing on February 16, 2027.

Each advance under the Facility will bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the date when made at an interest rate determined at the election of the Company at either
 the Tranche Rate (which is the forward-looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for one or three months), or the Base Rate (which is a variable per annum rate, as of any date of determination, equal to the Bank s Prime Rate), plus an
 Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margin is determined pursuant to a Pricing Grid, which for loans subject to the Tranche Rate varies from 1.75 to 2.50 and for loans subject to the Base Rate varies from 0.75 to 1.50 . The Applicable Margin
 may change quarterly based on the Total Leverage Ratio at such time. The Total Leverage Ratio is determined with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for an applicable quarterly period by dividing the aggregate
 principal amount of various forms of borrowed indebtedness as of the last day of a determination period by EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for such period. Interest is paid in arrears, either
 quarterly or monthly depending on the Company s interest rate election, with the principal due at maturity.

Under the terms of the Fifth Third Credit Agreement, the Company will pay to the Bank an unused facility fee on the average daily unused balance of the Facility at a rate per annum equal to
 0.50 , which fee is payable in arrears on dates when interest is due and payable. The Company will also pay to the Bank a letter of credit fee equal to the Applicable Margin for loans subject to the Tranche Rate multiplied by the maximum amount
 available to be drawn under such letter of credit.

The Fifth Third Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, as well as events of default customary for facilities of this type. In
 connection with the Fifth Third Credit Agreement, the Company paid the Bank a closing fee in the amount of 200,000 and other customary fees and reimbursements.

30 

Index 

On July 18, 2024, the Company entered into a first amendment of the Fifth Third Credit Agreement the Amendment ). Among other things, the Amendment contains certain
 modifications to (i) clarify certain representations and affirmative covenants of the Company, (ii) clarify certain conditions to each advance, (iii) clarify and/or replace certain events of default and (iv) delete or revise certain definitions
 in order to harmonize them with the other modifications made. The Amendment also contains customary releases, representations and warranties and reaffirmations consistent with the original terms of the Fifth Third Credit Agreement

As of September 30, 2024, there was no debt outstanding under the Facility.

Contractual Obligations

Current portion of Long-Term Debt, Long-Term Debt and Lease Commitments. As of September 30, 2024, we had no debt outstanding. We
 lease offices, educational facilities and various items of equipment for varying periods through the year 2045 at basic annual rental rates (excluding taxes, insurance, and other expenses under certain leases).

As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding loan principal commitments to our active students of 38.4 million. These are institutional loans and no cash is advanced to students. The full
 loan amount is not guaranteed unless the student completes the program. The institutional loans are considered commitments because the students are required to fund their education using these funds and they are not reported on our financial
 statements.

Regulatory Updates 

Negotiated Rulemaking . The DOE has initiated and engaged in rulemaking which has included negotiated rulemaking meetings held in
 late 2023 and early 2024 on several topics including state authorization, accreditation, return of unearned Title IV Program funds for students who withdraw from school without completing their educational programs, cash management, distance
 education, and student debt relief. See 10-K at Part I, Item 1. Business Regulatory Environment Negotiated Rulemaking, Business Regulatory Environment State Authorization, Business Regulatory Environment Accreditation, and
 Business Regulatory Environment Return of Title IV Program Funds. 

On July 17, 2024, the DOE announced that it does not plan to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking on state authorization,
 accreditation, and cash management topics until 2025. On July 24, 2024, the DOE published a notice of proposed rulemaking on topics including distance education and return of Title IV funds; however, the DOE did not publish final regulations
 by November 1, 2024, for those rules to take effect by July 1, 2025. The DOE also announced its intention to conduct negotiated rulemaking at a date to be determined to consider regulations related to third-party servicers on topics including,
 for example, the definition of third-party servicers, audit requirements for servicers, an application process for servicers, and reporting, financial, past performance, and other compliance requirements. The DOE also announced that it plans
 to issue no sooner than late 2024 revised guidance on how institutions of higher education may compensate their recruiters. See 10-K at Part I, Item 1. Business - Regulatory Environment Restrictions on payment of Commissions, Bonuses and
 Other Incentive Payments. We cannot predict the timing and scope of any regulations or guidance the DOE might issue on the forementioned topics, but new regulations or guidance on these or other topics could have a significant impact on our
 business and results of operations.

The DOE also published two sets of proposed regulations on April 17, 2024, and October 31, 2024, that would, among other things,
 specify the DOE s discretionary authority to waive the requirement for borrowers to repay some or all their Title IV federal student loans. The reasons for such waivers would include, for example, different scenarios involving schools or
 programs that close or lose Title IV eligibility or different types of borrower hardship including, among many other examples, attendance at certain types and levels of institutions (which the DOE has indicated could include for-profit
 institutions like our schools). The DOE has not published final regulations in connection with either of the aforementioned sets of proposed regulations and is in the process of receiving public comments through December 2, 2024, to the
 proposed regulations that were published on October 31, 2024. We cannot predict the timing and scope of any final regulations the DOE might issue, but new regulations on these topics could have a significant impact on our business and results
 of operations.

Planned Sale of Las Vegas, Nevada Campus

Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, the board of directors approved a plan to sell the assets related to its Las Vegas, Nevada campus
 operated under Euphoria Institute of Beauty Arts Sciences Euphoria ). The Company is in discussions with a prospective purchaser and expects to enter into a signed agreement prior to year-end. While the proposed transaction will not be
 material, it is expected that, for regulatory purposes, the transaction will be a school closure by Lincoln. There are currently approximately 300 students enrolled in programs at Euphoria and it is further expected that enrolled students would
 be permitted to transfer to the purchaser-operated school post-closing and continue their programs such that the sale should not have a significant impact on the student experience. In the fourth quarter, net assets of Euphoria will be
 classified on the balance sheet as assets held for sale and the related statement of operations information will be classified in the Transitional segment. 

The DOE has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not be treated as a change in ownership and, instead, it will be treated as the
 closure of Euphoria and the establishment of a new location by the purchaser at the site of Euphoria. Although the parties intend to work toward enabling our current students at the Las Vegas, Nevada campus to complete their programs with the
 purchaser, certain current and former students could qualify for closed school loan discharges if they do not continue and complete their programs and, in turn, the DOE could impose liabilities and other sanctions on us based on any such closed
 school loan discharges. Also, we will be required to comply with other DOE, state, and accreditor requirements associated with the transaction, the transfer of the site, and the teaching of current students. Based on current discussions, the
 transaction is currently expected to close in January, 2025, subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions.

31 

Index 

Seasonality

Our revenue and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to changes in total student population. Student
 population varies due to new student enrollments, graduations and student attrition. Historically, our schools have had lower student populations in our first and second quarters and we have experienced larger class starts in the third quarter
 and higher student attrition in the first half of the year. The growth that we generally experience in the second half of the year is largely dependent on a successful high school recruiting season. We recruit high school students several months
 ahead of their scheduled start dates and, as a consequence, while we have visibility on the number of students who have expressed interest in attending our schools, we cannot predict with certainty the actual number of new student enrollments in
 any given year and the related impact on revenue. Our expenses, however, typically do not vary significantly over the course of the year with changes in our student population and revenue.
