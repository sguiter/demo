 of the Company s segments for the Current Quarter, Prior Quarter, Current Period and Prior Period: The vast majority of Water Services and Chemical Technologies customer agreements are short-term, lasting less than one year. Water Infrastructure contains both short-term and long-term agreements. Contracts are seldom combined together as virtually all of our customer agreements constitute separate performance obligations. Each job is typically distinct, thereby not interdependent or interrelated with other customer agreements. Most contracts allow either party to terminate at any time without substantive penalties. If the customer terminates the contract, the Company is unconditionally entitled to the payments for the services rendered and products delivered to date. Contract terminations before the end of the agreement are rare. Sales returns are rare and no sales return assets have been recognized on the balance sheet. There are minimal volume discounts. There are no service-type warranties. There is no long-term customer financing. Taxes assessed by government authorities included on customer invoices are excluded from revenue. 
 In the Water Services and Water Infrastructure segments, performance obligations arise in connection with services provided to customers in accordance with contractual terms, in an amount the Company expects to collect. Services are generally sold based upon customer orders or contracts with customers that include fixed or determinable prices. Revenues are generated by services rendered and measured based on the output generated, which is usually simultaneously received and consumed by customers at their job sites. As a multi-job site organization, contract terms, including the pricing for the Company s services, are negotiated on a job site level on a per-job basis. Most jobs are completed in a short period of time, usually between one day and one month. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations are completed on a daily, hourly or per-unit basis with unconditional rights to consideration for services rendered reflected as accounts receivable trade, net of allowance for credit losses. In cases where a prepayment is received before the Company satisfies its performance obligations, a contract liability is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Final billings generally occur once all of the proper approvals are obtained. Mobilization and demobilization are factored into the pricing for services. Billings and costs related to mobilization and demobilization are not material for customer agreements that start in one period and end in another. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had revenue-producing contracts lasting over one year that include enforceable rights and obligations to fall within the scope of the model in the ASC 606 standard. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the

 contract assets or contract liabilities and contract liabilities converted to revenue during the Current or Prior Periods. Accommodations and rentals revenue is included in the Water Services segment and the Company accounts for accommodations and rentals agreements as an operating lease. The Company recognizes revenue from renting equipment on a straight-line basis. Accommodations and rental contract periods are generally daily, weekly or monthly. The average lease term is less than three months and as of September 30, 2024, there were no material rental agreements in effect lasting more than one year. During the Current Quarter, Prior Quarter, Current Period and Prior Period, approximately million, million, million and million, respectively, of accommodations and rentals revenue was accounted for under ASC 842 lease guidance. In the Chemical Technologies segment, the typical performance obligation is to provide a specific quantity of chemicals to customers in accordance with the customer agreement in an amount the Company expects to collect. Products and services are generally sold based upon customer orders or contracts with customers that include fixed or determinable prices. Revenue is recognized as the customer takes title to chemical products in accordance with the agreement. Products may be provided to customers in packaging or delivered to the customers containers through a hose. In some cases, the customer takes title to the chemicals upon consumption from storage containers on their property, where the chemicals are considered inventory until customer usage. In cases where the Company delivers products and recognizes revenue before collecting payment, the Company has an unconditional right to payment reflected in accounts receivable trade, net of allowance for credit losses. Customer returns are rare and immaterial and there were no material in-process customer agreements for this segment as of September 30, 2024, lasting greater than one year.

The second of the Tax Receivable Agreements, which the Company entered into with an affiliate of Legacy Owner Holdco and Crestview GP, generally provides for the payment by the Company to such TRA Holders of of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax that the Company actually realizes (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances in periods after the Select 144A Offering as a result of, as applicable to each such TRA Holder, (i) any net operating losses available to the Company as a result of certain reorganization transactions entered into in connection with the Select 144A Offering and (ii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by the Company as a result of any payments the Company makes under such Tax Receivable Agreement. On June 23, 2023, the Tax Receivable Agreements were amended to replace references to one year LIBOR with references to the 12-month term SOFR published by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited plus basis points, which is the benchmark replacement rate and additional margin that, under the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021, would have otherwise been inserted in place of references to LIBOR in the Tax Receivable Agreements following June 30, 2023. The Company has recognized a liability associated with the Tax Receivable Agreements of million as of both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, because the likelihood of a payment to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreements has been determined to be probable as of both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The recognized liability associated with the Tax Receivable Agreements represents of the net cash savings in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that the Company anticipates realizing in future years from certain increases in tax basis and other tax attributes arising from the Company s completed acquisitions of SES Holdings LLC Units from the TRA Holders and from the net operating losses available to the Company as a result of certain reorganization transactions entered into in connection with the Select 144A Offering.

 U.S. federal income tax rate due to net income allocated to noncontrolling interests, state income taxes and permanent book tax differences. The increase in our effective tax rate in the Current Quarter and Current Period compared to the Prior Quarter and Prior Period is due to a release of a portion of the valuation allowance on the Company s deferred tax assets at the end of 2023. Deferred income tax expense (benefit) ) ) Total income tax expense Effective Tax Rate We regularly review our deferred tax assets for realization and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Historically, we have maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence in determining whether realization of the tax benefit is more likely than not. This evidence includes historical income / loss, projected future income, the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company evaluated all available positive and negative evidence and determined that million of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2023, associated with deferred tax assets should be released because the Company believed that it had become more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized. In the Company's evaluation of the need for and amount of a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, the Company placed the most weight on objectively verifiable direct evidence, including its recent and historical operating results and the significant improvement in its operating profitability. The specific positive factors and evidence considered in the realizability of its deferred tax assets included the cumulative pre-tax income that the Company generated over the past three-year period and the expectation of income in future periods. The release of the valuation allowance resulted in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to deferred income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management has continued to assess both positive and negative evidence and determined that no further adjustments to the remaining valuation allowance were necessary as of September 30, 2024.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report, as well as the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2024 (our 2023 Form 10-K ). This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors as described under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and other cautionary statements described under the heading Risk Factors included in our 2023 Form 10-K and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements. This discussion relates to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (the Current Quarter and the Current Period , respectively) and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (the Prior Quarter and the Prior Period , respectively). Overview We are a leading provider of sustainable water-management and chemical solutions to the energy industry in the U.S. As a leader in the water solutions industry, we place the utmost importance on safe, environmentally responsible management of oilfield water throughout the lifecycle of a well. Additionally, we believe that responsibly managing water resources through our operations to help conserve and protect the environment in the communities in which we operate is paramount to our continued success. Sustainability Select is committed to a corporate strategy that supports the long-term viability of our business model in a manner that focuses on all stakeholders, including our people, our customers, the environment, and the communities in which we operate. We believe this focus will help us and our customers achieve their short-term and long-term environmental, social and governance ESG goals, help us attract and retain top talent, and further our efforts to generate investor returns. We believe our commitment to foster a culture of corporate responsibility is an important part of being a company with operations spanning the contiguous U.S. Further, we believe being a good corporate steward is strategic to our growth in the energy industry and will better allow us to develop solutions that both address the needs of our customers and contribute to sustainable business practices. As a service company, we compete with other service providers based on various factors, including safety and operational performance, technological innovation, process efficiencies and reputational awareness. We have identified the following four priorities as part of our comprehensive corporate responsibility initiative: Environmental Consciousness, Health and Safety, Human Capital Management and Community Outreach. We believe there is a strong link between these corporate responsibility initiatives and our ability to provide value to our stakeholders. We are one of the few public companies whose primary focus is on the management of water and water logistics in the energy industry with a focus on driving efficient, environmentally responsible, and economical solutions that lower costs throughout the lifecycle of the well. We believe water is a valuable resource and understand that the energy industry as well as other industries and the general public are competing for this resource. As a company, we continue to provide access to water as demanded by our customers and have significantly increased our focus on the recycling and reuse of produced water, as well as assessing other industrial water sources, to meet the industry s water demand and align our operations with the goals of our customers. We have invested significantly in the development and acquisition of fixed and mobile recycling facilities that support the advancement of commercialized produced water reuse solutions. By doing so, we strive to reduce the amount of produced water being reinjected into SWDs and to reduce our usage of fresh water as well as that of our customers. We view our rather unique position as an opportunity to strategically transform water management by leveraging our Chemical Technologies business to develop produced water

 management solutions that increase our customers ability to reuse this produced water and add value to their operations. By implementing our innovative approach to water solutions, Select has become a leader in recycling produced water to be reused for energy production. Our strong company culture includes commitments to all stakeholders, and we aim to create a work environment that fosters a diverse and inclusive company culture. Additionally, we prioritize safety in our operations through rigorous training, structured protocols and ongoing automation of our operations. Our prioritization of safety includes a commitment to safeguarding the communities in which we operate. We believe that proper alignment of our management and our board of directors with our shareholders is critical to creating long-term value, including the alignment of management compensation and incentive structures and the continued leadership of an experienced, diverse and independent board of directors. Recent Developments In the first nine months of 2024, Select executed six strategic business combinations totaling 148.1 million, and six asset acquisitions totaling 11.8 million, enhancing current and future water infrastructure capabilities. The Trinity Acquisition added strategic saltwater disposal wells and pipelines in the Permian Basin. The Bobcat Acquisition enhanced disposal operations and provided comprehensive produced water solutions in the Marcellus/Utica region. The Buckhorn Acquisition expanded solids management services by adding landfills in North Dakota and Montana. The additions of Iron Mountain Energy and Tri-State Water Logistics strengthened fluids and solids treatment and disposal assets in the Haynesville region. Finally, the Rockies infrastructure acquisition improved water disposal operations in that region. These strategic acquisitions collectively position Select for future growth and operational efficiency in the water infrastructure segment. Select is prioritizing investments in water infrastructure projects, which often bring a more predictable and steady revenue stream through long-term contracts and production-related operations. These investments typically produce higher gross margins and also foster stronger partnerships with customers, as Select becomes an integral partner in ensuring well productivity for ongoing customer production over the life of a well. Our focus is on integrated solutions that enhance contracted infrastructure projects with logistics services and chemical solutions, and expanding the value we provide to our customers. Our approach, historically and during the Current Period, has been to streamline operations and offer a more comprehensive and valuable overall package to customers that is built around optimizing the entire water lifecycle as such integrated solutions drive revenue growth and enhance overall value to clients. The armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia continued into 2024, as well as the sustained conflict in Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East, including escalating tensions with Iran, Lebanon and Yemen. As a result of the Russian invasion of the Ukraine, the U.S., the United Kingdom, the member states of the European Union and other public and private actors have imposed severe sanctions on Russian financial institutions, businesses and individuals. In October 2023, Hamas militants conducted attacks in Israel and an armed conflict has ensued between Israel and Hamas. The ensuing conflict has resulted in increased hostilities and instability in oil and gas producing regions in the Middle East as well as in key adjacent shipping lanes and supply chains, including attacks on Israel by, and elevated tensions with, Iran, a major oil producer. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the resulting sanctions and concerns regarding global energy security, has contributed to, and the conflict in the Israel-Gaza region and any heightened hostilities and political changes or instabilities in the Middle East may contribute to, increases and volatility in the prices for oil and natural gas. Such volatility, coupled with an increased cost of capital, due, in part to elevated rates of inflation and interest rates, may lead to a more difficult investing and planning environment for us and our customers. The ultimate geopolitical and macroeconomic consequences of these conflicts and associated sanctions and/or international responses cannot be predicted, and such events, or any further hostilities elsewhere, could severely impact the world economy and may adversely affect our financial condition. An end to these conflicts and an easing or elimination of the related sanctions and/or international response could result in a significant fall in commodity prices as hydrocarbons become more readily accessible in global markets, which could have an adverse effect on our customers, and therefore adversely affect our

 customers demand for our services. An intensification of that conflict could also have an adverse effect on our customers and their demand for our services. In addition, OPEC+ countries instituted an aggregate volume cut of 3.66 million barrels per day from 2021 to April 2023, and a number of other production cuts or extensions have since followed. For example, OPEC+ has announced the extension of the 3.66 million barrels per day production cut through the end of 2025. In addition, on September 5, 2024, OPEC+ announced the extension of voluntary output cuts totaling approximately 2.2 million barrels per day through December 1, 2024. Although OPEC+ has previously increased its output in December 2023, OPEC+ may, at its discretion, continue to decrease, or increase, production, which will continue to impact crude oil and natural gas price volatility. The actions of OPEC+ countries with respect to oil production levels and announcements of potential changes in such levels, including agreement on and compliance with production targets, may result in volatility in the industry in which we and our customers operate. The average price of West Texas Intermediate WTI crude oil decreased in the Current Quarter versus the Prior Quarter primarily due to concerns about weakening global demand coupled with expectation of oversupply, including growing production from countries that operate outside of OPEC quotas, such as Libya. During the Current Quarter, the average spot price of WTI crude oil was 76.43 versus an average price of 82.25 for the Prior Quarter. The average Henry Hub natural gas spot price during the Current Quarter was 2.11 versus an average of 2.59 for the Prior Quarter. Henry Hub natural gas price levels in the Current Quarter have declined relative to the Prior Quarter and have negatively impacted activity levels in natural gas basins. Additionally, increased inflation in recent years has resulted in higher interest rates and increased cost of capital for Select and for our customers. As costs of capital has increased, many of our customers have demonstrated their resolve to manage their capital spending within budgets and cash flow from operations and increase redemptions of debt and/or returns of capital to investors. Additionally, consolidation among our customers, such as the consolidation of E P companies in the Permian Basin, can disrupt our market in the near term and the resulting demand for our services. Overall however, even though commodity prices have moderated recently, the financial health of the oil and gas industry is in a generally healthy position overall, including many of our customers specifically, as reflected in revenues and earnings, debt metrics, recent capital raises, and equity valuations . When one customer acquires another, drilling and completions activity levels may decrease overall, but acquisitions can lead to larger blocks of consolidated development and production acreage, which can increase the demand for our longer-term integrated full water lifecycle solutions. This consolidation may streamline operations, as Select can offer integrated solutions to clients with larger water volumes to manage in certain areas. The Company's position in the market may strengthen, as it becomes an essential partner for long-term production integrity in larger, more comprehensive water projects. However, it also means Select must meet the changing needs and structures of these consolidated entities to maintain and grow these relationships. While customers involved in acquisitions may initially slow activity to focus on integration and portfolio management, we believe we are well-positioned to meet the increased responsibilities of overall water management, including water reuse, recycling, transmitting and balancing across customers and regions, and ultimately disposal, for these larger customers and blocks of contiguous acreage. While the financial health of the broader oil and gas industry has shown improvement as compared to prior periods, central bank policy actions and associated liquidity risks and other factors may negatively impact the value of our equity and that of our customers, and may reduce our and their ability to access liquidity in the bank and capital markets or result in capital being available on less favorable terms, which could negatively affect our financial condition and that of our customers. From an operational standpoint, many of the recent trends still apply to ongoing unconventional oil and gas development. The continued trend towards multi-well pad development and simultaneous well completions, executed within a limited time frame, combined with service price inflation and elevated interest rates, has increased the overall intensity, complexity and cost of well completions, while increasing fracturing efficiency and the use of lower-cost in-basin sand has decreased total costs for our customers. However, we note the continued efficiency gains in the well completions process can limit the days we spend on the wellsite and, therefore, negatively impact the total revenue opportunity for certain of our services utilizing day-rate pricing models.

 This multi-well pad development, combined with upstream acreage consolidation and corporate mergers as well as the growing trends around the recycling and reuse applications of produced water provides a significant opportunity for companies like us that can deliver increasingly complex solutions for our E P customers across large swathes of acreage through our regional infrastructure networks, delivering solutions for the full completion and production lifecycle of wells. While these trends have advanced the most in the Permian Basin to date, they are emerging in other basins as well and Select has recently performed recycling projects in the Haynesville, Rockies and South Texas regions as well. The increased reuse of produced water requires additional chemical treatment solutions. We have a dedicated team of specialists focused every day on developing and deploying innovative water treatment and reuse services for our customers. O ur FluidMatch design solutions enable our customers to economically use these alternative sources to optimize their fluid systems by providing water profiling and fluid assessment services working towards real-time. This trend also supports more complex on-the-fly solutions that treat, proportion, and blend various streams of water and chemicals at the wellsite. This complexity favors service companies that are able to provide advanced technology solutions. Ultimately, we intend to play an important role in the advancement of water and chemical solutions that are designed to meet the sustainability goals of key stakeholders. Our water logistics, treatment, and chemical application expertise, in combination with advanced technology solutions, are applicable to other industries beyond oil and gas. We are working to further commercialize our services in other businesses and industries through our industrial solutions group. Our Segments Our services are offered through three reportable segments: (i) Water Services; (ii) Water Infrastructure; and (iii) Chemical Technologies. Water Services. The Water Services segment consists of the Company s services businesses, including water sourcing, water transfer, flowback and well testing, fluids hauling, water monitoring, water containment and water network automation, primarily serving E P companies. Additionally, this segment includes the operations of our accommodations and rentals business. Water Infrastructure. The Water Infrastructure segment consists of the Company s fixed infrastructure assets, including operations associated with our water distribution pipeline infrastructure, our water recycling solutions, and our produced water gathering systems and SWDs, as well as solids management facilities, primarily serving E P companies. Chemical Technologies. The Chemical Technologies segment provides technical solutions, products and expertise related to chemical applications in the oil and gas industry. We develop, manufacture, manage logistics and provide a full suite of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, stimulation, cementing and well completions for customers ranging from pressure pumpers to major integrated and independent oil and gas producers. This segment also utilizes its chemical experience and lab testing capabilities to customize tailored water treatment solutions designed to optimize the fracturing fluid system in conjunction with the quality of water used in well completions. 
 How We Generate Revenue We currently generate most of our revenue through our water-management services associated with well completions as well as ongoing produced water management, provided through our Water Services and Water Infrastructure segments. Most of this revenue is realized through customer agreements with fixed pricing terms and is recognized when delivery of services is provided, generally at our customers sites. While we have some long-term pricing arrangements, particularly in our Water Infrastructure segment, most of our water and water-related services are priced based on prevailing market conditions, giving due consideration to the customer s specific requirements. 

 45 

Table of Contents 
 We also generate revenue by providing completion and specialty chemicals through our Chemical Technologies segment. We invoice the majority of our Chemical Technologies customers for services provided based on the quantity of chemicals used or pursuant to short-term contracts as customer needs arise. Costs of Conducting Our Business The principal expenses involved in conducting our business are labor costs, vehicle and equipment costs (including depreciation, rental, repair and maintenance and leasing costs), raw materials and water sourcing costs and fuel costs. Our fixed costs are relatively low. Most of the costs of serving our customers are variable, i.e., they are incurred only when we provide water and water-related services, or chemicals and chemical-related services to our customers. Labor costs associated with our employees and contract labor comprise the largest portion of our costs of doing business. We incurred labor and labor-related costs of 134.2 million, 140.6 million, 399.2 million and 419.0 million for the Current Quarter, Prior Quarter, Current Period and Prior Period, respectively. The majority of our recurring labor costs are variable and dependent on the market environment and are incurred only while we are providing our operational services. We also incur costs to employ personnel to ensure safe operations, sell and supervise our services and perform maintenance on our assets, which is not as directly tied to our level of business activity. Additionally, we incur selling, general and administrative costs for compensation of our administrative personnel at our field sites and in our operational and corporate headquarters, as well as for third-party support, licensing and services. We incur significant vehicle and equipment costs in connection with the services we provide, including depreciation, repairs and maintenance, rental and leasing costs. We incurred vehicle and equipment costs of 80.0 million, 79.8 million, 238.5 million and 235.9 million for the Current Quarter, Prior Quarter, Current Period and Prior Period, respectively. We incur raw material costs in manufacturing our chemical products, as well as for water that we source for our customers. We incurred raw material costs of 54.8 million, 80.7 million, 179.7 million and 236.6 million for the Current Quarter, Prior Quarter, Current Period and Prior Period, respectively. We incur variable transportation costs associated with our service lines, predominately fuel and freight. We incurred fuel and freight costs of 19.7 million, 27.8 million, 64.7 million and 88.7 million for the Current Quarter, Prior Quarter, Current Period and Prior Period, respectively. Rising fuel prices impact our transportation costs, which affects the results of our operations. How We Evaluate Our Operations We use a variety of operational and financial metrics to assess our performance. Among other measures, management considers each of the following: Revenue; Gross Profit; Gross Margins; EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA; Cash Flows; and Free Cash Flow. 

46 

Table of Contents 
 Revenue We analyze our revenue and assess our performance by comparing actual monthly revenue to our internal projections and across periods. We also assess incremental changes in revenue compared to incremental changes in direct operating costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses across our reportable segments to identify potential areas for improvement, as well as to determine whether segment performance is meeting management s expectations. Gross Profit To measure our financial performance, we analyze our gross profit, which we define as revenues less direct operating expenses (including depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses). We believe gross profit provides insight into profitability and the true operating performance of our assets. We also compare gross profit to prior periods and across segments to identify trends as well as underperforming segments. Gross Margins Gross margins provide an important gauge of how effective we are at converting revenue into profits. This metric works in tandem with gross profit to ensure that we do not seek to increase gross profit at the expense of lower margins, nor pursue higher gross margins at the expense of declining gross profits. We track gross margins by segment and service line and compare them across prior periods and across segments and service lines to identify trends as well as underperforming segments. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA We view EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as important indicators of performance. We define EBITDA as net income/(loss), plus interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation, amortization and accretion. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus/(minus) loss/(income) from discontinued operations, plus any impairment and abandonment charges or asset write-offs pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP ), plus non-cash losses on the sale of assets or subsidiaries, non-recurring compensation expense, non-cash compensation expense, and non-recurring or unusual expenses or charges, including severance expenses, transaction costs, or facilities-related exit and disposal-related expenditures, plus/(minus) foreign currency losses/(gains), plus/(minus) losses/(gains) on unconsolidated entities and plus tax receivable agreements expense less bargain purchase gains from business combinations. The adjustments to EBITDA are generally consistent with such adjustments described in our Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility. See Comparison of Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for more information and a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Cash Flows and Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, plus proceeds received from sale of property and equipment. Our board of directors and executive management team use free cash flow to assess our liquidity and ability to repay maturing debt, fund operations and make additional investments. We believe free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an important indicator of our liquidity, including our ability to reduce net debt, make strategic investments, pay dividends and distributions and repurchase common stock. Our measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Furthermore, free cash flow is not a substitute for, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities nor any other measure prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow. Accordingly, free cash flow should not be considered a measure of the income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to it to invest in the growth of our business.

 Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations to Our Historical Results of Operations Our future results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of operations for the periods presented, primarily for the reasons described below and those described in Recent Developments above. Acquisition Activity As described above, we continuously evaluate potential investments, particularly in water infrastructure and other water-related services and technology. To the extent we consummate acquisitions, any incremental revenues or expenses from such transactions are not included in our historical results of operations. During the Current Period, we completed six business combinations and six asset acquisitions. Our historical financial statements for periods prior to the respective date each acquisition was completed do not include the results of operations of that acquisition. See Recent Developments and Note 3 Acquisitions for a description of these transactions.

This decrease was composed of a 17.9 million decrease in Water Services revenue and a 23.7 million decrease in Chemical Technologies revenue partially offset by a 23.6 million increase in Water Infrastructure revenue. The net 17.9 million decrease was driven primarily by macroeconomic factors stemming from lower frac crew deployments and associated price reductions impacted by competitor price cuts. For the Current Quarter, our Water Services, Water Infrastructure and Chemical Technologies constituted 63.0 , 22.1 and 14.9 of our total revenue, respectively, compared to 64.7 , 15.0 and 20.3 , respectively, for the Prior Quarter. The revenue changes by reportable segment are as follows:

Table of Contents 
 Water Services . Revenue decreased 17.9 million, or 7.1 , to 234.0 million for the Current Quarter compared to 251.9 million for the Prior Quarter. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to lower customer activity levels primarily driven by macroeconomic factors stemming from lower frac crew deployments and associated price reductions impacted by competitor price cuts. Water Infrastructure. Revenue increased 23.6 million, or 40.5 , to 82.0 million for the Current Quarter compared to 58.4 million for the Prior Quarter. The increase was primarily driven by additional revenue from acquisitions completed during the Current Period and growth in our recycling business line, offsetting lower pipeline distribution volumes. Chemical Technologies . Revenue decreased by 23.7 million, or 30.0 , to 55.3 million for the Current Quarter compared to 79.0 million for the Prior Quarter. The decrease in revenues was primarily driven by macroeconomic factors stemming from lower frac crew deployments and associated price reductions impacted by competitor price cuts. Costs of Revenue Costs of revenue decreased 24.1 million, or 7.2 , to 308.9 million for the Current Quarter compared to 333.0 million for the Prior Quarter. The decrease was primarily composed of a 14.3 million decrease in Water Services costs and a 14.6 million decrease in Chemical Technologies costs primarily due to supporting the lower revenue-producing activity discussed above. Water Infrastructure costs increased slightly by 0.5 million and depreciation, amortization and accretion increased by 4.3 million. Water Services . Costs of revenue decreased 14.3 million, or 7.1 , to 186.0 million for the Current Quarter compared to 200.4 million for the Prior Quarter. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue remained relatively steady at 79.5 as improved gross margins in our Water Transfer and Well Testing business lines, supported by effective cost controls and higher water sourcing margins, were partially offset by lower margins in fluids hauling due to price reductions, as well as reduced poly and containment margins, both of which were impacted by declining revenue stemming from broader macro-economic conditions. Water Infrastructure . Costs of revenue increased 0.5 million, or 1.5 , to 35.5 million for the Current Quarter compared to 35.0 million for the Prior Quarter. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased from 59.9 to 43.3 due primarily to an increase in disposal margin impacted by the margin accretive contributions of acquired disposal operations, improved operational throughput and execution, as well as higher skim oil sales. Additionally, growth in high-margin recycling revenue favorably impacted gross margin, which was partially offset by a decline in high-margin pipeline revenue. Chemical Technologies . Costs of revenue decreased 14.6 million, or 23.1 , to 48.5 million for the Current Quarter compared to 63.0 million for the Prior Quarter. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased from 79.7 to 87.6 primarily driven by higher absorption costs in our manufacturing facilities due to lower volumes as well as modest price reductions stemming from macroeconomic factors. Depreciation, amortization and accretion . Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense increased 4.3 million, or 12.3 , to 38.9 million for the Current Quarter compared to 34.7 million for the Prior Quarter primarily due to a higher fixed asset base resulting from recent acquisitions as well as investments made into fixed infrastructure projects. Gross Profit Gross profit was 62.4 million for the Current Quarter compared to 56.3 million for the Prior Quarter primarily driven by a 23.1 million increase in gross profit from our Water Infrastructure segment, partially offset by a 3.5 million decline in our Water Services segment, a 9.2 million decline in our Chemical Technologies segment and a 4.3 million increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 16.8 and 14.5 in the Current Quarter and Prior Quarter, respectively.

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.7 million, or 4.4 , to 37.3 million for the Current Quarter compared to 39.0 million for the Prior Quarter. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease of 4.1 million in transaction and rebranding costs, a 1.6 million decrease in bad debt expense and a 1.2 million decrease from a combination of other expenses partially offset by a 2.1 million increase in incentive and equity-based compensation cost, 1.2 million in higher research and development costs, 1.0 million in higher wages, associated payroll taxes and employer 401(k) match contributions and 0.9 million in higher legal and professional fees. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased by 1.1 million, or 149.2 , to 1.9 million for the Current Quarter compared to 0.8 million in the Prior Quarter due primarily to higher average borrowing on our Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility partially offset by interest income on cash balances. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased by 5.4 million, or 1,111.6 , to 5.9 million for the Current Quarter compared to 0.5 million in the Prior Quarter due to a release of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets at the end of 2023. Net Income Net income increased by 3.5 million, or 22.8 , to 18.8 million for the Current Quarter compared to 15.3 million for the Prior Quarter, driven primarily by higher gross profit, lower selling, general and administrative expenses and gains on sale of assets partially offset by higher income tax expense.

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11.1 million, or 10.2 , to 120.2 million for the Current Period compared to 109.1 million for the Prior Period. The increase was due primarily to a 7.9 million increase in incentive and equity-based compensation cost, 3.9 million in higher wages, associated payroll taxes and employer 401(k) match contributions, 2.3 million in higher legal and professional fees, 0.8 million in higher research and development costs, 0.7 million in higher contract labor and 0.6 million in severance expense partially offset by a 3.1 million decrease in bad debt expense, 1.0 million in lower transaction and rebranding costs, 0.7 million in lower vehicle lease costs and 0.3 million from a combination of other expenses. Impairments and Abandonments Prior Period impairment and abandonments were comprised of an 11.1 million trademark abandonment in the Chemical Technologies segment. Also, 0.4 million of abandonment was attributable to damaged property and equipment and 0.1 million to impair the remaining value of a cost-method investment in our Water Services segment. Current Period impairments and abandonments were less than 0.1 million. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased by 0.9 million, or 21.3 , to 5.2 million for the Current Period compared to 4.3 million in the Prior Period due primarily to higher average borrowing on our Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility partially offset by interest income on cash balances. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased by 10.2 million, or 954.6 , to 11.3 million for the Current Period compared to 1.1 million in the Prior Period due to a release of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets at the end of 2023. Net Income Net income decreased by 14.0 million, or 27.1 , to 37.6 million for the Current Period compared to 51.6 million for the Prior Period, driven primarily by higher selling, general and administrative expenses, including additional rebranding and transaction costs and higher income tax expense, partially offset by the trademark abandonment in the Prior Period. Comparison of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We view EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as important indicators of performance. We define EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation, amortization and accretion. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus/(minus) loss/(income) from discontinued operations, plus any impairment and abandonment charges or asset write-offs pursuant to GAAP, plus non-cash losses on the sale of assets or subsidiaries, non-recurring compensation expense, non-cash compensation expense, and non-recurring or unusual expenses or charges, including severance expenses, transaction costs, or facilities-related exit and disposal-related expenditures, plus/(minus) foreign currency losses/(gains), plus/(minus) losses/(gains) on unconsolidated entities and plus tax receivable agreements expense less bargain purchase gains from business combinations. The adjustments to EBITDA are generally consistent with such adjustments described in our Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility. See Comparison of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for more information and a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our board of directors, management and investors use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation, 

 54 

Table of Contents 
 amortization and accretion) and items outside the control of our management team. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they provide useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP. Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial performance and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool due to the exclusion of some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. One should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. The following table sets forth our reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to our net income, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the periods presented:

 (1) For the Current Period, these costs related to severance costs associated with our former CFO. (2) For all periods presented, the losses were due primarily to sales of real estate and underutilized or obsolete property and equipment. (3) For all periods presented, these costs were due primarily to legal-related due diligence costs and rebranding costs as well as costs related to certain acquired subsidiaries. 
 EBITDA was 66.1 million for the Current Quarter compared to 51.7 million for the Prior Quarter. The 14.4 million increase in EBITDA was driven primarily by a 10.4 million increase in gross profit, a 1.7 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expense and a 1.6 million increase in gains on asset sales. Adjusted EBITDA was 72.8 million for the Current Quarter compared to 63.0 million for the Prior Quarter.

 EBITDA was 170.0 million for the Current Period compared to 161.6 million for the Prior Period. The 8.4 million increase in EBITDA was driven primarily by a 8.6 million increase in gross profit and an 11.5 million decrease in impairments and abandonments partially offset by a 11.1 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense. Adjusted EBITDA was 202.2 million for the Current Period compared to 200.0 million for the Prior Period. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, borrowing capacity under the Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility, cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sale of excess property and equipment. Our primary uses of capital have been to fund current operations, maintain our asset base, implement technological advancements, make capital expenditures to support organic growth, fund acquisitions and minority investments, pay dividends and distributions, and when appropriate, repurchase shares of Class A common stock in the open market. Depending on available opportunities, market conditions and other factors, we may also issue debt and equity securities in the future, if needed. We prioritize sustained positive free cash flow and a strong balance sheet and evaluate potential acquisitions and investments in the context of those priorities, in addition to the economics of the opportunity. We believe this approach provides us with additional flexibility to evaluate larger investments as well as improved resilience in a sustained downturn versus many of our peers. Based on our current cash and cash equivalents balance, operating cash flow, available borrowings under our Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility and the ongoing actions discussed above, we believe that we will be able to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy our obligations and remain in compliance with our existing debt covenants through the next twelve months and beyond, prior to giving effect to any future financing that may occur. We intend to finance most of our capital expenditures, contractual obligations and working capital needs with cash on hand, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility. For a discussion of the Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility, see Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility below. Although we cannot provide any assurance, we believe that our current cash balance, operating cash flow and available borrowings under our Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated a quarterly dividend and distribution program of 0.05 per share and 0.05 per unit for holders of Class A and Class B shares, respectively. We paid quarterly dividends at the same rate through the third quarter of 2023, then the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend paid on November 17, 2023 to 0.06 per share and 0.06 per unit for holders of Class A and Class B shares, respectively. This resulted in a financing outflow of 21.5 million in the Current Period, and this quarterly dividend program is expected to continue. All future dividend payments are subject to quarterly review and approval by our board of directors. As of September 30, 2024 cash and cash equivalents totaled 10.9 million, and we had approximately 127.8 million of available borrowing capacity under our Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the borrowing base under the Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility was 226.8 million, we had 80.0 million in outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit totaling 19.0 million. As of November 4, 2024, we had 85.0 million in outstanding borrowings, the borrowing base under the Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility was 229.1 million, the outstanding letters of credit totaled 19.0 million, and the available borrowing capacity under the Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility was 125.1 million.

 Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, plus proceeds received from sale of property and equipment. Our board of directors and executive management team use free cash flow to assess our liquidity and ability to repay maturing debt, fund operations and make additional investments. We believe free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an important indicator of our liquidity, including our ability to reduce net debt, make strategic investments, pay dividends and distributions and repurchase common stock. Our measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Furthermore, free cash flow is not a substitute for, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities nor any other measure prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow. Accordingly, free cash flow should not be considered a measure of the income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to it to invest in the growth of our business. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

Nine months ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Dollars Percentage (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 167,119 202,162 (35,043) (17.3) Net cash used in investing activities (264,243) (104,939) (159,304) (151.8) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 50,981 (79,498) 130,479 164.1 Subtotal (46,143) 17,725 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (2) (4) 2 NM Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (46,145) 17,721 Analysis of Cash Flow Changes between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Operating Activities . Net cash provided by operating activities was 167.1 million for the Current Period, compared to 202.2 million for the Prior Period. The 35.0 million decrease is comprised of a 31.9 million reduction in converting working capital to cash and a decrease of 3.1 million of net income combined with non-cash adjustments. Investing Activities . Net cash used in investing activities was 264.2 million for the Current Period, compared to 104.9 million for the Prior Period. The 159.3 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was due primarily to an increase of 145.0 million spent for acquisitions net of cash received and a 15.7 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a 0.9 million increase in proceeds received from sales of property and equipment. Financing Activities . Net cash provided by financing activities was 51.0 million for the Current Period, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 79.5 million for the Prior Period. The 130.5 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to borrowings net of debt repayments increasing 96.0 million and a 42.6 million decrease in repurchases of shares of Class A common stock partially offset by 4.4 million of cash received from noncontrolling interest holders net of payments in the Prior Period and a 3.6 million increase in dividends and distributions paid.

ASU 2023-07 requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items to reconcile to segment profit or loss, and the title and position of the entity s CODM. The amendments in this update also expand the interim segment disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-07 will be effective for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, and for interim periods starting in our first quarter of 2025. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments in this update are required to be applied on a retrospective basis. We are currently reviewing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-07 may have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which includes amendments that further enhance income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 will be effective for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2023-09 to determine its impact on the Company s disclosures. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we had no material off-balance-sheet arrangements. As such, we are not exposed to any material financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The demand, pricing and terms for oilfield services provided by us are largely dependent upon the level of drilling and completion activity in the U.S. oil and gas industry as well as the level of oil and gas production. The level of drilling and completion activity is influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including, but not limited to: the supply of and demand for oil and gas; war, armed conflicts, economic sanctions and other constraints to global trade and economic growth; current price levels as well as expectations about future prices of oil and gas, including announcements and actions taken by the members of OPEC+ with respect to oil production levels; the magnitude and timing of capital spending by our customers; the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and gas; the extent to which our E P customers choose to drill and complete new wells to offset decline from their existing wells; the extent to which our E P customers choose to invest to grow production; discoveries of new oil and gas reserves; available storage capacity and pipeline and other transportation capacity; weather conditions; domestic and worldwide economic conditions; instability in oil-producing countries; environmental regulations; technical advances in alternative forms of energy (e.g., wind and solar electricity, electric vehicles) that encourage substitution for or displacement of oil and gas consumption in end-use markets; the price and availability of alternative fuels; the ability of oil and gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing; global health events; merger and acquisition activity and consolidation in our industry, and other factors. Any combination of these factors that results in sustained low oil and gas prices and, therefore, lower capital spending and / or reduced drilling and completion activity by our customers, would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Interest Rate Risk As of September 30, 2024, we had 80.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility. As of November 4, 2024, we had 85.0 million in outstanding borrowings and 125.1 million of available borrowing capacity under our Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility. Interest is calculated under the terms of our Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility based on our selection, from time to time, of one of the index rates available to us plus an applicable margin that varies based on certain factors. We do not currently have or intend to enter into any derivative arrangements to protect against fluctuations in interest rates applicable to our outstanding indebtedness. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such

Table of Contents 
 information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely against us, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are, however, named defendants in certain lawsuits, investigations and claims arising in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including certain environmental claims and employee-related matters, and we expect that we will be named defendants in similar lawsuits, investigations and claims in the future. While the outcome of these lawsuits, investigations and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We have not assumed any liabilities arising out of these existing lawsuits, investigations and claims. Item 1A. Risk Factors There are a number of risks that we believe are applicable to our business and the industry in which we operate. These risks are described elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the SEC, including the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks and uncertainties described within our Annual Report on Form 10-K or this Quarterly Report actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
