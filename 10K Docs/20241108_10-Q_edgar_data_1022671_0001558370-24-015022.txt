 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements This report contains some predictive statements about future events, including statements related to conditions in domestic or global economies, conditions in steel, aluminum, and recycled metals market places, Steel Dynamics' revenues, costs of purchased materials, future profitability and earnings, and the operation of new, existing or planned facilities. These statements, which we generally precede or accompany by such typical conditional words as "anticipate", "intend", "believe", "estimate", "plan", "seek", "project", or "expect", or by the words "may", "will", or "should", are intended to be made as "forward-looking", subject to many risks and uncertainties, within the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements speak only as of this date and are based upon information and assumptions, which we consider reasonable as of this date, concerning our businesses and the environments in which they operate. Such predictive statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we undertake no duty to update or revise any such statements. Some factors that could cause such forward-looking statements to turn out differently than anticipated include: (1) domestic and global economic factors; (2) global steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel, together with increased scrap prices; (3) pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues; (4) the cyclical nature of the steel industry and the industries we serve; (5) volatility and major fluctuations in prices and availability of scrap metal, scrap substitutes and supplies, and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers; (6) cost and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil, and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions; (7) increased environmental, greenhouse gas emissions and sustainability considerations from our customers or related regulations; (8) compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements; (9) significant price and other forms of competition from other steel and aluminum producers, scrap processors and alternative materials; (10) availability of an adequate source of supply of scrap for our metals recycling operations; (11) cybersecurity threats and risks to the security of our sensitive data and information technology; (12) the implementation of our growth strategy; (13) litigation and legal compliance; (14) unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns; (15) governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits; (16) our senior unsecured credit facility contains, and any future financing agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility; and (17) the impacts of impairment charges. More specifically, we refer you to our more detailed explanation of these and other factors and risks that may cause such predictive statements to turn out differently, as set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K under the headings Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors for the year ended December 31, 2023, in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, or in other reports which we from time to time file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports are available publicly on the Securities and Exchange Commission website, www.sec.gov , and on our website, www.steeldynamics.com under Investors SEC Filings. Description of the Business We are one of the largest domestic steel producers and metal recyclers in the United States, based on estimated steelmaking and steel coating capacity of approximately 16 million tons and actual metals recycling volumes, with one of the most diversified product and end market portfolios in the domestic steel industry, combined with meaningful downstream steel fabrication operations. The company s primary sources of revenue are currently from the manufacture and sale of steel products, the processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals, and the fabrication and sale of steel joists and deck products. Operating Statement Classifications Net Sales . Net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped, product mix and related pricing. We charge premium prices for certain grades of steel, product dimensions, certain smaller volumes, and for value-added processing or coating of our steel products. Except for the steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns and claims from these sales at the point in time control of the product transfers to the customer, upon shipment or delivery. Our steel fabrication operations recognize revenues over time based on completed fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total tons required for each contract.

Table of Contents 
 Costs of Goods Sold . Our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products. The principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes (which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold), steel substrate, direct and indirect labor and related benefits, alloys, zinc, transportation and freight, repairs and maintenance, utilities such as electricity and natural gas, and depreciation. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales, finance and accounting, and administrative departments, including, among other items, labor and related benefits, and professional services. Companywide profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets are each separately presented in the statement of income. Interest Expense, net of Capitalized Interest . Interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt, net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects. Other (Income) Expense, net . Other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits, short-term and other investments, and any other non-operating income activity, including income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method. Other expense consists of any non-operating costs, such as certain acquisition and financing expenses. Results Overview In the third quarter of 2024 we achieved quarterly steel shipments of 3.2 million tons, as steel demand was solid. Our metals recycling operations benefitted from consistent domestic steel industry demand during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, while our steel fabrication segment achieved strong results on seasonally solid non-residential construction demand. Consolidated operating income decreased 338.1 million, or 46 , to 395.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023 as metal spread contracted across all operating platforms. Third quarter 2024 net income attributable to Steel Dynamics, Inc. decreased 259.4 million, or 45 , to 317.8 million, compared to the third quarter of 2023, consistent with decreased operating income. Consolidated operating income decreased 927.1 million, or 35 , to 1.7 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023. First nine months 2024 net income attributable to Steel Dynamics, Inc. decreased 696.8 million, or 34 , to 1.3 billion, compared to the first nine months of 2023, consistent with decreased operating income.

 Steel Operations Segment Results 2024 vs. 2023 During the third quarter of 2024, our steel operations achieved shipments of 3.2 million tons (2.9 million excluding intra-segment). Despite stable steel demand during the quarter, we experienced lower realized average selling prices, primarily for flat rolled products as generally 80 percent of this business is contractually based and tied to lagging pricing indices. Third quarter 2024 total steel segment average selling prices decreased 11 , or 130 per ton, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Steel operations segment shipments increased 3 in the third quarter 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. Net sales for the steel operations in the third quarter 2024 decreased 8 compared to the same period in 2023, due to the decrease in average steel selling prices. Net sales for the steel operations decreased 3 in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost, generally comprising approximately 55 to 65 of our steel mill operations manufacturing costs. Our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations decreased 38 per ton, or 9 , in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, consistent with overall decreased domestic ferrous scrap pricing noted below in the Metals Recycling Operations segment discussion. In the first nine months of 2024, our metallic raw material cost per ton decreased 30, or 7 , compared to the same period in 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, as a result of average selling prices decreasing more than scrap costs, metal spread (which we define as the difference between average steel mill selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed in our steel mills) decreased 12 compared to the third quarter of 2023. As a result of this metal spread compression, operating income for the steel operations decreased 37 , to 301.3 million, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. First nine months 2024 operating income decreased 7 , to 1.4 billion, compared to the first nine months of 2023 due primarily to a 1 decrease in metal spread, as scrap costs decreased more than selling prices.

 Metals Recycling Operations Segment Metals recycling operations include our OmniSource ferrous and nonferrous processing, transportation, marketing, brokerage, and scrap management services primarily throughout the United States and in Central and Northern Mexico. Our steel mills utilize a large portion of the ferrous scrap sold by our metals recycling operations as raw material in our steelmaking operations, and the remainder is sold to other consumers, such as other steel manufacturers and foundries. In the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, 61 and 62 , respectively, of metals recycling operations ferrous scrap was sold to our own steel mills, while our steel mill utilization was 80 in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. Metals recycling operations accounted for 13 and 11 of our consolidated net sales during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 13 and 12 during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Metals Recycling Operations Segment Shipments:

Ferrous scrap average selling prices decreased 5 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, while nonferrous scrap prices increased 10 , resulting in a 4 increase in segment net sales. Ferrous metal spreads (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap) increased 8 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, and nonferrous metal spreads decreased 22 . As a result of the decreased nonferrous metals spreads, metals recycling operations operating income decreased 45 to 7.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Net sales for our metals recycling operations in the first nine months of 2024 decreased 1 compared to the same period in 2023. Ferrous scrap average selling prices declined 6 during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, while nonferrous average selling prices increased 3 . Ferrous shipments were flat and nonferrous shipments increased 5 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. Ferrous metal spreads were flat, while nonferrous metal spreads decreased 16 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. Metals recycling operations operating income in the first nine months of 2024 of 54.7 million decreased 37 from the first nine months of 2023 due to the decreased nonferrous metal spreads.

Steel Fabrication Operations Segment Steel fabrication operations include the company s New Millennium Building Systems joist and deck plants located throughout the United States, and in Northern Mexico. Revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses, girders, steel joists and steel deck used within the non-residential construction industry. Steel fabrication operations accounted for 10 and 14 of our consolidated net sales during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 10 and 15 during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Steel Fabrication Operations Segment Results 2024 vs. 2023 Net sales for the steel fabrication operations decreased 29 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, as average selling prices decreased 1,080 per ton, or 28 , and volume decreased 2 from the third quarter of 2023. While demand remained at historically strong levels, third quarter 2024 was impacted by lower shipments and continued falling selling prices, as we continue to move back to pre-pandemic pricing levels. Our steel fabrication operations continue to benefit from the solid non-residential construction market, as evidenced by an historically solid order backlog that extends through the first quarter 2025. The continued onshoring of manufacturing, coupled with interest rate declines and the U.S. infrastructure program, supports consistent strong demand. The purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations, historically representing approximately two-thirds of the total cost of manufacturing. The average cost per ton of steel consumed decreased 9 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. As a result of decreased selling prices per ton, metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel) contracted 36 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This metal spread compression coupled with decreased volume resulted in operating income decreasing 50 to 165.6 million in the third quarter 2024, compared to 330.0 million in the same period in 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, operating income decreased 61 to 524.7 million compared to the first nine months of 2023, due to a 44 decrease in metal spread.

Aluminum Operations Segment Aluminum operations include the recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill being constructed in Columbus, Mississippi, and two satellite recycled aluminum slab centers in the southwest United States (US) and central Mexico. The flat rolled products mill is a joint venture concurrently formed with Unity Aluminum, Inc. of which SDI has a 94.4 equity interest. Construction is progressing on the flat rolled products mill and the recycled aluminum slab centers with the flat rolled mill operations expected to begin mid-2025 and operations at the Mexico and US recycled slab centers in 2025. The results of this segment currently consist of construction and start-up costs recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, included within the discussion of consolidated results within the Other Consolidated Results section below. During the first nine months of 2024, there were no additional results of operations, such as those related to shipments or production, to be discussed. 

 Other Consolidated Results Third Quarter Consolidated Results 2024 vs. 2023 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses of 167.7 million during the third quarter of 2024 increased 15 from 145.9 million during the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense related to the growth of the aluminum operations segment during 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses represented 3.9 and 3.2 of net sales during third quarter 2024 and 2023, respectively. Profit sharing expense during the third quarter of 2024 of 34.4 million decreased 47 from the 64.4 million during the same period in 2023, consistent with decreased pretax earnings. This decrease in profit sharing expense was the primary driver of decreased operating loss for other operations of 33 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Profit sharing expense for eligible employees is 8 of consolidated pretax income excluding noncontrolling interests and other items. Interest Expense, net of Capitalized Interest. During the third quarter of 2024, interest expense of 17.1 million, was comparable to the 18.4 million during the third quarter of 2023. Other (Income) Expense, net. Net other income was 29.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 39.5 million in the third quarter of 2023, due primarily to the impact of decreased interest income and increased foreign currency exchange rate losses in the third quarter 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Income Tax Expense. Third quarter 2024 income tax expense of 87.1 million, at an effective income tax rate of 21.4 , decreased 50 compared to the 174.8 million, at an effective income tax rate of 23.2 , during the third quarter of 2023, consistent with decreased pretax earnings. Our effective tax rate decrease was due primarily to certain discrete tax adjustments during the third quarter of 2024. First Nine Months Consolidated Results 2024 vs. 2023 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses of 487.2 million during the first nine months of 2024 increased 13 from 431.4 million during the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense related to the growth of the aluminum operations segment during 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses represented 3.6 and 3.0 of net sales during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Profit sharing expense during the first nine months of 2024 of 145.1 million decreased 35 from the 225.0 million during the same period in 2023, consistent with decreased pretax earnings. This decrease in profit sharing expense was the primary driver of decreased operating loss for other operations of 25 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

 Interest Expense, net of Capitalized Interest. During the first nine months of 2024, interest expense of 41.8 million decreased 32 from 61.7 million during the first nine months of 2023. The lower interest expense in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is due to higher capitalized interest in 2024 related to construction at our Sinton and Heartland divisions, and within the aluminum operations segment. Other (Income) Expense, net. Net other income was 75.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 105.7 million in the first nine months of 2023, due primarily to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate losses of 14.5 million in 2024 compared to gains of 7.5 million in 2023. Income Tax Expense. First nine months 2024 income tax expense of 398.8 million, at an effective income tax rate of 22.9 , decreased 37 compared to the 636.4 million, at an effective income tax rate of 23.8 , during the first nine months of 2023, consistent with decreased pretax earnings. Our effective tax rate decrease was due primarily to certain discrete tax adjustments during the third quarter of 2024. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources and Long-term Debt. Our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for, among other things, the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our operations, and to remain in compliance with environmental laws. Our short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, including expansion projects, principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, dividends to our shareholders, and potential stock repurchases and acquisitions or investments. We have met and intend to continue to meet these liquidity requirements primarily with available cash and cash provided by operations, long-term borrowings, and we also have availability under our unsecured Revolver. Our liquidity at September 30, 2024, is as follows (in thousands): 

Cash and equivalents 1,015,210 Short-term and other investments 883,546 Revolver availability 1,190,709 Total liquidity 3,089,465 Our total outstanding debt of 3.7 billion increased 612.8 million compared to December 31, 2023, due to our issuance of senior unsecured notes in July 2024 as described in Note 3, the proceeds of which may be used for the repayment at or prior to maturity of our 2.800 senior notes due December 2024, working capital, capital expenditures, advances for or investments in the company s subsidiaries, acquisitions, redemption and repayment of other outstanding indebtedness, and purchases of the company s common stock. Our total long-term debt to capitalization ratio (representing our long-term debt, including current maturities, divided by the sum of our long-term debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and our total stockholders equity) was 28.9 and 25.8 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our unsecured credit agreement has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Facility) , which provides a 1.2 billion Revolver and matures in July 2028. Subject to certain conditions, we have the ability to increase the Facility size by 500.0 million. The unsecured Revolver is available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. The Facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability to incur indebtedness and permit liens on certain assets. Our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the unsecured Revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants. At September 30, 2024, we had 1.2 billion of availability on the Revolver, 9.3 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability, and there were no borrowings outstanding. The financial covenants under our Facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50:1.00. Our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last-twelve-months (LTM) consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Facility (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other non-cash transactions as defined in the Facility) by our LTM gross interest expense, less amortization of financing fees. In addition, a debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 0.60:1.00 must be maintained. At September 30, 2024, our 

 22 

Table of Contents 
 interest coverage ratio and debt to capitalization ratio were 25.88:1.00 and 0.29:1.00, respectively. We were, therefore, in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2024, and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months. Working Capital (representing excess of current assets over current liabilities). We generated cash flow from operations of 1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2.7 billion in the same 2023 period. Working capital decreased 704.2 million, or 16 , during the first nine months of 2024 to 3.8 billion at September 30, 2024, due to a 385.7 million decrease in cash and equivalents, and a 422.0 million increase in current maturities of long-term debt, as our 400 million 2.400 senior notes due 2025 were recorded as current in June 2024. Capital Investments. During the first nine months of 2024, we invested 1.4 billion in property, plant and equipment, primarily within our aluminum operations segment and steel operations segment, compared with 1.1 billion invested during the same period in 2023. We are currently executing our plan to invest 2.7 billion in a new state-of-the-art low-carbon recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill with two supporting satellite recycled aluminum slab centers, which are being funded by available cash and cash flow from operations. Related expenditures began in the third quarter of 2022 and are expected to continue through early 2025. Our liquidity of 3.1 billion and anticipated future operating cash flow generation is sufficient to provide for our planned 2024 capital requirements. Cash Dividends. As a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation capability and financial position, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 8 to 0.46 per share in the first quarter of 2024 (from 0.425 per share for each quarter in 2023), resulting in declared cash dividends of 214.6 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 212.5 million during the same period in 2023. We paid cash dividends of 212.2 million and 201.8 million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our board of directors, along with executive management, approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. The determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, outstanding indebtedness, current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans. Other. Our board of directors has authorized share repurchase programs during prior years, the most recent of which occurred in November 2023 for a program of up to 1.5 billion of the company s common stock. Under the share repurchase programs, purchases take place as and when we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects, our cash flows from operations, and general economic conditions. The share repurchase programs do not require us to acquire any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended, extended, or terminated by us at any time. The share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date. There were 917.0 million and 1.1 billion of share repurchases during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had 486.4 million remaining available to purchase under the November 2023 share repurchase program. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will depend upon general economic, financial, and business conditions, along with competition, legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure that our operating results, cash flows, access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. We believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flows from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including borrowings under our Facility, if necessary, will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, funding working capital requirements, and funding anticipated capital expenditures.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Commodity Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations, such as metallic raw materials, electricity, water, natural gas and its transportation services, fuel, air products, zinc, and electrodes. Our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. Our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity, water, natural gas and its transportation services, fuel, air products, zinc, and electrodes. Certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of generally up to 5 years for physical commodity requirements and commodity transportation requirements, with some extending beyond, and for up to 16 years for air products and 28 years for water products. We utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts. We believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process. In our metals recycling and steel operations, we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous and ferrous metals. Our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin, within certain parameters, that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor. As of September 30, 2024, substantially all of these financial contracts have a settlement date within the next twelve months. We believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts will be fully consummated. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
