and long-term line of credit inventory, related party of at December 31, 2023 were
reclassified to current in the current consolidated balance sheet for comparability purposes. 

We
generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs
are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. Customers deposits, deferred revenue and other receipts
are deferred and recognized when the revenue is realized and earned. Cash payments to customers are classified as reductions of
revenue in our statements of operations. 

Balance, December 31, 2023 

Balance, September 30, 2024 

Contract
assets consist of trade accounts receivable. 

Revenue
recognized in the reporting period that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period was 
and , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Other
revenue may include revenue from technology license fees and paid development projects. Technology license fees and paid development
projects are recognized over time when the obligations under the agreed upon contractual arrangements are performed on our part. 
Other revenue recognized over time was and , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and
 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

and in potential common stock, respectively. Options to purchase approximately and shares
of common stock that were outstanding as of September 30, 2023 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The inclusion of these shares for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023 would have resulted in an anti-dilutive effect and were thus omitted from disclosure. 

Denominator: 

Weighted average number of basic shares outstanding 

Weighted average additional shares assuming conversion of in-the-money stock options to common shares 

Weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding

Our
financial instruments include cash, any cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, along with
any short-term and long-term borrowings as described in Note 6. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
and accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates of their fair value due to the short-term nature of these accounts.
The fair value of short-term and long-term debt approximates carrying value based on comparison of terms to similar debt offering
in the marketplace. 

There
were no financial instruments adjusted to fair value on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Illinois facility lease agreement. No borrowings have been incurred under this promissory
 note. It is our intention to renew this note annually. Because there were no amounts
 outstanding on the note at any time during 2024 or 2023, we have recorded no related
 liability on our balance sheet. 

2) plus .
 This credit agreement has a maturity of . We expect to renew this agreement

 Loan Agreement extending the maturity of the Term Maturity Note to . 

6) . The interest rate for the Bridge Note was at the plus , and
 it was to mature on . The Bridge Note was repaid in February 2024. 

The
Company classifies the line of credit accounts receivable as current because we are required to pay back the borrowings
as cash is received from our customers. The company s remaining debt is presented within the consolidated balance sheet
as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, in accordance with the maturity dates in the financing agreements. 

Beachcorp,
LLC and Strandler, LLC are affiliates of Mr. Bradford T. Whitmore, who beneficially owns a majority of the Company s common
stock and is the brother of Ms. R. Janet Whitmore, a director of the Company and the chair of the Company s board of directors.
The A/R Revolver Facility, the Inventory Facility and the New Term Loan are all secured by all the unencumbered assets of the
Company and subordinated to the Company s credit facility with Libertyville Bank Trust. The Company s loan agreements
with Strandler, LLC and Beachcorp, LLC currently are set to expire on October 1, 2025, which could become an operating risk if
we are not able to refinance or extend the maturity dates. Related party interest summary:

The total monthly payments for 2025 will be , escalating to and for the year 2026 and 2027, respectively, with one

Nanophase
Technologies subleases portions of its leased facilities that are used to support operations for the lessees. Total lease payment
received for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was and , respectively. Total lease payment received
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was and , respectively. The arrangement is not with a related
party. 

Payments
received by the Company for these subleases are comprised of two components, which include base rent and Common Area Maintenance
(CAM) charges. While the base rent is fixed, the CAM charges are indexed directly to the Master Lease and are expected to be adjusted
periodically as actual costs are incurred. However, the executed sublease agreements specifically itemize these costs with a provision
that informs the sublessee that the CAM charges will be adjusted (up or down) based on actual amounts once this information becomes
known. As such, the nature of the charges is more closely representative of a fixed payment (an in-substance fixed 
charge) with the adjustments occurring simply to true up the listed CAM charges once actual charges from the head
lessor become known. As sublessor, Nanophase Technologies has elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and nonlease
components in disclosing future undiscounted cashflows and treats the combined components as a single lease component. 

Both
subleases are now month to month. There are no future undiscounted lease payments that are guaranteed.

The
Company had reserves for excess and obsolete inventory of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

shares of the Company s Series X Preferred Stock
(the Series X Preferred Stock at a purchase price per share of , for total consideration of ,
in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof. The
terms of the Series X Preferred Stock are set forth in the Company s Certificate of Designations to its Certificate of Incorporation,
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on March 4, 2024 (the Certificate of Designations ). 

Under
the Purchase Agreement, the Company granted Strandler customary registration rights with respect to shares of the Company s
common stock, par value per share (the Common Stock ), it may receive in connection with any conversion
of Series X Preferred Stock into Common Stock, as described below. For so long as any amount of Preferred Stock was outstanding,
the Purchase Agreement also (i) prevented the Company from paying any dividend on any shares of the Company s capital stock
(other than dividends consisting solely of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock), (ii) prevented the Company from repurchasing
any Common Stock, and (iii) subject to certain permitted exceptions, restricted the Company s ability to permit any lien
or other encumbrance on Company assets. 

At
any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, following the Company properly filing an amendment (the Certificate
Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of its Common Stock from to ,
each share of Series X Preferred Stock was convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of Common Stock at no additional
cost. If the Company had not properly filed, upon shareholder approval, the Certificate Amendment on or before August 1, 2024,
then each share of Series X Preferred Stock would have been redeemable at the holder s option, in whole or in part, without
penalty or premium, at a redemption price equal to per share (each, a Redemption ). If the Company
failed to fully pay any Redemption within five days of receiving notice, all unpaid amounts would bear interest at a rate of 
per annum. In addition, in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) of the Company, each
share of the Series X Preferred Stock would have been redeemable at the option of the holder, without penalty or premium, at a
redemption price equal to per share. Upon any conversion of Preferred Stock into Common Stock by Strandler, Strandler
is required to hold the Common Stock received in the conversion for a period of 12 months. 

Holders
of Series X Preferred Stock (i) are not entitled to receive dividends, subject to customary anti-dilution protections, (ii) have
no voting rights, and (iii) receive a liquidation preference of per share. The Series X Preferred Stock ranks senior
in right of payment to all securities designated as junior securities, including Common Stock. 

ASC
815-15-25-17D provides guidance for assessing host contracts in the form of preferred shares, in which 25-17D(b) states that an
investor s ability to convert a preferred share into a fixed number of common shares generally is viewed as an equity-like
characteristic . Because conversion of the Series X Preferred Shares is at the discretion of the Holder, conversion is in
a fixed number of shares, dividends are not typically paid and cash settlement would only occur in the unlikely event of change
in control, the host contract has the characteristics of, and is classified as, an equity instrument, and the embedded derivatives
and host contract are considered clearly and closely related. As such, the embedded derivative does not require bifurcation and
the Series X Preferred Shares shall be reported as mezzanine equity on the balance sheet. 

Issuance
costs associated with issuance of the Series X Preferred Stock were immaterial. 

On
June 18, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders where the Certificate Amendment was approved. The Certificate
Amendment was filed with the State of Delaware on June 19, 2024. On June 20, 2024, Strandler converted its shares
of Series X Preferred Stock to shares of Common Stock.

We
currently have exclusive supply agreements with BASF Corporation BASF ), that have contingencies outlined which
could potentially result in the sale of production equipment from the Company to the customer intended to provide capacity sufficient
to meet the customer s production needs. This outcome may occur if we fail to meet certain performance requirements. In
the event of an equipment sale, upon incurring a triggering event, the equipment would be sold to the customer at either 
of the equipment s net book value or the greater of of the original book value of such equipment, and any associated
upgrades to it, or of the equipment s net book value, depending on the equipment and related products. 

If
a triggering event were to occur and BASF elected to proceed with the equipment sale mentioned above, we would lose significant
revenue. Replacement of necessary equipment that could be purchased and removed by the customer pursuant to this triggering event
could take in excess of twelve months. Any additional capital outlays required to rebuild capacity would probably be greater than
the proceeds from the purchase of the assets as dictated by our agreement with the customer. Similar consequences would occur
if we were determined to have materially breached certain other provisions of the supply agreement with BASF. 

We
recently amended our Zinc Oxide Supply Agreement with BASF regarding using our commercially reasonable efforts to develop a modified
zinc oxide product for BASF s exclusive purchase. The amendment also includes provisions (a) amending the exclusivity section
of the Agreement to provide that (i) BASF has the exclusive right to use zinc oxide materials that we develop, make, or sell to
BASF as an ingredient for uses in the field of use designated in the Agreement, and (ii) we can supply and sell both certain finished
products containing zinc oxide for use in the field of use to customers anywhere in the world and certain zinc oxide dispersions
that we developed or develop for a particular customer, and (b) amending the provisions of the Agreement concerning order forecasting
and procedures, operational planning, inventory and capacity requirements, and periodic facility shutdown arrangements, to more
effectively serve each party s business needs with respect to all product that BASF purchases from us under the Agreement.

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview

Nanophase
is a health-oriented, science-driven company, which, along with its wholly owned subsidiary, Sol sence, LLC (our Sol sence
beauty science subsidiary ), is focused on various beauty- and life-science markets. Our primary skin health products are
fully developed prestige skin care formulations with mineral-based UV protection, marketed and sold through our Sol sence
beauty science subsidiary, enabled by our proprietary Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients APIs which are also marketed
as APIs for sale to manufacturers of other types of skin health products, including sunscreens and daily care products. 
In terms of the balance of our life sciences focus, we have seen current conditions decrease demand for our medical diagnostics
ingredients, which are used in testing for various viruses. Additionally, we continue to sell products in legacy markets
including architectural coatings, industrial coating applications, abrasion-resistant additives, plastics additives, and surface
finishing technologies (polishing) applications all of which, along with medical diagnostics, currently fall into the advanced
materials product category. 

12 

Leveraging
a platform of integrated patented and proprietary technologies, we create products with unique performance to enhance end-consumers 
health and well-being. We offer soup-to-nuts production, from engineered materials, formulation development, and finished product
development, to commercial manufacturing and packaging capabilities. Our expertise in materials engineering allows us to effectively
coat and disperse materials on a nano and non-nano scale for use in a variety of markets in skin health, including
for use in sunscreens as APIs and as fully developed prestige skin care products, marketed and sold through our Sol sence
beauty science subsidiary. We believe that we have developed technological advantages with respect to our APIs sold for use as
ingredients, while our Sol sence beauty science technologies lead to enhanced efficacy and aesthetics in our finished products,
which have received broad acceptance in the marketplace. Due to the enhanced efficacy and aesthetic qualities offered by our proprietary
technology platform, Sol sence finished products satisfy growing consumer demands around clean and inclusive
beauty. Sol sence beauty science also benefits from the Company s vertical integration with each product s
key active ingredient that delivers its point-of-difference. This vertical integration helps us to improve efficiency and avoid
potential major supply chain challenges while also addressing ongoing sustainability efforts.

Chain Reaction PCR testing for various viruses, most notably SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 ), has become an
important use of our technology in the life science space. However, we have seen current conditions decrease demand for our medical
diagnostics ingredients, which are used in testing for various viruses. We believe that our deep expertise in materials science
has created advantages that enable performance in certain tests that may not be achievable through other materials. Outside of
life science, we continue to sell advanced materials for use in legacy applications, all of which, along with medical diagnostics,
currently fall into the advanced materials product category. 

Given
our technological position, in addition to the historical market acceptance of our APIs for use in skin health products and sunscreens,
rapidly growing sales for our suite of Sol sence finished products, and the expanded use of our diagnostic materials
in aiding the fight to curb the spread of COVID-19 and other viruses, in 2021 we announced that we reoriented our Company strategy.
Regardless of the demand decrease for our medical diagnostic ingredients, we continue to see unprecedented demand in beauty science
for our APIs and finished products. The markets for both have shown an appetite for what we are producing, and management believes
that this growth is happening now due to a confluence of our technology, market conditions that favor what we produce, and our
expanded expertise in these areas. 

Nanophase,
primarily through Sol sence, now partners with brands to develop, manufacture, and market products and ingredients that
enhance lives through healthy skin. We are focusing our combined business-, ingredient-, and product-development capabilities
on products with unique performance in this area. While we will continue to produce and sell materials to our other advanced materials
customers, it is not our strategic focus. We may develop additional technologies or find unique applications outside of our core
markets in the future, but to maximize the use of our resources today, we plan on expanding efforts in areas where we have proven
we can deliver innovation and growth. 

Results
of Operations 

Total
revenue increased to 16,866 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7,958 for the same period in 2023. Total
revenue increased to 39,780 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 29,286 for the same period in 2023. Much
of our revenue was from our largest customers for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 2024, and 2023, respectively.
This reflects sales to our largest customers for our finished skin health products marketed through our Sol sence subsidiary
and sales of APIs to our largest customer in skin care and sunscreen applications. This
is the revenue breakdown, as a percentage of total revenue, from the customers referenced above during the three- and nine- months
periods ended September 2024, and 2023 respectively:

Product
revenue, the primary component of our total revenue, increased to 16,785 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 7,746 during the same period of 2023, and increased to 39,479 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 28,925
during the same period of 2023. The three-month and nine-month increase in product revenue were due to higher sales in our Sol sence 
and Personal Care Ingredients product categories offset by lower sales in our Advanced Materials product category. 

Other
revenue decreased to 81 and 301 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 212
and 361 for the same periods in 2023, respectively. Other revenue is typically comprised primarily of developmental or licensing
fees. 

Cost
of revenue generally includes costs associated with commercial production and customer development arrangements. Cost of
revenue increased to 10,764 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6,428 for the same period in 2023, and
increased to 26,358 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 21,932 for the same period in 2023. The
increase for the three months in the cost of revenue was primarily driven by increased volume, manufacturing operating inefficiencies,
and facilities improvements. The increase for the nine months in cost of revenue was primarily driven by increased volume, price
inflation on materials, manufacturing operating inefficiencies and facilities improvements. While we typically pass-through costs
to our customers, we sometimes cannot pass through 100 of pricing increases on raw materials, and even with pass throughs, our
gross margin percentage is negatively impacted by higher material costs. 

13 

Capacity
is a key area of focus to increase throughput first, followed quickly by increased cost efficiency once we can achieve greater
scale. Our planning has had us adding to our current fixed manufacturing cost structure through 2024 to accommodate additional
growth, and to build a better base for further growth beyond that level. The extent to which margins grow, as a percentage
of total revenue, will be dependent upon revenue mix, revenue volume, our ability to cut costs and pass commodity market-driven
raw materials increases on to customers, and the speed and efficiency with which we are able to scale up production for our Sol sence
products. We expect that, as product revenue volume increases, our fixed manufacturing costs will be more efficiently absorbed,
which should lead to increased margins as we grow. Our most critical operational issue today is reducing controllable variable
product manufacturing costs. 

Research
and development expense, which includes all expenses relating to the technology and advanced engineering groups, primarily consists
of costs associated with the development or acquisition of new finished product formulations for skin care, new product applications
for our skin care ingredients, advancement of our medical diagnostics ingredient knowledge, and the cost of enhancing our manufacturing
processes. As an example, we are currently focusing the bulk of our resources on developing new product formulations, and related
new technologies, as we expand marketing and sales efforts relating to our Sol sence products. This work has led to several
new products and additional potential new products. Our efforts in research and development, cosmetic formulating, process engineering
and advanced engineering groups are focused in three major areas: 1) application development for our products; 2) creating or
obtaining additional core materials technologies and/or materials that have the capability to serve multiple skin health-related
markets; and 3) continuing to improve our core technologies to improve manufacturing operations and reduce costs. 

Research
and development expense decreased to 970 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,057 for the same period
in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 research and development expense decreased to 2,746 compared to 3,052
for the same period in 2023. T he decrease is due in large part to
decreased legal costs related to research and development, and salaries in 2024 compared to 2023. 

Selling,
general and administrative expense increased to 1,934 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,695 for the
same period in 2023. The increase is due to an increase in the allowance for credit loss
and increased employee-related costs in 2024 to when compared to 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling,
general and administrative expense decreased to 5,321, compared to 5,951 for the same period in 2023. The
decrease is due to lower legal costs in 2024 when compared to 2023. 

Inflation 

We
believe inflation has had an incremental impact on our costs of operations and financial position to date. However, supplier price
increases and wage and benefit inflation, both of which represent a significant component of our costs of operations, could have
a material effect on our operations and financial position in 2024 if we are unable to pass through any applicable increases under
our present contracts or through to our markets in general. We have begun to increase pricing where possible and continue to adjust
our pricing to the extent supported by the markets we are in, and under any contract limitations we may have.

The
net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increased accounts
receivable and inventory offset by net income and increased customer deposits. Net cash used in investing activities was attributable
to expenditures on capital equipment for all periods presented above. The net cash provided by financing activities was attributable
to the issuance of additional common stock. 

Our
actual future capital requirements in 2024 and beyond will depend on many factors, including customer acceptance of our current
and potential finished Sol sence products, APIs sold as ingredients in to the skin health markets, medical diagnostics
ingredients, and other engineered materials, applications, and products, continued progress in research and development activities
and product testing programs, the magnitude of these activities and programs, and the costs necessary to increase and expand our
manufacturing capabilities and to market and sell these products and ingredients. Other important issues that will drive future
capital requirements will be the development of new markets and new customers as well as the potential for significant unplanned
growth with existing customers. Depending on the success of certain projects, and conditions within the markets supplying labor
and materials for capital equipment, we expect that capital spending relating to currently known capital needs for 2024 will be
between 1 million and 2 million, to be funded by profit from operations, our existing loans and lines of credit, and possible
new debt financing. If those projects are delayed or ultimately prove unsuccessful, or if we fail to be able to support the additional
cost of funding them in the near term, we expect our capital expenditures may fall below the lower end of the range. Similarly,
substantial success in business development projects may cause the actual 2024 capital investment to exceed the top of this range. 

14 

Additional
Consideration 

We
had federal net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately 50 million, and tax effected section 179 carryforwards
of approximately 0.2 million at December 31, 2023. Because the Company may experience ownership changes within
the meaning of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code IRC in connection with any future equity offerings, future utilization
of this carryforward may be subject to certain limitations as defined by the IRC. If not utilized, 44 million of this loss carryforward
will expire between 2024 and 2037. Given changes to the IRC, net operating loss carryforwards generated after January 1, 2018
do not expire, therefore, 5.6 million in net operating losses generated since January 1, 2018 do not expire. We had Illinois
net loss deduction carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately 21.3 million on December 31, 2023. Due to the provisions of
Illinois Public Act 102-0669 signed November 16, 2021, Illinois net loss deductions expire between 2029 and 2042. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purposes of raising capital,
incurring debt or operating our business. We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with entities that
are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability
of capital resources.
