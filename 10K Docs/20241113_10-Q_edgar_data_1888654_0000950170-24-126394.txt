5E ADVANCED MATERIALS, INC. 
 NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 of the rights through ownership in the 5E Boron Americas (Fort Cady) Complex (the Project located in southern California, through its ownership of 5EBA. In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances and transactions, income and expenses and profit and losses resulting from intra-company transactions have been eliminated. 
 million (inclusive of amounts payable and accrued for third-party expenses as of September 30, 2024), and our issuance of the September 2024 Notes (as further described and defined in Note 7 Debt) provided net cash proceeds of approximately million (inclusive of amounts payable and accrued for third-party expenses as of September 30, 2024), each of which improved the Company s cash position, and while the Company continues to operate under a business plan that includes reductions in certain spending, management anticipates the need for additional financing within the next twelve months to maintain a cash balance in excess of the million minimum cash covenant which goes into effect December 31, 2024 (as discussed in No te 7 Debt). If the Company is not able to secure additional financing and the Company s cash balance falls below million after such date, an event of default under the amended and restated note purchase agreement, entered into on September 16, 2024 (as further described in Note 7 Debt) would occur if not cured after 30 days. An event of default would cause the Company s senior secured Convertible Notes (as further described and defined in Note 7 Debt) balance outstanding to become immediately due and payable, for which the Company would not have the resources to repay without additional financing. The receipt of potential funding cannot be considered probable at this time because these plans are not entirely within management's control as of the date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, there exists substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Even if additional financing is successfully consummated, available liquidity may still not be sufficient to eliminate the aforementioned substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business and do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.

million private placement of senior secured convertible notes (the August 2022 Notes with Bluescape Special Situations IV Bluescape ). On January 18, 2024, the Company entered into an amended and restated note purchase agreement (the January 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement which modified certain terms of the August 2022 Notes, including to extend the maturity date of the August 2022 Notes to . On May 28, 2024, the Company entered into a second amendment Amendment No. 2 to the January 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement and agreed, among other things, to (i) issue and sell new senior secured convertible notes in substantially the same form and under the same terms as the August 2022 Notes, as amended, in an aggregate principal amount of million (the June 2024 Notes to Bluescape and Ascend Global Investment Fund SPC for and on behalf of Strategic SP Ascend ), and (ii) amend and restate the January 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement in the form attached as Annex A to Amendment No. 2 (the May 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement ). On September 16, 2024, the Company entered into a third amendment Amendment No. 3 to the January 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement and agreed, among other things, to (i) issue and sell new senior secured convertible notes in substantially the same form and under the same terms as the June 2024 Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of million (the September 2024 Notes and, together with the August 2022 Notes and the June 2024 Notes, the Convertible Notes to Bluescape and Ascend, and (ii) amend and restate the January 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement in the form attached as Annex A to Amendment No. 3 (the September 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement and collectively with the January 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement and the May 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement, the Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement ). As part of the January 2024, May 2024 and September 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreements, the Company incurred approximately million, thousand and thousand of debt issuance costs. At the Company s election, the Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of if paid in cash, and if paid through the issuance of additional notes. Interest is paid on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The Convertible Notes contain a financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain a cash balance of at least million after December 31, 2024 . The Convertible Notes are secured by substantially all of the Company s assets. Convertible Notes - Conversion Terms The Convertible Notes, including accrued interest paid-in-kind, may be converted into shares of the Company s common stock, par value (the Common Stock at any time before the Convertible Notes mature. The August 2022 Notes are convertible into the Company s Common Stock based upon a conversion rate of shares of Common Stock per principal amount of Convertible Notes (the Conversion Rate), representing a conversion price of approximately per share. The June 2024 Notes are convertible into the Company s Common Stock based upon a Conversion Rate of , representing a conversion price of approximately per share. The September 2024 Notes are convertible into the Company s Common Stock based upon a Conversion Rate of shares of Common Stock per principal amount of September 2024 Notes, representing a conversion price of approximately per share. In addition, the Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement provides for certain adjustments to the Conversion Rate to increase the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes (the Additional Shares in the event of certain change of control transactions or other events specified in the Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement (a Make-Whole Fundamental Change ). Accordingly, the Conversion Rate will increase by up to , and Additional Shares per principal amount of August 2022 Notes, June 2024 Notes and September 2024 Notes, respectively, based on the timing of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change and the trading price of the Common Stock at such time or the cash received by holders of the Common Stock in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change. The Conversion Rate applicable to the June 2024 Notes and September 2024 Notes is subject to adjustment if, after the issuance date of the respective Convertible Notes and on or prior to December 31, 2024, the Company sells Common Stock or any other equity-linked securities in one or more transactions at an effective price per share that is less than the respective conversion price then in effect, subject to certain exemptions (a Degressive Issuance ). In the event of a Degressive Issuance, the Conversion Rate applicable to the June 2024 Notes and September 2024 Notes will be adjusted based on the weighted average issuance price of the securities sold in such Degressive Issuance, as set forth in the Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement, the Company will not be permitted to effect any Degressive Issuance that would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate that requires the approval of the Company s stockholders pursuant to the listing standards of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, unless the Company has obtained such stockholder approval before such Degressive Issuance. As part of the August 2024 Equity Offering (as further described and defined in Note 10 Equity), the Degressive Issuance provision applicable to the June 2024 Notes resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate applicable only to the June 2024 Notes from 

 12 

to , and a corresponding increase in the Conversion Rate in the event of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change from to . The September 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement also requires the Company to maintain the effectiveness of registration statements filed with the SEC relating to shares of the Company s Common Stock which may be received by the holders of the Convertible Notes if such Convertible Notes are converted into Common Stock. If the Company fails to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statements through the period in which the Convertible Notes may be converted, the interest rate applicable to the Convertible Notes may be increased by per annum for each 90-day period where such registration statements are not effective, up to a maximum of per annum. Convertible Notes - Derivatives The terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement permits a change to the Conversion Rates applicable to the June 2024 Notes and September 2024 Notes upon a Digressive Issuance by the Company on or before December 31, 2024. As a result, these conversion features were deemed to be embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation and separate accounting as stand-alone derivative instruments (the June 2024 Convertible Note Derivative and September 2024 Convertible Note Derivative, respectively, and together, the Convertible Note Derivatives ). The June 2024 Notes were initially recorded at their face amount of million less debt issuance costs of thousand and the fair value of the June 2024 Convertible Note Derivative, which was determined to be million. Similarly, the September 2024 Notes were initially recorded at their face amount of million less debt issuance costs of thousand and the fair value of the September 2024 Convertible Note Derivative, which was determined to be million. The provisions that result in separate accounting for the Convertible Note Derivatives will expire on December 31, 2024, and accordingly, the fair value of the Convertible Note Derivatives, if any, on such date will be transferred to additional paid-in capital. Refer to Note 8 Convertible Note Derivatives and the discussion immediately below for additional details regarding the fair values of the Convertible Note Derivatives.

The valuation model for the Convertible Notes and related Convertible Note Derivatives require the input of subjective assumptions including expected share price volatility, risk-free interest rate and debt rate. Changes in the input assumptions as well as the Company's underlying share price can materially affect the fair value estimates. Changes in the reported fair value of the Convertible Notes between periods are not recognized in net income and therefore have no effect on reported net income (loss).

On August 27, 2024, the Company completed an offering (the August 2024 Equity Offering of (i) shares (the Shares of Common Stock, (ii) Series A warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of up to shares of Common Stock (the Series A Warrants and (iii) Series B warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of Common Stock (the Series B Warrants , and collectively with the Series A Warrants, the Warrants ). The Shares and Warrants were offered and sold on a combined basis for consideration equating to for one Share and two Warrants. The exercise price for each of the Warrants is per share. This transaction resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately million after deducting the placement agent s fees and other offering expenses (inclusive of amounts payable and accrued as of September 30, 2024). The aggregate net proceeds and issuance costs associated with the August 2024 Equity Offering were allocated to the Shares and Warrants based upon the relative fair value of such items on the offering date. The Series A Warrants and the Series B Warrants are initially exercisable on February 27, 2025. The Series A Warrants will expire on February 27, 2030 and the Series B Warrants will expire on February 27, 2027. The Warrants contain standard adjustments to the exercise price including for stock splits, stock dividends, rights offerings and pro rata distributions. The Warrants also include certain rights upon the occurrence of a fundamental transaction (as described in the Warrants), including the right of the holder thereof to receive from the Company or a successor entity the same type or form of consideration (and in the same proportion) that is being offered and paid to the holders of Common Stock in such fundamental transaction in the amount of the Black Scholes value (as described in the Warrants) of the unexercised portion of the Warrant on the date of the consummation of such fundamental transaction. The Warrants include cashless exercise rights to the extent the resale of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants is not registered under the Securities Act. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company issued approximately thousand and thousand shares of its Common Stock upon the vesting of equity awards. The vesting did not result in any cash proceeds to the Company. 

 14 

million of shares of Common Stock from time to time through the Agents, acting as the Company s sales agents, or directly to one or more of the Agents, acting as principal (the ATM Program ). Neither of the Agents is required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares of the Company s Common Stock, but each has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Distribution Agreement, to use its commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, to sell the shares of Common Stock on the terms agreed upon by such Agent and the Company. The Company did not sell any shares of Common Stock nor receive any proceeds under the Equity Distribution Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024 . As a result of the August 2024 Equity Offering we are precluded from utilizing the ATM Program for one year following the closing of the offering, and as a result approximately thousand of costs previously capitalized for the ATM Program were written-off to General and administrative expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 .

million primarily for engineering services for our proposed commercial-scale facility, drilling services related to wellfield development, raw materials for the operation of our SSF and other services. Litigation On July 17, 2023, the Company filed a complaint (the Complaint against a previous construction contractor in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Eastern Division, alleging, among other things, numerous breaches by the contractor of its contractual obligations to 5EBA under the Procurement and Construction Contract, effective April 26, 2022, by and between 5EBA and the contractor, relating to the construction of the SSF in California (the Contract ). On August 10, 2023, the contractor filed an answer to the Complaint as well as a counterclaim for, among other things, alleged breaches by 5EBA of its contractual obligations to the contractor under the Contract and has requested relief in the approximate amount of million. The Company plans on filing a response disputing the counterclaims asserted by the contractor and reaffirming the grounds for recovery raised in the Complaint. Discovery has begun and is ongoing. An estimate of reasonably possible losses, if any, cannot be made at this time.

 Overview 
 5E Advanced Materials, Inc. is focused on becoming a vertically integrated global leader and supplier of specialty boron and advanced boron derivative materials whose mission is to enable decarbonization, increase food security, and ensure domestic supply of critical materials. We hold 100 of the rights through ownership in the 5E Boron Americas (Fort Cady) Complex (the Project through our wholly owned subsidiary 5E Boron Americas LLC. Our Project is underpinned by a mineral resource that includes boron and lithium, with the boron being contained in a conventional boron mineral known as colemanite. In 2022, our facility was designated as Critical Infrastructure by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Our vision is to safely process boric acid and lithium carbonate through sustainable best practices to enable decarbonization, food security and domestic supply surety. 
 Recent Developments 
 Commercial Team Strategic Hires 
 During October 2024, we hired Mark Zamek as our Vice President of Commercial Products, and Kenneth Hoo as our Vice President of Commercial Products - APAC. Mr. Zamek has over 20 years of direct industry experience, having held various senior roles across sales and marketing functions at the largest global borate producers. Most recently, Mr. Zamek served as a consultant for Eti Maden, where he advised the U.S.-focused boron operations on commercial strategy and market expansion initiatives. Prior to that, Mr. Zamek served in numerous strategic sales and marketing roles for over twenty years with Rio Tinto s U.S. Borax, most recently as Key Global Accounts Manager where he was responsible for managing the company s largest global borates contract. 
 Mr. Hoo has over 17 years of borates industry experience, having held several roles in a sales capacity at the largest global borate producers, as well as consumers. Most recently, Mr. Hoo served as a Sales Manager at Rio Tinto Group, where he specialized in a variety of products, notably borates. Prior to that, Mr. Hoo served in numerous strategic sales roles at borate producers where he accumulated APAC supply chain and logistics expertise while focusing on developing commercial relationships in the Asian market. 
 We believe that the addition of Mr. Zamek and Mr. Hoo to our leadership team will progress our vision of becoming a leading global supplier of boric acid and boron specialty materials. 
 Highlights for the Three Months ended September 30, 2024 
 Operational Highlights 
 Operational Update 
 As of September 30, 2024, production rates at our Small-Scale Facility (the SSF have steadied and, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, we are maintaining production of boric acid at one short ton per day with continuous improvement in production rates and product specification at the facility. Our operations team has successfully programmed crystallization to operate in automatic mode such that distillation occurs based on feed concentration, improving both boric acid consistency and quality. Recently, the SSF s belt filter spray nozzle systems were optimized to maintain sulfur content below 100 ppm, which is lower than levels specified by customers in our qualification program. 
 19 

As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have begun to remove metal salts as calcium levels and metal salts have lagged boric acid leach rates. Calcium content as of October 2024 has increased to greater than 20,000 ppm, necessitating the production of a calcium-based by-product. As we assess commercial scale engineering, the anticipated recovery solution after removal of calcium is expected to reinforce our confidence levels of solution feed profiles that inform raw material utilizations that drive operating expenses, which we believe will enable us to have a more refined view of our future capital needs and operating expense profile. We continue to evaluate calcium chloride as a potential byproduct and have tested and produced samples of a 38 calcium chloride solution that we believe are representative of what could be produced on a commercial scale. 
 We anticipate maintaining boric acid production rates of one short ton per day for the foreseeable future while the SSF continues to provide the necessary data to inform and refine the design of our commercial-scale facility, explore ways to optimize our wellfield design and related capital costs, and progress our customer qualification program. 
 Financing Highlights 
 August 2024 Equity Offering 
 On August 27, 2024, we completed an offering (the August 2024 Equity Offering of (i) 5,333,333 shares (the Shares of our common stock, par value 0.01 per share Common Stock ), (ii) Series A warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of up to 5,333,333 shares of Common Stock (the Series A Warrants and (iii) Series B warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,333,333 shares of Common Stock (the Series B Warrants , and collectively with the Series A Warrants, the Warrants ). The Shares and Warrants were offered and sold on a combined basis for consideration equating to 0.75 for one Share and two Warrants. The exercise price for each of the Warrants is 0.7981 per share. 
 The Series A Warrants and the Series B Warrants are initially exercisable on February 27, 2025. The Series A Warrants will expire on February 27, 2030 and the Series B Warrants will expire on February 27, 2027. The Warrants contain standard adjustments to the exercise price including for stock splits, stock dividends, rights offerings and pro rata distributions. The Warrants also include certain rights upon the occurrence of a fundamental transaction (as described in the Warrants), including the right of the holder thereof to receive from the Company or a successor entity the same type or form of consideration (and in the same proportion) that is being offered and paid to the holders of Common Stock in such fundamental transaction in the amount of the Black Scholes value (as described in the Warrants) of the unexercised portion of the Warrant on the date of the consummation of such fundamental transaction. The Warrants include cashless exercise rights to the extent the resale of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants is not registered under the Securities Act. 
 In connection with the August 2024 Equity Offering, we agreed not to issue any shares of Common Stock (or securities exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock) for a period of 90 days following the closing of the offering, or to enter into any variable rate transactions for one year following the closing of the offering. 
 The net proceeds to us for the August 2024 Equity Offering were approximately 3.0 million after deducting the placement agent s fees and other offering expenses payable by us (inclusive of amounts payable and accrued as of September 30, 2024). 
 September 2024 Notes Offering 
 On September 16, 2024, pursuant to an amended and restated note purchase agreement (the September 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement ), we issued and sold new senior secured convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount of 6.0 million (the September 2024 Notes ), comprised of 3.0 million of September 2024 Notes to Bluescape Special Situations IV Bluescape ), and 1.5 million of September 2024 Notes to each of Ascend Global Investment Fund SPC for and on behalf of Strategic SP Ascend and Meridian Investments Corporation Meridian ). The net proceeds to us for the September 2024 Notes Offering were approximately 5.5 million after deducting issuance costs and fees payable by us (inclusive of amounts payable and accrued for third-party expenses as of September 30, 2024). For additional information, see Note 7 Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 EXIM Bank Letter of Interest 
 In September 2024, we received a non-binding Letter of Interest LOI from the Export-Import Bank of the United States EXIM ). The LOI outlines the potential for the creation of a debt facility of up to 285 million, which would be utilized for commercial-scale development and construction of 5E s Boron Americas Complex. The potential debt funding package would carry a repayment tenor of up to 15 years under EXIM s Make More in America Initiative, a part of a whole-of-government effort to strengthen America s supply chains, support American jobs and boost America s ability to compete with countries like China, especially in sectors critical to national security. We believe the LOI demonstrates a growing awareness and commitment by the U.S. government to securing an integrated boron supply chain. 
 20 

We expect to submit a formal application to EXIM in calendar year 2025, at which point we expect EXIM would begin the necessary due diligence to determine if a final commitment may be issued. A final commitment, if any, must comply with EXIM s policies and eligibility requirements, and will depend on meeting EXIM's underwriting criteria, authorization process, finalization and satisfaction of terms and conditions. The LOI does not represent a funding commitment nor an indication of financing or project viability and there is no guarantee that we will secure the EXIM funding commitment. 
 Financing Transactions Liquidity Considerations 
 Although the August 2024 Equity Offering and issuance of September 2024 Notes improved our cash position by providing an aggregate of approximately 8.6 million of net proceeds after issuance costs and fees to the Company (inclusive of amounts payable and accrued as of September 30, 2024), and we continue to operate under a business plan that includes reductions in certain spending, we will need additional financing in order to continue as a going concern and maintain a cash balance in excess of the 7.5 million minimum cash covenant contained in the September 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement (as discussed in Note 7 Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). An event of default under the September 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement would cause all of our Convertible Notes to become immediately due and payable, for which we would not have the resources to repay without additional financing. The receipt of potential funding cannot be considered probable at this time because these plans are not entirely within management's control as of the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, there exists substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Even if additional financing is successfully consummated, available liquidity may still not be sufficient to eliminate the aforementioned substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Refer to the "Going Concern" discussion within Note 1 Basis of Financial Statement Presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources below for more information.

 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Project expenses 
 Project expenses include drilling, plug and abandonment, site-preparation, engineering, consumables, testing and sampling, hydrology, permits, surveys, and other expenses associated with further progressing our Project. Prior to April 1, 2024, Project expenses also included non-labor related costs incurred to prepare for the operation of the SSF, as these costs were incurred prior to the SSF being placed into operation. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, project expenses decreased 29 thousand, or 2 , versus the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of (i) a decrease in Environmental Protection Agency compliance costs 0.4 million), (ii) a decrease in testing and analysis costs 0.2 million ), (iii) a decrease in insurance costs 0.1 million), and (iv) a reduction in expenses incurred relating to our plug and abandonment program to prepare the wellfield for injection 
 21 

operations 0.1 million). These decreases were offset by increases in (i) materials and drilling services for the installation of additional observation wells 0.5 million), and (ii) an increase in site related costs 0.2 million). 
 Small-scale facility operating costs 
 Small-scale facility operating costs consists of raw materials, salaries and benefits for employees that are directly responsible for the operation of the SSF and maintenance and upkeep related to the SSF after April 1, 2024. Prior to April 1, 2024, such costs were reported within either Project expenses or General and administrative expenses as the small-scale facility had not yet been placed into operation. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Small-scale facility operating costs consisted of (i) salaries and benefits for our employees directly responsible for operating the SSF 1.2 million), (ii) raw materials necessary to operate the SSF and produce boric acid 0.2 million), and (iii) maintenance, upkeep and other costs incurred for the operation of the SSF 0.2 million). There were no comparable expenses for the prior year as the SSF had not yet been placed into service and such costs were reported as either Project expenses or General and administrative expenses, as appropriate. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses include professional fees, costs associated with marketing, on-going SEC and public company costs, public relations, rent, salaries, share-based compensation and other expenses. Prior to April 1, 2024, all salaries and benefits for the entire organization were reported in general and administrative expenses. After April 1, 2024, the date which we began commercial operation of the SSF, salaries and benefits for employees that are directly responsible for the operation of the SSF are reported in Small-scale facility operating costs. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.2 million, or 21 , versus the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to (i) 1.2 million of salaries and benefits for personnel responsible for the operation of the SSF, which are now reported as Small-scale facility operating costs, (ii) a reduction in professional and legal fees 0.4 million), (iii) a reduction on incentive compensation related costs 0.4 million), and (iv) a reduction in marketing related costs 0.1 million). These decreases were partially offset by an increase in share-based compensation costs, which was primarily the result of the acceleration of certain awards in accordance with an employee s severance agreement 0.8 million). 
 Research and development 
 Research and development expense includes costs incurred under research agreements with Georgetown University and Boston College that aim to enhance the performance of permanent magnets through increased use of boron. Both engagements were completed during the second fiscal quarter of 2024. Therefore, we incurred no research and development costs in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense 
 Depreciation and amortization relates to use of our SSF, injection and recovery wells, owned or leased vehicles, buildings and equipment and the accretion of our asset retirement obligations. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, depreciation and amortization expense increased 4.9 million versus the comparable period in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to placing the SSF and its related injection and recovery wells, facilities and equipment into service as of April 1, 2024 corresponding with the commencement of commercial operations. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income is derived from the investment of our excess cash and cash equivalents in short-term (original maturities of three months or less) investments of highly liquid treasury bills and certificates of deposit. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income decreased 109 thousand, or 83 , versus the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. Such decrease correspond to decreases in our average cash and cash equivalent balances between the periods. 
 Other income 
 Other income is derived from the third-party use of our hydrology wells and the sale of scrap and other materials. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income decreased 2 thousand, or 67 , versus the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease primarily relates to reduced third-party use of our hydrology wells compared to the prior year. 
 Derivative gain 
 Derivative gain (loss) results from changes in the fair value of the embedded conversion features relating to degressive issuance provisions originally contained in the May 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement, and subsequently incorporated into and continue under the September 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement as it relates to the June 2024 Convertible Note Derivative and September 2024 Convertible Note Derivative that are required to be bifurcated and accounted for 
 22 

separately as stand-alone derivative instruments (as discussed within Note 7 and Note 8 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 The unrealized derivative gain (loss) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in our stock price during the period, which resulted in a gain on the June 2024 Convertible Note Derivative. Our stock price on June 28, 2024 (the last trading day prior to the end of our prior fiscal year) and September 30, 2024 (the end of the current fiscal quarter) was 1.21 and 0.54, respectively. The observed decline in our stock price, particularly to a price below the Conversion Price for the June 2024 Notes, resulted in a decline in the value of the embedded conversion feature and a resulting derivative gain of 2.4 million. This derivative gain was offset, to a lesser extent, by a loss with respect to the September 2024 Convertible Note Derivative during the same period. The unrealized derivative loss was primarily due to an increase in our stock price from 0.50 on September 16, 2024 (the issuance date of the September 2024 Notes) to 0.54 on September 30, 2024 (the end of the current fiscal quarter). There were no comparable embedded conversion features requiring bifurcation and separate accounting in the comparative period in the prior fiscal year and therefore there was no related Derivative gain (loss). Future changes in the fair value of the embedded conversion features prior to their expiration will affect future net income, but will not have any effect on cash flows. On December 31, 2024, the conversion features associated with the June 2024 Notes and September 2024 Notes that results in separate accounting will expire and the fair value of such derivatives, if any, will be transferred to additional paid-in capital on such date. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense primarily relates to interest expense incurred on the Convertible Notes and is net of amounts capitalized to construction-in-progress. Prior to the execution of an amended and restated note purchase agreement on January 18, 2024 (the January 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement ), the August 2022 Notes accrued interest at a rate of 6 when interest was paid-in-kind through the issuance of additional notes. Subsequent to the January 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement and continuing under the September 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement, the August 2022 Notes accrue interest at a rate of 10 when interest is paid-in-kind through the issuance of additional notes, with such rate also applying to the June 2024 Notes and September 2024 Notes. We also recognize interest expense for the amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization of debt discounts on the Convertible Notes. As part of the modification of the terms of our debt associated with the January 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement, the modified debt was recognized at fair value on our balance sheet which eliminated the prior debt discount that was amortized to interest expense. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased 0.4 million, or 21 , versus the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to the combined effect of interest accruing (i) at 10 under the terms of our January 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement compared to 6 under our prior agreement in the prior period, (ii) on a 12 million aggregate increase in the principal balance of Convertible Notes resulting from the issuance of the June 2024 Notes and September 2024 Notes, and (iii) on 2.1 million and 3.4 million of interest that was paid-in-kind during February of 2024 and August of 2024, respectively (for a combined impact of 0.9 million increase in interest expense). Interest expense also increased as a result of capitalizing less interest expense to construction-in-progress between periods as a result of the SSF being placed into service on April 1, 2024 and therefore no longer eligible for interest capitalization (an impact of 0.6 million increase in interest expense). These increases were partially offset by the effects of a reduction in the amount of debt discount and debt issuance costs amortization primarily resulting from the write-off of the remaining unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs (established August 26, 2022) and corresponding elimination of the amortization of such amounts in connection with the accounting for the January 2024 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement 1.1 million reduction in interest expense). 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 6.9 million and working capital of 0.6 million compared to 4.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of 2.9 million as of June 30, 2024. Our predominant source of cash has been generated through equity financing from issuances of our common stock and equity-linked securities, including our Convertible Notes. Since inception, we have not generated revenues, and as such, have relied on equity financing and equity-linked instruments to fund our operating and investing activities. We maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits at certain of these institutions may exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions.

 Cash Flows Used For Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for each of the above periods was primarily the result of general and administrative costs (exclusive of share-based compensation), costs incurred in furthering the Project, preparing us for the operation of the SSF, and operating costs of the SSF after commercial operations commenced on April 1, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we used 6.4 million of cash for operating activities, a decrease of approximately 0.5 million or 7 compared to the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in cash used in operations during the current period primarily results from the combined decrease in General and administrative and Small-scale facility operating costs, net of non-cash share-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2024 versus the prior fiscal year (refer to the discussion of year-over-year changes in Project expenses and General and administrative expenses above for additional details). 
 Cash Flows Used For Investing Activities 
 Our cash flows used for investing activities primarily relate to equipment purchases, engineering, the construction and commissioning of our SSF, and FEL-2 engineering related to our commercial-scale facility. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we used 0.4 million of cash for investing activities, a decrease of approximately 1.2 million, or 75 , compared to the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to engineering services for FEL-2 engineering of our commercial-scale facility. Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to final construction and commissioning of our SSF. 
 Cash Flows From Financing Activities 
 Our cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to equity and equity-linked financing transactions to fund our business and operations. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were the result of (i) approximately 3.1 million of net proceeds received from the August 2024 Equity Offering, after recognition of the related costs and fees (exclusive of amounts payable and accrued as of September 30, 2024), and (ii) approximately 5.7 million of proceeds received from the issuance of September 2024 Notes, after recognition of the related costs and fees (exclusive of amounts payable and accrued as of September 30, 2024). Cash flows used in financing activities during the comparable prior fiscal year were the result of payments on the Company s vehicle loans. 
 Convertible Notes Summary 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes of approximately 81.1 million outstanding. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company s Common Stock, are secured by substantially all of the Company s assets and mature on August 15, 2028, as further described below. Additional details related to the Convertible Notes can be found in Note 7 Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The August 2022 Notes are convertible into 66,261,621 shares of Common Stock (including principal and accrued interest paid-in-kind until maturity), and may be convertible into a maximum of an additional 33,130,816 Additional Shares upon the occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change. 
 The June 2024 Notes are convertible into 6,252,368 shares of Common Stock (including principal and accrued interest paid-in-kind until maturity), and may be convertible into a maximum of an additional 3,126,184 Additional Shares upon the occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change. 
 The September 2024 Notes are convertible into 9,380,671 shares of Common Stock (including principal and accrued interest paid-in-kind until maturity), and may be convertible into a maximum of an additional 3,908,615 Additional Shares upon the occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change. 
 24 

Equity Offerings 
 On August 27, 2024, we completed the August 2024 Equity Offering of (i) 5,333,333 Shares of Common Stock, (ii) Series A Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of up to 5,333,333 shares of Common Stock, and (iii) Series B Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,333,333 shares of Common Stock. The Shares and Warrants were offered and sold on a combined basis for consideration equating to 0.75 for one Share and two Warrants. 
 The Series A Warrants and the Series B Warrants are initially exercisable on February 27, 2025. The Series A Warrants will expire on February 27, 2030 and the Series B Warrants will expire on February 27, 2027. The Warrants contain standard adjustments to the exercise price including for stock splits, stock dividends, rights offerings and pro rata distributions. The Warrants also include certain rights upon the occurrence of a fundamental transaction (as described in the Warrants), including the right of the holder thereof to receive from the Company or a successor entity the same type or form of consideration (and in the same proportion) that is being offered and paid to the holders of Common Stock in such fundamental transaction in the amount of the Black Scholes value (as described in the Warrants) of the unexercised portion of the Warrant on the date of the consummation of such fundamental transaction. The Warrants include cashless exercise rights to the extent the resale of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants is not registered under the Securities Act. 
 2024 Equity Distribution Agreement 
 On March 28, 2024, we entered into an equity distribution agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement with Canaccord Genuity LLC and D.A. Davidson Co. (the Agents pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to 15.0 million of shares of our Common Stock from time to time through the Agents, acting as our sales agents, or directly to one or more of the Agents, acting as principal (the ATM Program ). 
 Neither of the Agents is required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares of our Common Stock, but each has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Distribution Agreement, to use its commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, to sell the shares of Common Stock on the terms agreed upon by such Agent and the Company. 
 We did not sell any shares of common stock nor receive any proceeds under the Equity Distribution Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024. As a result of the August 2024 Equity Offering, we are precluded from utilizing the ATM program until after August 27, 2025. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Our material short-term cash requirements include general and administrative expenses including recurring payroll and benefit obligations for our employees, costs necessary to further engineering of our proposed commercial-scale complex, operating costs for the SSF, project related costs, payments under certain lease agreements and working capital needs. Our long-term material cash requirements from currently known obligations include repayment of outstanding borrowings and interest payment obligations under our Convertible Notes (which may be avoided to the extent the Convertible Notes are converted to shares of our Common Stock and/or interest is paid-in-kind) and future obligations to reclaim, remediate, or otherwise restore properties to a condition that existed prior to our operations. Refer to the Construction in Progress, Asset Retirement Obligations, Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities, Long-term Debt and Commitments and Contingencies footnotes in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on certain of these expenditures and obligations. 
 Contractual Commitments and Contingencies 
 Purchase Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had purchase order commitments of approximately 4.3 million primarily for engineering services for our proposed commercial-scale facility, drilling services related to wellfield development, raw materials for the operation of our small-scale facility and other services. 
 Future Capital Requirements 
 Over the next 12 months we have the following plans that will require additional capital: 
 Operate the SSF to provide the necessary data for our commercial-scale facility and progress our customer qualification program; 

Progress FEL-2, FEL-3, and detail engineering; 

Optimize well-field design in an effort to reduce future mining capital and operational expenditure through various drilling techniques such as directional, horizontal and radial drilling; 

25 

Pursue and optimize infrastructure capital expenditures for our larger-scale facility which could include expansion of non-potable water resources, upgrading shore power, connection to a natural gas network, and constructing new access roads into and out of the location for our larger-scale facility; and 

Further define our advanced materials strategy with consideration to engineering and repurposing our SSF to produce boron advanced materials once sufficient data has been obtained for flow sheet optimization and the production of product for customer qualification. 

Although the August 2024 Equity Offering and issuance of the September 2024 Notes, each discussed above, improved our cash position, and we continue to operate under a business plan that includes reductions in certain spending, we will need additional financing in order to continue as a going concern and maintain a cash balance in excess of the 7.5 million minimum cash covenant contained in the Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement. Absent additional financing as outlined above, we may no longer be able to meet our ongoing obligations, continue operations or achieve the milestones outlined above. If we are not able to secure additional financing cash flows and our cash balance falls below 7.5 million after December 31, 2024, an event of default under the Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement would occur if not cured after 30 days. An event of default would cause our Convertible Notes balance outstanding to become immediately due and payable, for which we would not have the resources to repay without additional financing. 
 We intend to explore different potential financing strategies to help support the growth of our business and execution of our business plan, including equity or debt financing, government funding or grants, private capital, royalty agreements or customer prepayments, or other strategic alliances with third parties. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to secure additional financing on adequate terms, in a timely manner, or at all. 
 The receipt of potential funding cannot be considered probable at this time because these plans are not entirely within management s control as of the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, there exists substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. Even if additional financing is successfully consummated, available liquidity may still not be sufficient to eliminate the aforementioned substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Refer to the Going Concern discussion within Note 1 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 A complete discussion of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) ASU 2023-07 ). ASU 2023-07 is intended to enhances reportable segment disclosure requirements, including significant segment expenses and interim disclosures. The guidance allows for disclosure of multiple measures of a segment s profit or loss, and it requires that public entities with a single reportable segment provide all disclosures required by ASU 2023-07 and all existing disclosures required by the existing segment disclosure guidance. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively, and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2023-07 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ). ASU 2023-09 is intended to improve income tax disclosures primarily through enhanced disclosure of income tax rate reconciliation items, and disaggregation of income (loss) from continuing operations, income tax expense (benefit) and income taxes paid, net disclosures by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, among others. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2023-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and our plan for adoption, including the adoption date and transition method. 
 
 In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses ASU 2024-03 ), which requires the disaggregation of certain expenses in the notes of the financials, to provide enhanced transparency into the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027 and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2024-03 will have on our related disclosures, including the adoption date and transition method. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item 3. 
 26 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Interim Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in the evaluation for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Except as disclosed in Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as of the date of this filing, we are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings, nor are we aware of any material civil proceeding or government authority contemplating any legal proceeding, and to our knowledge, no such proceedings by or against us have been threatened. We anticipate that we and our subsidiaries may from time to time become subject to various claims, legal proceedings, governmental inspections, audits, or investigations arising in the ordinary course of business. It is not feasible to predict the outcome of any such proceedings, and we cannot assure that their ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Except as described below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. You should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and future results. Additional risk and uncertainties not currently known to us may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. 
 Exercise of our outstanding Warrants will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our Common Stock. 
 In August 2024, we issued and sold warrants to purchase an aggregate of 10,666,666 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 0.7981 per share, including 5,333,333 Series A Warrants and 5,333,333 Series B Warrants, which will be initially exercisable on February 27, 2025. The Series A Warrants will expire on February 27, 2030 and the Series B Warrants will expire on February 27, 2027. 
 The exercise of some or all of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and increase the number of shares of common stock eligible for resale in the public market. Any sales in the public market of the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise of the warrants, or the anticipation of such exercises and sales, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Additionally, the existence of the warrants may encourage short selling by market participants because the exercise of the warrants could be used to satisfy short positions, or the anticipated exercise of the warrants for shares of common stock could depress the price of our common stock. 
 Nasdaq may de-list our securities from its exchange, which could limit investors ability to transact in our securities, subject us to additional trading restrictions and substantially increase the number of shares issuable upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes . 
 We are required to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market and if we fail to satisfy such continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our securities. For example, on September 12, 2024, we received written notice from Nasdaq (the Notice notifying us that, for the prior 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). The Notice had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have a period of 180 calendar days, or until March 11, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days as required under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) (unless the Nasdaq staff exercises its discretion to extend this ten-day period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(H)) during the 180-day period prior to March 11, 2025). 
 If we do not regain compliance by March 11, 2025, we may be eligible for an additional 180-calendar day compliance period by transferring the listing of our common stock to the Nasdaq Capital Market and satisfying certain other requirements. If we fail to regain compliance during the compliance period (including a second compliance period provided by a transfer to the Nasdaq Capital Market, if applicable), then Nasdaq will notify us of its determination to delist our common stock, at which point we may appeal Nasdaq s delisting determination to a Nasdaq hearing panel. 
 We intend to actively monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and will consider all available options to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, which may include transferring the listing to the Nasdaq Capital Market and/or seeking stockholder approval to effect a reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance that any such reverse stock split, if approved by the stockholders and implemented, would increase the market price of our common stock in proportion to the reverse split ratio or result in a sustained increase in the market price of our common stock. In addition, it is possible that the reduced number of issued shares of common stock resulting from such a reverse stock split could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock. There can also be no assurance that we will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement during the 180-day compliance period, 
 28 

secure a second 180-day period to regain compliance, maintain compliance with the other Nasdaq listing requirements, or be successful in appealing any delisting determination. 
 If our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq in the future, it is unlikely that we will be able to re-list our common stock on another national securities exchange and, as a result, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this occurs, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 
 a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock; 

a determination that our common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, which could result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock; 

more limited news and analyst coverage for us; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

Additionally, a delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq would constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change under our Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement (each as defined below), thereby substantially increasing the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of our outstanding Convertible Notes. 
 Delisting also could result in, among other things, a loss of investor confidence or interest in strategic transactions or opportunities, us being subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities, and difficulty in recruiting and retaining personnel through equity incentive awards. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities 
 Except as previously disclosed in Current Reports on Form 8-K, there were no unregistered sales of equity securities for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 
 None. 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None. 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 Not applicable as we do not currently operate any mines subject to the U.S. Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 
 Item 5. Other Information. 
 (a)	Disclosure in lieu of reporting on a Current Report on Form 8-K. 
 None. 
 (b)	Material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to the board of directors. 
 None. 
 (c)	Insider Trading Arrangements and Policies. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , none of the Company's directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) or any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
