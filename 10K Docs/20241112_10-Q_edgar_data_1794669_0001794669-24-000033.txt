We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report, including, without limitation, statements relating to our position as a leader within our industry; our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans; the impact of changes in TRA liability (as defined herein); the anticipated benefits of and costs associated with recent acquisitions; and objectives of management for future operations and activities, including, among others, statements regarding expected growth, international expansion, future capital expenditures, debt covenant compliance, financing activities, debt service obligations, and the timing of any of the foregoing, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, should, expect, plan, anticipate, could, intend, target, project, contemplate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, though not all forward-looking statements can be identified by such terms or expressions. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are subject to a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those factors described in the sections titled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed on February 29, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). 
 Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report and the documents that we reference herein completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.

 million (the Settlement Line ).

different models: (1) a sponsorship model and (2) a direct member model. In the U.S., the Company operates under the sponsorship model and outside the U.S. the Company primarily operates under the direct member model. The Company s operations outside the U.S. are primarily related to the business of Finaro, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Sponsorship Model 
 In the U.S., the Company operates under the sponsorship model. In order for the Company to provide payment processing services, Visa, MasterCard and other payment networks require sponsorship by a member clearing bank. The Company has an agreement with banks and financial institutions (the Sponsoring Member ), to provide sponsorship services to the Company. The sponsorship services allow the Company to route transactions under the Sponsoring Members membership to clear card transactions through card networks. Under this model, the standards of the payment networks restrict the Company from performing funds settlement and require that these funds be in the possession of the Sponsoring Member until the merchant is funded. Accordingly, settlement assets and obligations resulting from the submission of settlement files to the network or cash received from the network in advance of funding the network are the responsibility of the Sponsoring Member and are not recorded on the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Direct Member Model 
 The Company s European and U.K. business (previously known as Finaro) operates as a full acquirer and without a sponsor bank. Under the direct member model, the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets include settlement assets and liabilities that represent balances arising from the settlement process which involves the transferring of funds between card issuers, payment networks, processors, and merchants, as well as collateral held to manage merchant credit risk. As a processor, the Company facilitates the clearing and settlement activity for the merchant and records settlement assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets upon processing a payment transaction. Settlement assets represent cash received or amounts receivable primarily from payment networks or bank partners. Settlement liabilities primarily represent amounts payable to merchants. Settlement assets are in excess of Settlement liabilities due to prefunding provided to certain merchants. 
 Amounts included on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as Collateral held by card networks relate to collateral required by the card networks to operate as a direct member.

The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was different than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21 primarily due to the million discrete tax benefit related to the valuation allowance release and resulting additional deferred tax assets related to the TRA liability on Shift4 Payments, Inc., the net income allocated to the noncontrolling interest, and a million tax benefit related to the valuation allowance release on certain corporate subsidiaries. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was different than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21 primarily due to the net income allocated to the noncontrolling interest and the full valuation allowances on Shift4 Payments, Inc. and certain corporate subsidiaries in the U.S. In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes a million tax benefit related to the valuation allowance release due to a legal entity restructuring and a million tax benefit related to the valuation allowance release due to acquired deferred tax liabilities from Focus POS Systems Focus ). 
 In prior periods, the Company maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of Shift4 Payments, Inc. which are comprised primarily of differences in the book and tax basis of Shift4 Payments, Inc. s investment in Shift4 Payments, LLC. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets on income tax returns. In prior periods, management had determined that its net deferred tax assets were not more likely than not going to be realized due to existence of significant negative evidence that the Company was in a three-year cumulative loss position. Considering this and other factors, Shift4 Payments, Inc. s full valuation allowance was maintained through the period ended June 30, 2024. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, management assessed the realizability of deferred tax assets and concluded that it is more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets will be realized and that a full valuation allowance is no longer required. The assessment included the fact that as of September 30, 2024, the Company is no longer in a three-year cumulative loss position and is projecting sufficient income in future periods to realize its deferred tax assets. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on the portion of deferred tax assets that require capital gains income because there are no current projections of capital gains income at this time.

 Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures 
 The following table sets forth our key performance indicators and non-GAAP measures for the periods presented: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 End-to-end payment volume 43,483.9 27,933.0 116,919.8 76,983.4 Gross revenue less network fees 365.1 243.0 949.4 671.1 EBITDA (122.4) 100.9 101.8 248.5 Adjusted EBITDA 187.4 124.5 471.5 323.8 
 End-to-end payment volume 
 End-to-end payment volume is defined as the total dollar amount of payments that we deliver for settlement on behalf of our merchants. Included in end-to-end volume are dollars routed via our international payments platform and alternative payment methods, including cryptocurrency and stock donations, plus volume we route to one or more third party merchant acquirers on behalf of strategic enterprise merchant relationships. This volume does not include volume processed through our legacy gateway-only offering. 
 Gross revenue less network fees, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 We use supplemental measures of our performance which are derived from our consolidated financial information but which are not presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include: gross revenue less network fees, which includes interchange and assessment fees; earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.

Table of Contents 

 Gross revenue less network fees represents a key performance metric that management uses to measure changes in the mix and value derived from our customer base as we continue to execute our strategy to expand our reach to serve larger, complex merchants. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is the primary financial performance measure used by management to evaluate its business and monitor results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA further adjusted for certain non-cash and other nonrecurring items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations. These adjustments include acquisition, restructuring and integration costs, revaluation of contingent liabilities, unrealized gains or losses on investments in securities, changes in TRA liability, equity-based compensation expense, and foreign exchange and other nonrecurring items. The financial impact of certain elements of these activities is often significant to our overall financial performance and can adversely affect the comparability of our operating results and investors ability to analyze the business from period to period. 
 We use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide our stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Quarterly Report. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of gross revenue less network fees, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented below. We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented. In future periods, we may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items. 
 Reconciliations of gross revenue less network fees, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We have historically sourced our liquidity requirements primarily with cash flow from operations and, when needed, with debt or equity financing. The principal uses for liquidity have been acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and debt service. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balance was 1,426.4 million, of which approximately 135.5 million was held outside of the U.S. by our foreign legal entities. In addition, Settlement assets includes 169.0 million of cash that will be used to settle merchant liabilities. The cash included within Settlement assets is typically paid to merchants within a few days of receipt in order to settle related liabilities. 
 We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Shift4 Payments, Inc. is a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of its own. As a result, Shift4 Payments, Inc. s ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock, if any, is dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from Shift4 Payments, LLC. The amounts available to Shift4 Payments, Inc. to pay cash dividends are subject to the covenants and distribution restrictions in its subsidiaries agreements governing its indebtedness, including covenants in such agreements providing that the payments of dividends or other distributions are subject to annual limitations based on our market capitalization. 
 The following table sets forth summary cash flow information for the periods presented:

 Operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in other assets and liabilities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities of 354.9 million was primarily a result of net income of 155.2 million adjusted for non-cash expenses, including change in TRA liability of 294.2 million, depreciation and amortization of 213.1 million and equity-based compensation of 51.4 million, partially offset by deferred income taxes of (300.1) million, unrealized gain on investments in securities of (21.6) million and an impact from working capital items of (52.6) million. Settlement assets includes both cash and receivables from card networks. From period to period, the mix of cash and receivables included in Settlement assets may change, driving increases or decreases in operating cash flow. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities of 283.0 million was primarily a result of net income of 103.7 million adjusted for non-cash expenses, including depreciation and amortization of 152.7 million, equity-based compensation of 46.4 million, revaluation of contingent liabilities of 21.5 million, and unrealized gain on investments in securities of (11.5) million. This was partially offset by an impact from working capital items of (39.1) million. 
 Investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities includes cash paid for acquisitions, residual commission buyouts, purchases of property, plant and equipment, purchases of equipment to be leased, purchases of intangible assets, investments in securities, and capitalized software development costs. 
 Net cash used in investing acti vities was 435.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 284.1 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 151.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily the result of a 269.6 million increase in net cash paid for acquisitions. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 950.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1,074.9 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 124.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the 1,100.0 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2032 Senior Notes in 2024 and a 60.9 million decrease in payments for the repurchase of common stock, partially offset by 70.8 million of bank deposits being returned to depositors in 2024. 
 Convertible Notes and Senior Notes 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 2,872.5 million total principal amount of debt outstanding, including 1,100.0 million of 2032 Senior Notes, 690.0 million of 2025 Convertible Notes, 632.5 million of 2027 Convertible Notes, and 450.0 million of 2026 Senior Notes. 
 
 Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility

The Revolving Credit Facility matures on September 5, 2029. The Credit Agreement requires periodic interest payments until maturity. 
 Loans incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at our option at either the SOFR rate of 2.00 per year or the alternate base rate (the highest of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50 , or the prime rate announced from time to time in The Wall Street Journal) of 1.00 per year Applicable Rate ). The Applicable Rate varies depending on our total leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The alternate base rate is subject to a zero percent floor. In addition, we are required to pay a commitment fee under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder at a rate of 0.25 per year. We are also subject to customary letter of credit and agency fees. The Revolving Credit Facility has a borrowing capacity of 450.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.

 Settlement Line Agreement 
 On September 30, 2024 we entered into the Settlement Line Credit Agreement (the Settlement Line Agreement ), by and between Shift4 LLC, as the borrower, and Citizens Bank, N.A. Citizens ), as the lender, providing for a settlement line of credit with an aggregate available amount of up to 100.0 million (the Settlement Line ). Draws under the Settlement Line bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either (x) a daily simple SOFR based rate (subject to a 0.0 floor), plus an applicable margin of 0.75 , or (y) to the extent required by the Settlement Line Agreement upon the occurrence of certain specified events, an alternate base rate (equal to the highest of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50 , the daily simple SOFR rate (subject to a 0.0 floor) plus 1.00 , and the prime rate announced by Citizens from time to time). In addition to making periodic interest payments on the principal amount of outstanding draws under the Settlement Line, we are required to pay an unused fee under the Settlement Line in respect of the unused availability thereunder at a rate equal to 0.15 per annum. The purpose of the Settlement Line is to provide financing for certain settlement obligations of Shift4 LLC s merchants and to eliminate the requirement for cash collateral under the sponsorship agreement with Citizens (the Sponsorship Agreement ), which was amended in conjunction with the closing of the settlement line agreement. There were no borrowings under the Settlement Line as of September 30, 2024. The Settlement Line is scheduled to mature on September 29, 2025, subject to extensions. 
 Covenants 
 The Company expects to be in compliance with such financial covenants for at least 12 months following the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Stock repurchases 
 In May 2024, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program (the May 2024 Program ), pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to 500.0 million of our Class A common stock through December 31, 2025 . The May 2024 Program replaces our prior stock repurchase program from December 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we repurchased 528,888 shares of Class A common stock for 35.9 million , including commissions paid, at an average price paid of 67.77 per share. As of September 30, 2024 , 464.1 million remains available under the May 2024 Program. 
 
 Cash Requirements 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and into the foreseeable future based on our current operating plan. Our material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: 
 Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 2,872.5 million of fixed rate debt principal outstanding, including the 690.0 million of 2025 Convertible Notes that mature in December 2025. Future interest payments associated with the outstanding debt total 655.5 million, with 98.2 million payable within twelve months. 
 Contingent Liabilities 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of contingent liabilities to potentially be paid out in cash was 40.3 million, with 21.0 million payable within twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum amount of contingent liabilities to potentially be paid out in cash was 57.9 million, with 21.0 million payable within twelve months. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods described is based on our audited consolidated financial statements, and our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, each of which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these historical financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP and does not require management s judgment in its application, while in other cases, significant judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards the allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions. We consider these policies requiring significant management judgment to be critical accounting policies, which are:

 Business combinations and the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities; 
 Impairment assessments; 
 Useful lives of equipment for lease, property, plant and equipment, residual commission buyouts, capitalized customer acquisition costs, and intangible assets; and

 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for the release of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and related impact on the TRA liability. See Note 13 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details. 
 We have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in Note 1 in the notes to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are subject to risks relating to interest rates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 2,872.5 million of fixed rate debt principal outstanding with a fair value of 3,088.1 million. Since these notes bear interest at fixed rates, they do not result in any risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes can fluctuate as interest rates change. We may be subject to interest rate risk at the time of refinancing any fixed rate debt. 
 We also have a Revolving Credit Facility available to us with available borrowing capacity of 450.0 million. We are obligated to pay interest on loans under the Revolving Credit Facility as well as other customary fees, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, if any, bear interest at floating rates. As a result, we are exposed to risks related to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent it impacts our borrowings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. See Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part I, Item 2. of this Quarterly Report and Note 11 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Our material legal proceedings are described in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report in the notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of our 2023 Form 10-K, the other information in this Quarterly Report, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as our other public filings with the SEC, before deciding to invest in our Class A common stock. There have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K, other than the below. The occurrence of any of the events described therein could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects. In such an event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
 Restrictions on Shift4 s dealings with Vectron may delay the implementation of our acquisition strategy and could adversely impact our results of operations. 
 On June 14, 2024, we acquired a majority stake in Vectron. Based in Germany, Vectron is a supplier of POS systems to the restaurant and hospitality verticals, and we believe provides us with local product expertise and a European distribution network of POS resellers. Under German law, we are subject to certain restrictions in our dealings with Vectron. Until a Domination and/or Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement DPLTA is established, we will not have control over the day-to-day operations of Vectron. These restrictions could delay the implementation of our strategy and may adversely impact our results of operations. There can be no assurance that a DPLTA will be established. 
 If Shift4 enters into a DPLTA with Vectron, the Company may be subject to certain risks that could adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 We intend to enter into a DPLTA with Vectron and its minority shareholders. According to the applicable provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, under a DPLTA, we would be obligated to compensate any annual net loss of Vectron. Furthermore, each remaining minority Vectron shareholder would have the option to either: 
 Remain a Vectron shareholder and receive an adequate fixed or variable annual guaranteed dividend in the case of a domination agreement, or annual recurring compensation in the case of a profit and loss transfer agreement, as stipulated by the German Stock Corporation Act. 
 Receive adequate exit compensation in exchange for their Vectron shares, in accordance with the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act. 
 Vectron shareholders choosing the first option may later elect the second option for as long as the offer for the exit compensation remains open. Our obligation to pay an adequate fixed or variable annual guaranteed dividend or annual recurring compensation could result in a continuous payment obligation that may be higher than the dividends otherwise distributed to Vectron s shareholders.

Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs, subject to the terms of the program. Open market repurchases will be structured to occur within the pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements under the Exchange Act to facilitate repurchases of its shares of common stock under this authorization. This program does not obligate us to acquire any new particular amount of common stock. The program replaces any and all prior repurchase programs, and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at our Board s discretion.

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.17(f) , no Lender shall be required to provide any documentation that the Lender is not legally eligible to deliver. 
 (g) If the Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund (whether received in cash or applied as a credit against any cash taxes payable) of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Draw Party or with respect to which any Draw Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17 , it shall pay over such refund to any Draw Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by any Draw Party under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Lender (including any Taxes imposed with respect to such refund), and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund) provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Draw Party plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Lender in the event the Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g) , in no event will the Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (g) to the extent that the payment thereof would place the Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the position that the Lender would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section 2.17 shall not be construed to require the Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the relevant Draw Party or any other Person.
