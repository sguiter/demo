CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about BC Partners Lending Corporation (the Company, we, us, or our ), our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, outlook, potential, predicts and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies; 

such an economic downturn could disproportionately impact the companies which we intend to target for investment, potentially causing us to experience a decrease in investment opportunities and diminished demand for capital from these companies; 

such an economic downturn could also impact availability and pricing of our financing; 

geopolitical instability and volatility in the global markets caused by events such as the deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the U.S. and China, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the conflict between Israel and Hamas; 

economic and political stability in the United States and international markets; 

a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair our lending and investment activities; 

interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly if we elect to use leverage as part of our investment strategy; 

currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars; 

our future operating results; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

competition with other entities and our affiliates for investment opportunities; 

the speculative and illiquid nature of our investments; 

the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments as well as any estimates regarding potential use of leverage; 

the adequacy of our financing sources and working capital; 

the loss of key personnel; 

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; 

the ability of BC Partners Advisors L.P. (the Adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 

the ability of the Adviser to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 

actual and potential conflicts of interest with the Adviser and its affiliates; 

our ability to qualify and maintain our qualification as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and as a business development company BDC 

the effect of legal, tax and regulatory changes on us and our portfolio companies; and 

other risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 12, 2024. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this quarterly report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which apply only as of the date of this quarterly report. Moreover, we undertake no obligation to revise or to update any of the forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law or U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (the SEC rule or regulation.

of its investment company taxable income (which is generally its ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of its realized net short-term capital gains over its realized net long-term capital losses) and net tax-exempt income for that year. In order for the Company not to be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, it must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) of its ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) of its capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year, and (iii) any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which the Company paid no U.S. federal income tax. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on this income. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Company has analyzed the tax positions taken on federal and state income tax returns for all open tax years and has concluded that no provision for income tax for uncertain tax positions is required in the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company s major tax jurisdictions are U.S. federal, New York State, and foreign jurisdictions where the Company makes significant investments. The Company s federal and state income and federal excise tax returns for tax years for which the applicable statutes of limitations have not expired are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state departments of revenue. 
 of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many shareholders elect to receive cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated among the stockholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any shareholder electing to receive cash receive less than of its entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements are met for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the distribution paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. Taxable shareholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the amount of the distribution as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain distribution) to the extent of the Company s current or accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. shareholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such distributions in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. shareholder sells the stock it receives in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the distribution, depending on the market price of the Company s stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. shareholders, the Company may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such distributions, including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in common stock. The current published guidance that allows certain stock distributions of a RIC to fulfill the RIC s own distribution requirements applies only to publicly offered RICs. The Company believes that it currently does not qualify as a publicly offered RIC, although the Company may qualify as a publicly offered RIC for future years.

No person who is an officer, director or employee of the Adviser or its affiliates and who serves as a director of the Company receives any compensation from the Company for his or her services as a director. However, the Company reimburses the Administrator (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Administrator (or its affiliates) to the Company s Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the business affairs of the Company). For three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred administrative fees of million and million, respectively. For nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred administrative fees of million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 such amounts were partially offset against amounts due from the Adviser in connection with the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement (the Expense Support Agreement ), as described below. Investment Advisory Agreement On April 23, 2018, the Company entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser which was amended and restated on November 7, 2018 and further amended on July 9, 2019 (as amended, the Investment Advisory Agreement ). On November 6, 2024, the Board unanimously approved the renewal of the Investment Advisory Agreement for a period of twelve months commencing on November 7, 2024. The amendments were each approved at the time by the Company s sole stockholder. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will be responsible for managing the Company s business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing due diligence on potential investments, structuring its investments, monitoring its portfolio companies and providing managerial assistance to portfolio companies. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company will pay the Adviser a base management fee and may also pay to it certain incentive fees.

. The management fee for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately prorated and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant month or quarter. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company incurred management fees of million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred management fees of million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, such amounts were partially offset against amounts due from the Adviser in connection with the Expense Support Agreement, as described below. The incentive fee consists of two parts, as follows: (i) The first component, For purposes of determining whether pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, pre-incentive fee net investment income is expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. 

 (ii) The second component, the capital gains incentive fee, payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears, equals of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for prior periods. The Company accrues, but does not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized capital appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser if the Company were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. 

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred incentive fees of million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred incentive fees of million and million, respectively. The Investment Advisory Agreement was initially in effect for a period of two years from its effective date and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by (i) the vote of the Board, or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, and (ii) the vote of a majority of the Company s Board who are not parties to the Investment Advisory Agreement or interested persons of the Company, of the Adviser or of any of their respective affiliates, as defined in the 1940 Act. The Adviser may, from time to time, pay amounts owed by the Company to third-party providers of goods or services, including the Board, and the Company will subsequently reimburse the Adviser for such amounts paid on its behalf. Amounts payable to the Adviser are settled in the normal course of business without formal payment terms. Prior to the Company s commencement of operations, the Adviser and its affiliates have incurred operating expenses on behalf of the Company in the amount of million, including audit fees of million, legal fees of million, professional fees of thousand, directors fees of million, insurance of million and other expenses of thousand. The Company will have no responsibility for such costs until the Adviser submits such costs, or a portion thereof, for reimbursement. Co-investment Exemptive Relief As a BDC, the Company is subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making its investments. For example, BDCs generally are not permitted to co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its affiliates in the absence of an exemptive order from the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may, simultaneously co-invest in transactions where price is the only negotiated term. On April 10, 2023, superseding a prior exemptive order granted on October 23, 2018, the SEC issued an order granting an application for exemptive relief to us and certain of our affiliates to co-invest, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, in certain private placement transactions, with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates, including business development companies, registered closed-end funds, private funds, certain proprietary accounts of the Investment Adviser or its affiliates, and any future funds that are advised by the Adviser or its affiliated investment advisers. Under the terms of the exemptive order, in order for the Company to participate in a co-investment transaction a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Company s independent directors must conclude that (i) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and its stockholders and do not involve overreaching with respect of the Company or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (ii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company s stockholders and is consistent with the Company s investment objectives and strategies and certain criteria established by the Board.

of total capital commitments. Prior to the Company s commencement of operations, the Adviser funded the Company s organization and offering costs in the amount of million. The Company will have no responsibility for such costs until the Adviser submits such costs, or a portion thereof, for reimbursement, subject to a cap of of the Company s total commitments and provided further that the Adviser or its affiliates may not be reimbursed for payment of excess organization and offering expenses that were incurred more than three years prior to the proposed reimbursement. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company accrued organization and offering costs of thousand and , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company accrued organization and offering costs of and thousand, respectively . Amounts due to the Adviser for the expected recoveries of organization, offering and operating expenses incurred on behalf of the Company, and amounts due from the Adviser under the Expense Support Agreement for such amounts are reflected on a net basis in amounts due to/from affiliates on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Expense Support Agreement On August 22, 2019, the Company entered into the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser, the purpose of which was to ensure that no portion of distributions made to the Company s stockholders was paid from the Company s offering proceeds or borrowings (the Distribution Objective ). Commencing with the fourth quarter of 2019 and on a quarterly basis thereafter, the Adviser would reimburse the Company for operating expenses in an amount sufficient to meet the Distribution Objective. Any payment so required to be made by the Adviser is referred to herein as an Expense Payment. The Adviser s obligation to make an Expense Payment becomes a liability of the Adviser, and the right to such Expense Payment becomes an asset of the Company, no later than the last business day of the applicable calendar quarter. The Expense Payment for any calendar quarter shall, as promptly as possible, be: (i) paid by the Adviser to the Company in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds, and/or (ii) offset against amounts due from the Company to the Adviser. Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) the Company s net investment company taxable income (including net short-term capital gains reduced by net long-term capital losses), (ii) the Company s net capital gains (including the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses), and (iii) distributions paid to or otherwise earned by the Company on account of investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above.) Following any calendar quarter in which Available Operating Funds exceed the cumulative distributions paid to the Company s stockholders in such calendar quarter (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as Excess Operating funds ), the Company shall pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof in accordance with the stipulation below, as applicable, to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to the Company within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter have been reimbursed or waived. Any payments required to be made by the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to herein as a Reimbursement Payment. The amount of the Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter is equal to the lesser of (i) the Excess Operating Funds in such calendar quarter, and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to the Company within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter that have not been previously reimbursed by the Company to the Adviser. The Company s obligation to make a Reimbursement Payment becomes a liability to the Company, and the right to such Reimbursement Payment becomes an asset of the Adviser, no later than the last business day of the applicable calendar quarter. The Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter shall, as promptly as possible, be paid by the Company to the Adviser in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds. Any Reimbursement Payments shall be deemed to have reimbursed the Adviser for Expense Payments in chronological order beginning with the oldest Expense Payment eligible for reimbursement. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the gross Expense Reimbursement recoverable by the Adviser from the Company was and million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the gross Expense Reimbursement recovered by the Adviser from the Company was and million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, all eligible reimbursable expenses have been paid back to the Adviser and the Company no longer has any obligations under the Expense Support Agreement.

Generally, under the 1940 Act, the Company would be presumed to control a portfolio company if it owned more than 25 of its voting securities or it had the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company, and would be an affiliated person of a portfolio company if it owned 5 or more of its voting securities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not control any of its portfolio companies, each as defined in the 1940 Act.

Our Board and initial stockholder have approved our ability to utilize the increased leverage limit, which requires asset coverage of at least . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s asset coverage was and , respectively. On December 16, 2019, the Company, through BCPL Funding, entered into a debt financing facility with UBS AG, London Branch UBS ), pursuant to which up to million will be made available to the Company (the Facility ). On March 12, 2021, the Facility was amended (the Second A R Facility ), pursuant to which the amoun t made available to the Company was increased from million to million. Pursuant to the Facility, the Company sold certain loans in its portfolio to BCPL Funding (the Initial Loans ), in consideration for certain Class A Notes (the Class A Notes issued by BCPL Funding. The Initial Loans secure the obligations of BCPL Funding under the Class A Notes, issued pursuant to an indenture between BCPL Funding and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Indenture ). On March 12, 2021, in connection with the Second A R Facility, BCPL Funding entered into a Supplemental Indenture with the trustee (the Second A R Indenture ). The Second A R Indenture expands the asset eligibility criteria and allows for the issuance of additional Class A Notes. Pursuant to the Second A R Indenture, BCPL Funding issued additional Class A Notes which were purchased by the Company pursuant to a Subscription Agreement between the Company and BCPL Funding, dated as of March 12, 2021. The obligations of BCPL Funding under the additional Class A Notes are secured by the Portfolio Assets to be sold by the Company to BCPL Funding from time to time pursuant to the A R Issuer Sale and Contribution Agreement. Principal on the Class A Notes will be due and payable at maturity on December 18, 2029. The Class A Notes do not provide for interest payments.

million, in connection with the purchase by UBS of the increased funded outstanding principal amount of the Class A Notes held by the Company. Such increases in the purchase price under the Repurchase Agreement are conditioned upon the satisfaction of certain criteria with respect to the characteristics and total value of the Portfolio Assets held by BCPL Funding, and composition of the Portfolio Assets, in each case as set forth in the Second A R Indenture, among others, which criteria are customary for similar transactions. The scheduled Repurchase Date under the Fifth A R Confirmation is . The financing fee under the Facility is equal to Term SOFR plus a spread of per year for the relevant period. Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, the Company has made certain representations and warranties and is required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other requirements customary for similar transactions. In addition to customary events of default included in similar transactions, the Repurchase Agreement also contains the following events of default, among others: (a) the failure to pay the repurchase price upon the applicable payment dates; (b) the failure to make a voluntary contribution of cash to BCPL Funding if the settlement for the commitment the Company made for the voluntary contribution of Portfolio Assets under the Contribution Agreement does not occur, each within the periods as set forth in the Repurchase Agreement, caused by negative changes in the value or composition of the Portfolio Assets that result in a failure to satisfy the criteria with respect thereto set forth in the Indenture; (c) the occurrence of an act by the Company that constitutes fraud or criminal negligence in respect of its investment activity pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement; and (d) any officer or employee of the Company who has direct responsibility for the management of the Portfolio Assets is indicted for any act constituting fraud or criminal negligence in respect of investment activity and such person fails to be removed from such person s managing the Portfolio Assets within the period as set forth in the Collateral Management Agreement. The Company had provided a make-whole guarantee to the lender in the event that the pledged assets were insufficient to satisfy the repayment of the Facility.

Distributions The Company may fund its cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds available to it, including offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and expense reimbursements from the Adviser, which are subject to recoupment. The Company has not established limits on the amount of funds it may use from available sources to make distributions. During certain periods, the Company s distributions may exceed its taxable earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions the Company makes may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a stockholder s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from the Company s investment activities.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data, percentages and as otherwise indicated; for example, with the word million or otherwise) 
 
 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements set forth on page 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise indicated, the terms we, us, our, the Company and BCPL refer to BC Partners Lending Corporation. 
 Overview 
 The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland on December 22, 2017. We have elected to be treated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ), and as a regulated investment company RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we intend to qualify annually as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). As a BDC and a RIC, we are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets, source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90 of our investment company taxable income and net tax-exempt income. Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Under the relevant Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules, the term eligible portfolio company includes most private companies, whose principal place of business is the United States, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than 250 million. These rules also permit us to include as qualifying assets certain follow-on investments in companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time of initial investment but that no longer meet the definition. In addition, we will not invest more than 30 of our total assets in companies whose principal place of business is outside the United States. The Company is an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), and the Company is taking advantage of the extended transition period for complying with certain new or revised accounting standards provided for emerging growth companies in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). 
 Our investment objective is to make investments that generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation. We intend for our investments primarily to take the form of debt investments, which may include secured debt, unsecured debt, other debt and/or equity in private middle-market companies (we define middle-market companies as those with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA between 10 million and 50 million). In addition, to a lesser extent, we may invest in the securities of public companies and in structured products. While our primary focus will be on investments within the United States, we may, on occasion, invest in securities of non-U.S. entities. The first lien term loans may include traditional first lien senior secured loans or unitranche loans. Unitranche loans combine characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans as well as second lien and/or mezzanine debt Junior Debt ). Unitranche loans will expose us to the risks associated with first lien loans and Junior Debt. While there is no specific collateral associated with senior unsecured debt, such positions are senior in payment priority over subordinated debt investments. 
 Our portfolio may include covenant-lite loans which generally refer to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, covenant-lite loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower s financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in covenant-lite loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants. 
 We are managed by BC Partners Advisors L.P. (the Adviser and supervised by our board of directors (the Board ), a majority of whom are not interested persons of the Company or the Adviser as defined in the 1940 Act. On April 23, 2018, we entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement which was amended and restated on November 7, 2018 and further amended on July 9, 2019 (the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser. On November 6, 2024, the Board unanimously approved the renewal of the Investment Advisory Agreement for a period of twelve months, commencing on November 7, 2024. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Adviser a base management fee based on average gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters and an incentive fee based on our performance. We engaged BC Partners Management LLC (the Administrator to act as our administrator. On April 23, 2018, we entered into an Administration Agreement (the Administration Agreement with the Administrator. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for certain services performed to enable us to operate. 
 31 

On October 25, 2019, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Great Lakes BCPL Funding Ltd. BCPL Funding ), a Cayman Islands exempted company, which holds certain of our portfolio loan investments. On December 16, 2019, and amended on March 12, 2021, we, through BCPL Funding, entered into a debt financing facility, as amended on March 12, 2021, pursuant to which up to 75 million is available to us to fund investments and for other general corporate purposes (the Facility ). See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt below. On January 28, 2020, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, BCPL Sub Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds our equity investment. 
 Business Environment and Developments/Outlook 
 Inflation has accelerated in the U.S. and globally, resulting in a tightening of monetary policy in the United States. Inflation may continue in the near to medium-term. Certain of our portfolio companies may be impacted by inflation and elevated interest rates and persistent inflationary pressures could negatively affect our portfolio companies profit margins. Elevated interest rates may have a negative impact on us and BDCs generally. For example, high interest rates may make it more difficult for our portfolio companies to service their obligations under the debt investments that we hold, and could also cause portfolio companies to shift cash from other productive uses to the payment of interest, which may have a material adverse effect on their business and operations and could, over time, lead to increased defaults. Further, to the extent we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. As a result, high market interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our net investment income in the event we use debt to finance our investments. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could also reduce our net investment income. The year ended December 31, 2023 was characterized by continued volatility in global markets, driven by investor concerns over inflation, rising interest rates, slowing economic growth, political and regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical conditions. Recent events affecting financial institutions have also contributed to volatility in global markets and diminished liquidity and credit availability in the market broadly. Significant market dislocation, particularly in the financial sector, could limit the liquidity of certain assets traded in the credit markets, and this could impact our ability to sell such assets at attractive prices or in a timely manner. 
 Geopolitical instability also continues to pose risk. In particular, the current U.S. political environment and the resulting uncertainties regarding actual and potential shifts in U.S. foreign investment, trade, taxation, economic, environmental and other policies under the current administration, as well as the impact of geopolitical tension, such as a deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the U.S. and China or the conflicts in Eastern Europe or the Middle East, could lead to disruption, instability and volatility in the global markets. Unfavorable economic conditions would be expected to increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events may limit our investment originations, and limit our ability to grow and could have a material negative impact on our operating results, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the fair values of our debt and equity investments.
 
 We are required to carry our investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser in its role as valuation designee of the Company. Decreases in fair values of our investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation. Depending on market conditions, we could incur substantial losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We have had an increase in our net asset value per share since December 31, 2023 which is primarily the result of an increase in the mark to market of our investment portfolio driven by a recovery in our liquid portfolio during the year. 
 We are permitted under the 1940 Act, as a BDC, to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150 after such borrowing. In addition, our outstanding borrowings contain affirmative and negative covenants and events of default relating to minimum stockholders equity, minimum obligors net worth, minimum asset coverage, minimum liquidity and maintenance of RIC and BDC status, as well as cross-default provisions relating to other indebtedness. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with our asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act and we are in compliance with all of the covenants pertaining to all of our borrowings. However, any continued increase in unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio or further significant reductions in our net asset value increases the risk of breaching the relevant covenants, including those relating to minimum stockholders equity, minimum obligor net worth, and minimum asset coverage. If we fail to satisfy the respective covenants in our borrowings, or are unable to cure any event of default or obtain a waiver from the lender, it could result in foreclosure by the lenders under the credit facility, which would accelerate our repayment obligations under the facility and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Adviser approved the fair value of our investment portfolio in good faith in accordance with our valuation procedures, with input from third-party valuation firms based on information available at the time of approval. 
 Subscription Agreement 
 We are authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock at 0.001 par value per share. 
 32 

We have entered into subscription agreements (the Subscription Agreements with investors providing for the private placement of shares of our common stock. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase shares of our common stock up to the amount of their respective capital commitment on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a drawdown notice to our investors with a minimum of 10 business days prior notice. Our initial private offering closed on September 26, 2019 (the Initial Closing Date ). 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had received capital commitments totaling 73.9 million and 68.5 million, respectively.

Liquidity 
 In April 2020, the Company submitted to the SEC an application for exemptive relief intended, if granted, to provide investors with liquidity options with respect to their investments in shares of the Company s common stock. In August 2022, the SEC Staff informed the Company that it did not intend to grant the Company's application at the current time, and the Company withdrew its application. The Board continues to consider alternative means of liquidity for the Company's stockholders, including potentially listing the shares of the Company on a national securities exchange or commencing periodic repurchase or tender offers in the future (a "Liquidity Action"). 
 The Company will wind down its operations within ten years after the Initial Closing Date, unless the Board and/or stockholders determine to take a Liquidity Action. 
 Our Investment Framework 
 We are a Maryland corporation organized to invest primarily in private middle-market companies in the form of secured debt, unsecured debt, other debt and/or equity securities. Our investment objective is to make investments that generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation. We define middle-market companies as those with EBITDA between 10 million and 50 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the average investment size in each of our portfolio companies was approximately 2.5 million and 2.7 million, respectively, based on fair value. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on the direct origination and syndication of loans to middle-market companies domiciled in the United States. 
 Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital generally available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors. 
 33 

We may invest up to 30 of the investment portfolio in non-qualifying opportunistic investments, including investments in high-yield bonds, debt and equity securities of collateralized loan obligation funds, foreign investments, joint ventures, managed funds, partnerships and distressed debt or debt and equity securities of large cap public companies. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total amount of non-qualifying assets as a percentage of total assets was approximately 1.1 and 4.2 , respectively. 
 Revenues 
 The principal measure of our financial performance is net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income or loss, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on foreign currency, net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments, and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on foreign currency. Net investment income or loss is the difference between our income from interest, distributions, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost, including the respective realized gain or loss on foreign currency for any non-U.S. dollar denominated investment transactions. Net realized gain or loss on foreign currency is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio, including the respective unrealized appreciation or depreciation on foreign currency for any non-U.S. dollar denominated investments. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on foreign currency is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 
 We principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to ten years, and bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), or an alternate base rate, such as the Prime Rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semi-annually. In addition, some of our investments may provide for PIK interest. Such amounts of accrued PIK interest are added to the cost of the investment on the respective capitalization dates and generally become due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. To a lesser extent, we may also generate revenues in the form of distributions and other distributions on the equity or other securities we anticipate holding. In addition, we may generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees. Any such fees generated in connection with our investments will be recognized when earned. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees, if any, and other expenses under the Investment Advisory Agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements, and other expenses necessary for our operations. The management and incentive fees will compensate the Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. On August 20, 2019, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the Letter Agreement with the Adviser pursuant to which, for the period ending December 31, 2019, the Adviser waived 50 of the base management fee to be paid by the Company under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The waiver was prorated for any partial month or quarter. Management fees waived are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. 
 We reimburse the Administrator for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including the Adviser s portion of the compensation and related expenses for certain personnel who provide administrative services. Such services include, among other things, clerical, bookkeeping and recordkeeping services, investor relations, performing or overseeing the performance of our corporate operations (which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC), assisting us in calculating the net asset value per share, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. 
 We will also bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including but not limited to: 
 the cost of our organization and the offering, subject to a cap of 1.50 of the Company s total capital commitments, and further bound by a time limitation; 

the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 

the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of our common stock and other securities; 

fees and expenses payable under any dealer manager or placement agent agreements, if any; 

administration fees payable under the Administration Agreement and any sub-administration agreements, including related expenses; 

debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; 

costs of hedging; 

expenses, including travel expense, incurred by the Adviser, or members of the investment team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; 

transfer agent and custodial fees; 

34 

fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 

federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies; 

federal, state and local taxes; 

independent directors fees and expenses including certain travel expenses; 

costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration and listing fees, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing; 

the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholder or director meetings and the compensation of personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; 

commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; 

research and market data; 

fidelity bond, directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; 

direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; 

fees and expenses associated with independent audits, outside legal and consulting costs; 

costs of winding up our affairs; 

costs incurred by either the Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under the Administration Agreement; 

extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification); and 

costs associated with reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws. 

We are obligated to reimburse the Adviser for expense payments made by the Adviser to us in connection with the Expense Support Agreement following any calendar quarter in which we have available operating funds. The amount of the reimbursement payment for any calendar quarter will be equal to the lesser of (i) the excess operating funds in such calendar quarter, and (ii) the aggregate amount of all expense payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter that have not been previously reimbursed by us to the Adviser. 
 In addition, we and our Administrator have contracted with U.S. Bank N.A. to provide custodial and various accounting and administrative services, including but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by the Adviser, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing in respect to RIC compliance. 
 We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms during periods of asset growth, but will decline as a percentage of total assets during such periods. 
 Leverage 
 The amount of leverage we intend to use in any period depends on a number of factors, including cash on-hand available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions. Prior to the Small Business Credit Availability Act being signed into law, a BDC generally was not permitted to incur indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing it has an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least 200 . The Small Business Credit Availability Act, signed into law on March 23, 2018, contains a provision that grants a BDC the option, subject to certain conditions and disclosure obligations, to reduce the asset coverage requirement to 150 . Our Board and initial stockholder have approved the decreased asset coverage ratio.

Investment Income 
 We generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we own, distribution income on any common or preferred stock that we own, and fees generated from the structuring of new deals. Our investments in debt securities will typically have loan maturities of three to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio, based on fair value, consisted of 96.6 first-lien debt investments and 3.4 other investments. As of December 31, 2023, our portfolio, based on fair value, consisted of 94.3 first-lien debt investments and 5.7 other investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had investments in 53 portfolio companies, with an average investment size of approximately 2.5 million based on fair value. As of December 31, 2023, we had investments in 49 portfolio companies, with an average investment size of approximately 2.7 million based on fair value. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the largest single investment in a single portfolio company based on fair value represented 4.2 and 4.4 , respectively, of our total investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 92.5 and 94.0 , respectively, of the debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio were at floating rate.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have generated interest income of 4.3 million and 4.2 million respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have generated interest income of 13.2 million and 11.4 million, respectively. Such revenues represent cash interest earned as well as non-cash portions relating to accretion of discounts. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized. 
 The level of interest income we receive is generally related to the principal balance of income-producing investments, multiplied by the contractual interest rates of our investments. Fee income is transaction based, and typically consists of amendment and consent fees, prepayment fees, structuring fees and other non-recurring fees. As such, fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees. Any such fees generated will be recognized as earned. We expect the dollar amount of interest and any distribution income that we earn to increase as the size of our investment portfolio increases.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are generated from the net proceeds of capital drawdowns of our private placement offerings of shares of our common stock, as well as from proceeds from principal repayments, income earned on investments and cash equivalents, and borrowings from the Facility. We intend to continue to generate cash primarily from future offerings of shares of our common stock, future borrowings and cash flows from operations. We may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities or increase the size of existing facilities to borrow funds to make investments, including before we have fully invested the net proceeds from our private placement offering, to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our Board determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock if immediately after the borrowing or issuance our ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150 . As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio was 199.0 . We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity including our financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150 asset coverage limitation under the 1940 Act and the asset coverage limitation under our credit facility to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund. 
 The primary uses of cash, including the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of our common stock, are for investments in portfolio companies, repayment of indebtedness, if any, cash distributions to our stockholders, and the cost of operations. Since our inception, the Adviser and its affiliates have incurred organization and offering costs on our behalf in the amount of 1.4 million. All organization and offering costs, and operating expenses prior to our commencement of operations were funded by the Adviser and we will not have responsibility for such costs until the Adviser submits such costs or a portion thereof for reimbursement, subject to a cap of 1.50 of our total capital commitments for organization and offering costs and provided further that the Adviser or its affiliates may not be reimbursed for payment of excess organization and offering expenses that were incurred more than three years prior to the proposed reimbursement. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company accrued organization and offering costs of 0 and 30 thousand, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 we had 12.1 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand, plus 37.0 million available to us under our borrowing facility, which is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the foreseeable future. In the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need additional liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions. 
 Equity 
 We are authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock at 0.001 par value per share. As of September 30, 2024, we had 3,349,201 shares outstanding. 
 39 

As of September 30, 2024 we had received capital commitments totaling 73.9 million. On October 2, 2019, pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, we delivered our first capital drawdown notice to investors relating to the issuance of 842,554 common stock for an aggregate offering price of 21.1 million, of which 10.8 million is from the Adviser and its affiliates, executives and employees of the Adviser, and directors of the Company.

Distributions and Distribution Reinvestment 
 We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute on an annual basis at least 90 of our investment company taxable income (i.e. ordinary income plus realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses) and net tax-exempt income out of the assets legally available for distribution. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we currently intend to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of our ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment. 
 We maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions. 
 We may distribute taxable distributions that are payable in cash or shares of our common stock at the election of each stockholder. In accordance with certain applicable U.S. Treasury regulations and published guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service a publicly offered RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling the RIC distribution requirements if each shareholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash available to be distributed to all shareholders must be at least 20.0 of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many shareholders elect to receive cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated among the stockholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any shareholder electing to receive cash receive less than 20.0 of its entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the distribution paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. Taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the amount of the distributions as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain distribution) to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such distributions in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the distribution, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such distributions, including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in common stock. The current published guidance that allows certain stock distributions of a RIC to fulfill the RIC's own distribution requirements applies only to publicly offered RIC's. We believe that we currently do not qualify as a publicly offered RIC, although we may qualify as a publicly offered RIC for future years. 
 40 

We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions and distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions and distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions and distributions or distributions and distributions at a particular level. 
 With respect to the distributions paid to stockholders, income from origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies was treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to stockholders. 
 We declared our first distribution on December 19, 2019. Subject to the Board s discretion and applicable legal restrictions, our Board intends to continue to authorize and declare a quarterly distribution amount per share of our common stock. On August 22, 2019, we entered into an Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser to ensure that no portion of distributions made to our stockholders will be paid from our offering proceeds or borrowings. 
 As described above, we may be prohibited by the 1940 Act from making distributions on our common stock if, at the time of declaration, our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is below 150 (subject to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC or no-action relief granted by the SEC to another BDC (or to us if we determine to seek such similar no-action or other relief) permitting the BDC to declare any cash distribution notwithstanding the prohibition contained in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act in order to maintain its status as a RIC under the Code). In any such event, we would be prohibited from making distributions required in order to maintain our status as a RIC unless made in accordance with any such exemptive or no-action relief granted by the SEC.

With respect to distributions, we have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan DRP for common stockholders. As a result, in the event of a declared distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of the DRP will have their distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.

Related-Party Transactions 
 We have entered into certain contracts under which we have future commitments with affiliated or related parties. We entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser to provide us with investment advisory services under which we will pay our Adviser an annual base management fee based on our average gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, and an incentive fee based on our performance. We also entered into an administrative agreement with the Administrator to perform (or oversee, or arrange for, the performance of) the administrative services necessary to enable us to operate and under which we will reimburse the Administrator for administrative expenses incurred on our behalf. See Note 3. Related Party Transactions Administration Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement for a description of our obligations under these agreements. We also entered into an Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser, the purpose of which is to ensure that no portion of distributions made to our stockholders will be paid from our offering proceeds or borrowings. We are obligated to reimburse the Adviser for expense payments made by the Adviser to us in connection with the Expense Support Agreement following any calendar quarter in which we have available operating funds. The amount of the reimbursement payment for any calendar quarter will be equal to the lesser of (i) the excess operating funds in such calendar quarter, and (ii) the aggregate amount of all expense payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter that have not been previously reimbursed by us to the Adviser.

 Recent Developments 
 On November 6, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly distribution of 0.60 per share payable on December 5, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 22, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. For further discussion of our Significant Accounting Policies, see "Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies." 
 Investments at Fair Value 
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses on investments are calculated using the specific identification method as the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are recognized. 
 Investments for which market quotations are available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. 
 Debt that is not publicly traded but for which there are external pricing sources available as of the valuation date is valued using independent broker-dealer, market maker quotations or independent pricing services. The valuation committee comprised of members of the Adviser, (the "Valuation Committee") subjects these quotes to various criteria including, but not limited to, the number and quality of quotes, the deviation among the quotes and information derived from analyzing the Company's transactions in such investments throughout the reporting period. Generally, such investments are categorized in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, unless the Valuation Committee determines that the quality, quantity or deviation among quotes warrants significant adjustment to the inputs utilized. 
 The Board has designated the Adviser as its valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, and in that role the Adviser is responsible for performing fair value determinations relating to all of the Company s investments, including periodically assessing and managing any material valuation risks and establishing and applying fair value methodologies, in accordance with valuation policies and procedures that have been approved by the Board. The Board remains ultimately responsible for fair value determinations under the 1940 Act and satisfies its responsibility through oversight of the valuation designee in accordance with Rule 2a-5. 
 Investments that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is expected to be the case for substantially all of the Company s investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, based on, among other things, input of independent third-party valuation firm(s). 
 The Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following: 
 The Company s quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued using certain inputs, among other, provided by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the Company s portfolio management team. The Company utilizes an independent valuation firm to provide valuation on each material illiquid security at least once every trailing 12-month period; 

Preliminary valuations are reviewed and discussed with management of the Adviser and investment professionals; and 

The Adviser will review the valuations and determine the fair value of each investment. Valuations that are not based on readily available market quotations will be valued in good faith based on, among other things, where applicable, third parties. 

43 

As part of the valuation process, the Adviser may consider other information and may use valuation methods including but not limited to (i) market quotes for similar investments, (ii) recent trading activity, (iii) discounting forecasted cash flows of the investment, (iv) models that consider the implied yields from comparable debt, (v) third party appraisal, (vi) sale negotiations and purchase offers received from independent parties and (vii) estimated value of underlying assets to be received in liquidation or restructuring. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein. 
 Under existing accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. This accounting guidance emphasizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. 
 The Company classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy as defined by current accounting guidance 
 Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible to the Company. 
 Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices. 
 Level 3: Significant inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability. 
 A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Investments for which no external pricing sources are available as of the valuation date are included in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will not accrue PIK interest if management determines that the PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount, and market discount are capitalized and then we amortize such amounts as interest income. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We further record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts. 
 Income Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. To qualify for and maintain qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements, and make minimum distributions to stockholders. We may be subject to a 4 nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on undistributed income. See Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies Income Taxes. 
 The tax years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 remain subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities. No material interest expense or penalties have been assessed for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. If the Company was required to recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits this would be recognized as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 The Company s subsidiary, BCPL Sub Holdings LLC records deferred tax assets or liabilities related to temporary book versus tax differences on the income or loss generated by the underlying equity investments held. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a net deferred tax liability of 0.2 million and zero, respectively.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, interest rate risk, and currency risk. Changes in interest rate may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments and cash and cash equivalents. Generally, a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to any variable rate investments we may hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we may hold. However, for those variable rate investments we may hold that provide for an interest rate floor, our interest income will not decrease below a threshold amount. To the extent that a substantial portion of our investments may be in variable rate investments, an increase in interest rates beyond this threshold would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the hurdle rate applicable to the upper level breakpoint of the pre-incentive fee net investment income incentive fee, and may result in a substantial increase in our net investment income and to the amount of incentive fees payable to the Adviser with respect to our increased pre-incentive fee net investment income. Conversely, a decline in the general level of interest rates, including the current environment, can be expected to lead to lower interest rates applicable to any variable rate investments we may hold and to increases in the value of any fixed rate investments we may hold. Such a decrease would make it more difficult for us to meet or exceed the hurdle rate applicable to the upper level breakpoint of the pre-incentive fee net investment income incentive fee, and may result in a substantial decrease in our net investment income and to the amount of incentive fees payable to the Adviser with respect to our decreased pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
 In addition, we borrow funds in order to make additional investments. Our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. As a result, we will be subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates when we or any future subsidiaries have debt outstanding or financing arrangements in effect, our interest expense will increase, which could reduce our net investment income, especially to the extent we hold fixed rate investments. 
 We expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and debt. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We invest primarily in illiquid debt of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser based on, among other things, input of independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged by the Adviser, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single technique for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If, in the future, we are required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments do not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser as valuation designee, subject to the oversight of the Board in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 92.5 of the debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio were at floating rates indexed to SOFR or Prime, as was our outstanding debt. As of September 30, 2024, none of our variable rate securities were yielding interest at a rate equal to the established interest rate floor. 
 The following table shows the estimated annualized impact on net investment income based on hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates on our loan portfolio and outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024, assuming there are no changes in our investment and borrowing structure.

Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments that could affect our net income. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above. 
 Currency Risk 
 From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency. These investments are translated into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. We may seek to utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had no assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the 1934 Act, we evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level that we would meet our disclosure obligations. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the 1934 Act) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
