 the guidance on , and its adoption did t have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ("ASU 2023-07"). This change is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses, allowing financial statement users to better understand the components of a segment's profit or loss and assess potential future cash flows for each reportable segment and the entity as a whole. The amendments expand a public entity's segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, clarifying when an entity may report one or more additional measures to assess segment performance, requiring enhanced interim disclosures and providing new disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, among other new disclosure requirements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. Although the ASU only requires additional disclosure about the Company's operating segment, the Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance with respect to the consolidated financial statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 "Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.

 components a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and incentive fee are ultimately borne by the Company s stockholders. Base Management Fee The base management fee is payable on the first day of each calendar quarter and is calculated on the Company's "Gross Assets" which, for purposes of the Advisory Agreement, is defined as the Company s gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage, as well as any PIK interest, as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. The base management fee will be an amount equal to annualized) of the Company s average daily Gross Assets during the most recently completed calendar quarter, so long as the aggregate amount of the Company s Gross Assets as of the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter is equal to or greater than billion. If the aggregate amount of the Company s Gross Assets as of the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter is less than billion but equal to or greater than million, the base management fee will be an amount equal to annualized) of the Company s average daily Gross Assets during the most recently completed calendar quarter. If the aggregate amount of the Company s Gross Assets as of the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter is less than million, the base management fee will be an amount equal to annualized) of the Company s average daily Gross Assets during the most recently completed calendar quarter. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, RGC earned base management fees at a rate of per annum, amounting to million and million , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, RGC earned base management fees at a rate of per annum, amounting to million and million , respectively. Incentive Fee The incentive fee, which provides RGC with a share of the income that RGC generates for the Company, consists of an investment-income component and a capital-gains component, which are largely independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. Under the investment-income component (the Income Incentive Fee ), the Company pays RGC each quarter an incentive fee with respect to the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income ("Pre-Incentive Fee NII"). The Income Incentive Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Pre-Incentive Fee NII for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. Payments based on Pre-Incentive Fee NII will be based on the Pre-Incentive Fee NII earned for the quarter. For this purpose, Pre-Incentive Fee NII means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence, managerial and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued by the Company during the fiscal quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the amended and restated administration agreement with the Administrator, and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee NII includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID and ETP accretion, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income the Company has not yet received in cash; provided, however, that the portion of the Income Incentive Fee attributable to deferred interest features will be paid, only if and to the extent received in cash, and any accrual thereof will be reversed if and to the extent such interest is reversed in connection with any write off or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to any deferred interest accrual, applied in each case in the order such interest was accrued. Such subsequent payments in respect of previously accrued income will not reduce the amounts payable for any quarter pursuant to the calculation of the Income Incentive Fee described above. Pre-Incentive Fee NII does not include any realized or unrealized capital gains (losses).

Until the consummation of a Spin-Off transaction (defined below), in the event that (a) the sum of the Company s cumulative net realized losses since the date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC exceeded of the total non-control/non-affiliate investments made by the Company since the date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC through the end of the quarter and (b) the Pre-Incentive Fee NII adjusted to include any realized capital gains and losses Adjusted Pre-Incentive Fee NII ), expressed as an annualized rate of return on the value of the Company s average daily net assets (defined as total assets less liabilities), since the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC through the end of the quarter was less than , no Income Incentive Fee would be payable for such quarter until the first subsequent quarter in which either (x) the sum of the Company s cumulative net realized losses since the date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC was equal to or less than of the total non-control/non-affiliate investments made by the Company since the date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC through the end of such subsequent quarter or (y) the Adjusted Pre-Incentive Fee NII, expressed as an annualized rate of return on the value of the Company s average daily net assets (defined as total assets less liabilities), since the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC through the of the end of the quarter equals or exceeds ; provided, however, that in no event would any Income Incentive Fee be payable for any prior quarter after the three-year anniversary of the end of such quarter. For purposes of the Advisory Agreement, a Spin-Off transaction includes either a transaction whereby (a) the Company offers its stockholders the option to elect to either (i) retain their ownership of shares of the Company s common stock, or (ii) exchange their shares of the Company s common stock for shares of common stock in a newly formed entity (the Public Fund that will elect to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code (the Public Fund Spin Off or (b) the Company completes a listing of the Company s securities on any securities exchange (an Exchange Listing ). Under the capital gains component of the incentive fee (the Capital Gains Fee ), the Company will pay RGC, as of the end of each calendar year, of the Company s aggregate cumulative realized capital gains, if any, from the date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC through the end of that calendar year, computed net of the Company s aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital losses through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Fee. For the foregoing purpose, the Company s aggregate cumulative realized capital gains will not include any unrealized gains. If such amount is negative, then Capital Gains Fee will be payable for such year. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, RGC earned incentive fees of million and million , respectively; million and million of which were payable in cash, respectively, and million and million were accrued and generated from deferred interest, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, RGC earned incentive fees of million and million , respectively; of which million and million were payable in cash, respectively, and million and million were accrued and generated from deferred interest, respectively. All incentive fees accrued and generated from deferred interest (i.e., PIK and certain ETP accretion) are not payable until receipt of associated cash by the Company, at which time the incentive fees are recategorized from deferred incentive fees payable to cash incentive fees payable. All figures presented for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are net of such recategorizations during the respective period. As of September 30, 2024, million were payable in cash, and million were deferred incentive fees payable, both of which are included in Incentive fees payable on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, million of incentive fees payable were payable in cash, and million were deferred incentive fees payable, both of which are included in Incentive fees payable on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The capital gains incentive fee consists of fees related to realized gains and losses and unrealized capital losses. With respect to the incentive fee expense accrual related to the capital gains incentive fee, U.S. GAAP requires that the capital gains incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized gains in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized gains were realized even though such unrealized gains are not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Advisory Agreement. As of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there was capital gains incentive fee accrued, earned or payable to RGC under the Advisory Agreement.

(1) The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s debt securities are origination yields and discount rates. The origination yield is defined as the initial market price of an investment in a hypothetical market to hypothetical market participants where buyers and sellers are willing participants. The discount rate is related to company-specific characteristics such as underlying investment performance, projected cash flows, and other characteristics of the investment. Significant increases or decreases in the inputs in isolation may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement, depending on the materiality of the investment. However, a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement of any of the Company s portfolio investments may occur regardless of whether there is a significant increase or decrease in the unobservable inputs. 

 (2) The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s warrant and equity-related securities are inputs used in the OPM, which include industry volatility, risk free interest rate and estimated time to exit. The Equity Allocation model and the Black Scholes model were the main OPMs used during the period ended September 30, 2024. Probability Weighted Expected Return Models PWERM and other techniques were used as determined appropriate. Significant increases (decreases) in the inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement, depending on the materiality of the investment. However, a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement of any of the Company s portfolio investments may occur regardless of whether there is a significant increase (decrease) in the unobservable inputs. For some investments, additional consideration may be given to data from the last round of financing or merger/acquisition events near the measurement date. 

 (3) Warrant investments using a PWERM valuation technique contain success fees, in which case the inputs are not applicable because the nature of a success fee is a fixed payout dependent on certain liquidation events.

 of its net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of its net long-term capital losses, if any, to its stockholders. So long as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its stockholders as dividends. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned by the Company represents obligations of the Company s investors and will not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The Company intends to make sufficient distributions to maintain its RIC status each year and it does not anticipate paying any material United States federal income taxes in the future. Federal income tax regulations differ from U.S. GAAP, therefore distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary in nature. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the consolidated financial statements to reflect their appropriate tax character. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.

The Company accounts for income taxes in conformity with ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes ("ASC 740"). ASC 740 provides guidelines for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet a "more-likely-than-not" threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were material uncertain income tax positions at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Although the Company files federal and state tax returns, the Company's major tax jurisdiction is federal. The previous three tax year-ends and the interim tax period since then remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. If the Company does not distribute (or is not deemed to have distributed) each calendar year the sum of (1) of its net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) of its capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years (the Minimum Distribution Amount ), the Company will generally be required to pay a U.S. federal excise tax equal to of the amount by which the Minimum Distribution Amount exceeds the distributions for the year. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income, the Company accrues excise taxes, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned using an annual effective excise tax rate. The annual effective U.S. federal excise tax rate is determined by dividing the estimated annual excise tax by the estimated annual taxable income. If the Company does not qualify to be treated as a RIC for any taxable year, the Company will be taxed as a regular corporation (a C corporation under subchapter C of the Code for such taxable year. If the Company has previously qualified as a RIC but is subsequently unable to qualify, and certain amelioration provisions are not applicable, the Company would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of its taxable income (including its net capital gains) at regular corporate rates. The Company would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would it be required to make distributions. In order to requalify as a RIC, in addition to the other requirements discussed above, the Company would be required to distribute all of its previously undistributed earnings attributable to the period it failed to qualify by the end of the first year that it intends to requalify. If the Company fails to requalify for a period greater than two taxable years, it may be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate tax rates on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (i.e., the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the Company had been liquidated) that it elects to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five years.

 The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10 Q. 
 Overview 
 Runway Growth Finance Corp. ("we," "us," "our," or the "Company"), a Maryland corporation formed on August 31, 2015, is structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company. On August 18, 2021, we changed our name to "Runway Growth Finance Corp." from "Runway Growth Credit Fund Inc." We are a specialty finance company focused on providing senior secured loans to high growth-potential companies in technology, healthcare, business services, financial services, select consumer services and products and other high-growth industries. Our goal is to create significant value for our stockholders and the entrepreneurs we support by providing high growth-potential companies with hybrid debt and equity financing that is more flexible than traditional credit and less dilutive than equity. Our investment objective is to maximize our total return to our stockholders primarily through current income on our loan portfolio, and secondarily through capital gains on our warrants and other equity positions. Our offices are in Chicago, Illinois; Menlo Park, California; and New York, New York. 
 We have elected to be regulated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "1940 Act"). We have also elected to be treated as aregulated investment company ("RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). While we currently qualify and intend to qualify annually to be treated as a RIC, no assurance can be provided that we will be able to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC. If we fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC for any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on any net taxable income for such year. As a BDC and a RIC, we are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets, source-of-income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90 of our investment company taxable income and net tax-exempt interest. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). We will remain an emerging growth company until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO, which closed on October 25, 2021 or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of 1.235 billion or more, (ii) December 31 of the fiscal year in which we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Exchange Act ), (which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million, measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months), or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, we will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.

 We are externally managed by Runway Growth Capital LLC ("RGC"), an investment adviser that has registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Runway Administrator Services LLC (the "Administrator"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RGC, provides all the administrative services necessary for us to operate. 
 On August 10, 2020, we, RGC, and certain other funds and accounts sponsored or managed by RGC and/or its affiliates were granted an order (the Order ), as amended on August 30, 2022, that permits us greater flexibility than the 1940 Act permits to negotiate the terms of co-investments if our Board of Directors determines that it would be advantageous for us to co-invest with other accounts sponsored or managed by RGC or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. We believe that the ability to co-invest with similar investment structures and accounts sponsored or managed by RGC or its affiliates provides additional investment opportunities and the ability to achieve greater diversification. Under the terms of the Order, a majority of our independent directors are required to make certain determinations in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment strategies and policies.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our debt investment portfolio had a dollar-weighted annualized yield of 15.9 and 15.5 , respectively . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , our debt investment portfolio had a dollar-weighted annualized yield of 18.3 and 16.0 , respectively . We calculate the yield on dollar-weighted debt investments for any period measured as (1) total related investment income during the period divided by (2) the daily average of the fair value of debt investments outstanding during the period, including any debt investments on non-accrual status. As of September 30, 2024, our debt investments had a dollar-weighted average term of 58 months at origination and a dollar-weighted average remaining term of 33 months, or approximately 2.8 years. As of September 30, 2024, substantially all of our debt investments had a committed principal amount of between 6.0 million and 85.0 million and pay cash interest at annual interest rates of between 8.0 and 14.8 .

(1) We calculate the dollar-weighted annualized yield on average investment type for any period as (a) total related investment income during the period divided by (b) the daily average of the fair value of the investment type outstanding during the period, including any investments on non-accrual status. The dollar-weighted annualized yield represents the portfolio yield and will be higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by investors. 

(2) We calculate the dollar-weighted annualized yield on average investment type for any period as (a) total related investment income during the period divided by (b) the daily average of the investment type outstanding during the period, at amortized cost, including any investments on non-accrual status. The dollar-weighted annualized yield represents the portfolio yield and will be higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by investors. 

Investment Activity 
 The value of our investment portfolio will change over time due to changes in the fair value of our underlying investments, as well as changes in the composition of our portfolio resulting from purchases of new and follow-on investments as well as repayments and sales of existing investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we funded 151.4 million in five new portfolio companies, 5.6 million in one joint venture, and 17.0 million in four existing portfolio companies, net of upfront loan origination fees and refinances. We also received 144.7 million in sales and prepayments from five portfolio companies and 2.4 million in scheduled principal repayments from one portfolio company. There was 0.1 million in proceeds from the termination of warrants, sale of preferred stock, sale of equity interest, or sale of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we funded 19.8 million in one new portfolio company, and 85.7 million in 11 existing portfolio companies, net of upfront loan origination fees and refinances. We also received 225.7 million in loan sales and prepayments from 10 portfolio companies and 7.0 million in scheduled principal payments from two portfolio companies. There were no proceeds from the termination of warrants, sale of preferred stock, sale of equity interest, or sale of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Asset Quality 
 In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, RGC uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the quality of our debt investment portfolio. Equity securities and U.S. Treasury Bills are not graded. This debt investment rating system uses a five-level numeric scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 

Investment Rating 
 
 Rating Definition 

1 
 
 Performing above plan and/or strong enterprise profile, value, financial performance/coverage. Maintaining full covenant and payment compliance as agreed. 

2 
 
 Performing at or reasonably close to plan. Acceptable business prospects, enterprise value, financial coverage. Maintaining key covenant and payment compliance as agreed. Generally, all new loans are initially graded Category 2. 

3 
 
 Performing below plan of record. Potential elements of concern over performance, trends and business outlook. Loan-to-value remains adequate. Potential key covenant non-compliance. Full payment compliance. 

4 
 
 Performing materially below plan. Non-compliant with material financial covenants. Payment default/deferral could result without corrective action. Requires close monitoring. Business prospects, enterprise value and collateral coverage declining. These investments may be in workout, and there is a possibility of loss of return but no loss of principal is expected. 

5 
 
 Going concern nature in question. Substantial decline in enterprise value and all coverages. Covenant and payment default imminent if not currently present. Investments are nearly always in workout. May experience partial and/or full loss. 

The following table shows the investment ratings of our debt investments at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

Non-Accrual Investments 
 Generally, when interest and/or principal payments on a loan become past due, or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and will cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. As of September 30, 2024, we had two senior secured term loans on non-accrual status; one loan to Mingle Healthcare Solutions, Inc. with a cost basis of 5.0 million and a fair value of 2.6 million, and one loan to Snagajob, Inc., with a cost basis of 42.7 million and a fair value of 37.3 million which represent 3.7 our total investment portfolio. From being placed on non-accrual status through September 30, 2024, cumulative interest of 0.5 million would be receivable from Mingle Healthcare Solutions, Inc. and not recorded in "Interest income" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. From being placed on non-accrual status through September 30, 2024, cumulative interest of 3.4 million would be receivable from Snagajob, Inc. and 0.2 million OID would be accreted into the cost basis, for a total of 3.6 million not recorded in "Interest income" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2023, we had no loans on non-accrual status. As of September 30, 2024, we had reversed interest income of 0.3 million related to the senior secured term loans on non-accrual status. As of December 31, 2023, we had not reversed any accrued and uncollected interest income related to the senior secured term loans on non-accrual status.

 Results of Operations 
 An important measure of our financial performance is "Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which includes "Net investment income (loss)", "Net realized gain (loss) on investments" and "Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments". "Net investment income (loss)" is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other income and our operating expenses, including interest on borrowed funds. "Net realized gain (loss) on investments" is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and U.S. Treasury Bills and their amortized cost. "Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments" is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio.

Table of Contents 

 Investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 36.7 million and 43.8 million, respectively, and includes non-recurring income of 2.0 million and 5.6 million, respectively. Non-recurring income includes, but is not limited to, acceleration of unaccreted OID, prepayment fees and amendment fees. The decrease in investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to falling interest rates and decrease in the average outstanding principal on interest-earning debt investments as a result of loan repayments and our loans to Snagajob, Inc. and Mingle Healthcare Solutions, Inc. moving to non-accrual status. 
 Investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 110.9 million and 125.0 million, respectively, and includes non-recurring income of 6.2 million and 9.0 million, respectively. The decrease in investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to falling interest rates and decrease in the average outstanding principal on interest-earning debt investments as a result of loan repayments and our loans to Snagajob, Inc., and Mingle Healthcare Solutions, Inc. moving to non-accrual status.

Table of Contents 

 Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments 
 Net change in unrealized gain on investments of 9.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in the fair value of our senior secured loans to Gynesonics, Inc. and Snagajob.com, Inc., our preferred stock investments in Gynesonics, Inc., and CareCloud, Inc., offset by decreases in fair value of our senior secured loans to Vesta Payment Solutions, Inc., VTX Intermediate Holdings, Inc., 3PL Central LLC, and Blueshift Labs, Inc., as well as a release of prior unrealized gain on the senior secured loan to CloudPay, Inc. The net change in unrealized loss on investments of 7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of our preferred stock investment in CareCloud, Inc. and our senior secured loans to Snagajob.com, Inc. and Fiscal Note, Inc., as well as a release of prior unrealized gain on the senior secured loans to Allurion Technologies, Inc. 
 Net change in unrealized loss on investments of 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of our senior secured loans to Snagajob.com, Inc.,Vesta Payment Solutions, Inc., VTX Intermediate Holdings, Inc., Blueshift Labs, Inc., FiscalNote, Inc., 3PL Central LLC, and our common stock investment and warrants in Coginiti Corp. The decrease in fair value was partially offset by an increase in fair value of our senior secured loans to Gynesonics, Inc. and our preferred stock investments in Gynesonics, Inc. and CareCloud, Inc. The net change in unrealized loss on investments of 9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to decreases in the fair value of our preferred stock investment in Gynesonics, Inc. and senior secured loans to Gynesonics, Inc. and Snagajob.com, Inc. 
 Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 
 We had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 25.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 14.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 45.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 49.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Obligations 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are derived from net proceeds from the offering of our securities, debt borrowings and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt and the proceeds from the turnover of our portfolio and from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. We expect that we may also generate cash from any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future and any future offerings of our equity or debt securities. Financing arrangements may come in the form of borrowings from banks or issuances of senior securities, which may be secured or unsecured, through registered offerings or private placements. Our primary use of funds is to make investments in eligible portfolio companies, pay our operating expenses and make distributions to holders of our common stock. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we principally funded our operations from (i) cash receipts from interest, dividend, and fee income from our investment portfolio and (ii) cash proceeds from the realization of portfolio investments through the repayments of debt investments and the sale of debt and equity investments. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating activities provided 55.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to 174.1 million provided during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 118.2 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a 33.5 million increase in purchases of investments and U.S. Treasury Bills and a 78.6 million decrease in sales and repayments of investments and U.S. Treasury Bills. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our financing activities used 55.2 million of cash, compared to 164.9 million used by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 109.7 million decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to decreased net borrowing activity of 139.0 million, partially offset by increased share repurchases of 30.2 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our net assets totaled 507.4 million, with a net asset value per share of 13.39. We intend to continue to operate in order to generate cash flows from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies. Our primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and cash distributions to holders of our common stock.

 Available Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 251.6 million in available liquidity, including 3.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, and approximately 248.0 million available under our Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base capacity. As of September 30, 2024, we had 302.0 million of secured debt outstanding under our Credit Facility, which are floating interest rate obligations and 247.3 million of unsecured debt outstanding under the 2026 and 2027 Notes, which are all fixed interest rate debt obligations. Refer to "Note 7 Borrowings" to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional discussion of our debt obligations. 
 
 Pursuant to the 1940 Act, we are permitted to incur borrowings, issue debt securities, or issue preferred stock if, immediately after the borrowings or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock is at least 150 (at least 200 prior to June 17, 2022). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was 192 and 205 , respectively. 
 As detailed above, our diverse and well-structured balance sheet is designed to provide a long-term focused and sustainable investment platform. Currently, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to support our near-term capital requirements. 
 Commitments and Obligations 
 Our significant contractual payment obligations relate to our borrowings and deferred incentive fees. As of September 30, 2024, we had 549.3 million in debt outstanding, none of which was due within the next year, 497.5 million within 1 to 3 years, and 51.8 million beyond 3 years. As of September 30, 2024, we had 11.8 million of deferred incentive fees, 1.7 million of which was due within the next year, 7.6 million within 1 to 3 years, and 2.6 million beyond 3 years. 
 In addition to our on-balance sheet contractual obligations, in the normal course of business, we have future cash requirements related to our financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These consist of unfunded commitments to extend credit, in the form of loans, to our portfolio companies. Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our balance sheet. 
 Our unfunded commitments may be significant from time to time. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 260.4 million in unfunded commitments which was comprised of 231.0 million to provide debt financing to our portfolio companies and 29.4 million in unfunded commitments to provide equity financing to the Runway-Cadma I LLC. Unfunded contractual commitments depend upon a portfolio company reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment is available to the portfolio company, which is expected to affect our funding levels. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as the on-balance sheet financial instruments that we hold. From time to time, unfunded contractual commitments may expire without being drawn and thus do not represent future cash requirements. We maintain sufficient liquidity (through cash on hand and available borrowings under the Credit Facility) to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 67.3 million of available unfunded commitments to portfolio companies that are eligible to be drawn based on achieved milestones and 29.4 million in unfunded capital commitments to Runway-Cadma I LLC. Refer to Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a summary of unfunded commitments by portfolio company as of September 30, 2024. 
 The fair value of our unfunded commitments is considered to be immaterial as the yield determined at the time of underwriting is expected to be materially consistent with the yield upon funding, given that interest rates are generally pegged to market indices and given the existence of milestones, conditions and/or obligations embedded in the borrowing agreements .

 Repurchase Program 
 On February 24, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the First Repurchase Program under which we were authorized to repurchase up to 25.0 million of our outstanding common stock, at management s discretion from time to time in open-market transactions and in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations. We repurchased 871,345 shares of our common stock under the First Repurchase Program for an aggregate purchase price of 10.8 million. The First Repurchase Program expired on February 24, 2023. 
 On November 2, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the "Second Repurchase Program"), under which we were authorized to repurchase up to 25.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, at management s discretion from time to time in open-market transactions and in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations. We repurchased 1,961,938 shares in connection with the Second Repurchase Program for an aggregate purchase price of 23.5 million. The Second Repurchase Program expired on November 2, 2024. 
 On July 30, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the "Third Repurchase Program") under which we may repurchase up to 15.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, at management's discretion from time to time in open-market transactions and in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations. If not renewed, the Third Repurchase Program will terminate upon the earlier of (i) July 30, 2025 or (ii) the repurchase of 15.0 million of our shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased 644,763 shares in connection with the Third Repurchase Program for an aggregate purchase price of 6.7 million. 
 Distributions 
 To the extent that we have funds available, we intend to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders. Our stockholder distributions, if any, will be determined by our Board of Directors. Any distribution to our stockholders will be declared out of assets legally available for distribution. We anticipate that distributions will be paid from income primarily generated by interest and dividend income earned on investments made by us. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we declared and paid dividends in the amount of 17.3 million and 54.9 million, respectively, of which 17.1 million and 54.1 million, respectively, were distributed in cash and the remainder distributed in shares to stockholders pursuant to our Dividend Reinvestment Plan. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we declared dividends in the amount of 18.2 million and 54.7 million, respectively, of which 17.5 million and 52.4 million, respectively, were distributed in cash and the remainder distributed in shares to stockholders pursuant to our Dividend Reinvestment Plan. 
 The timing and amount of our distributions, if any, will be determined by our Board of Directors and will be declared out of assets legally available for distribution. Refer to "Note 9 Net Assets" of our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a summary of the distributions declared and paid since inception. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the period reports. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. For a description of our critical accounting policies, including those related to the valuation of investments and our election to be treated, and intent to qualify annually, as a RIC refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Fair Value Measurements and Income Taxes.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We commenced investment activities in portfolio securities during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, and commenced investment activities in U.S. Treasury Bills during the quarter ended December 31, 2016. 
 We are subject to financial market risk, including changes in the valuations of our investment portfolio. Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. The prices of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the companies we invest in; conditions affecting the general economy; overall market changes; legislative reform; local, regional, national or global political, social or economic instability; and interest rate fluctuations. Uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of rising interest rates and inflation has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effects of this volatility could materially impact our market risks. 
 Valuation Risk 
 Our investments may not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is possible that the difference could be material. 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments, and cash and cash equivalents. Changes in interest rates can also affect our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio. Our net investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates, including SOFR and Prime rates. Increasing interest rates could have the effect of increasing our total investment income once interest rates increase above contractual interest rates floors to which our portfolio companies are subject. Conversely, we would expect the cost of our floating rate Credit Facility to increase as well, offsetting the positive effect on our net interest income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 100.0 of our performing debt portfolio investments bore interest at variable rates, consisting of approximately 75.0 based on SOFR and 25.0 based on Prime. As a policy, any interest above the cash cap, if applicable, as determined on an individual loan basis will accrue to principal and be treated as PIK interest. A hypothetical 200 basis point increase or decrease in the interest rates on our variable-rate debt investments could increase our investment income by a maximum of 18.8 million and decrease our investment income by a maximum of 14.4 million, due to certain floors, on an annual basis. 
 Our debt borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate, all other outstanding debt borrowings bear interest at a fixed rate. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest on a per annum basis equal to the SOFR plus an applicable margin rate that ranges from 2.95 to 3.35 per annum depending on our leverage ratio and number of eligible loans in the collateral pool. For additional information regarding the interest rate associated with each of our debt borrowings, refer to "Note 7 Borrowings" to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 Because we currently borrow, and plan to borrow in the future, to originate loans and securities, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. 
 We regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. We may hedge against interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. 
 In addition, any investments we make that are denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates. These risks include the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls and potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved, and may be exacerbated by current economic conditions and any associated impact on foreign financial markets. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15 under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
