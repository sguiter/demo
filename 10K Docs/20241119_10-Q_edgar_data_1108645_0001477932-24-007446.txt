Cash used for investing activities in 2024 was related to software implementation costs, which were written off and recorded as a loss on disposal during the third quarter of 2024. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2023 were all related to the purchase of intangible assets and property and equipment. The Company had net cash flows from financing activities of 1,091,408 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,004,150 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash flows from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were the result of 1,487,015 in proceeds from loan agreements and 645,607 in repayments of loan agreements and 250,000 in proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes. Cash flows from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were the result of 3,474,950 in proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and 470,800 in repayments of loan agreements. Our ability to successfully execute our business plan is contingent upon us obtaining additional financing and/or upon realizing revenues sufficient to fund our ongoing expenses. Until we are able to sustain our ongoing operations through revenues, we intend to fund operations through debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund our capital expenditures, working capital, or other cash requirements. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. The Company expects to raise significant debt or equity capital in order to fund expanding operations in the near future. 19 Table of Contents Results of Operations Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s revenues totaled 4,540,082 and 930,277, respectively. The source of our revenues comes from engineering, procurement and construction services EPC and consulting services performed for solar energy projects. Gross loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 92,414 compared to gross profit of 232,021 in the comparable prior year period. The Company recognized revenues on three additional projects during the third quarter accounting for the increase in revenues. The pressure on gross margin continued in the third quarter due to unexpected cost overruns on one of our core projects which resulted in lower revenue recognition in the third quarter and a decrease in our profit margin on this project. We anticipate the Company s revenues and gross margins in upcoming quarters to increase from the current level as revenues are recognized from projects in progress and in the pipeline and as we commercialize new project opportunities and cover more fixed costs within cost of sales expanding our margins. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our operating expenses were 1,577,773 compared to 1,820,560 for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease of 242,787, or 13 , was primarily driven by lower stock-based compensation of 130,961 and a net decrease in general and administrative expenses of 74,992 in the third quarter of 2024 driven by lower marketing and legal costs partially offset by an increase in payroll and related expenses associated with added strategic management. We anticipate future operating expenses to increase with the expansion of operations, resulting in increased expenses related to wages and compensation, advertising, and insurance partially offset by added contribution margins from anticipated revenue growth. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other expenses totaled 624,282 compared to 1,795,178 in the comparable prior year period. The 1,170,896 decrease in other expenses was primarily driven by the decrease in amortization of debt discount of 1,369,230 and lower interest expense of 162,954 related to 2023 note agreements with no similar activity in the comparable period of 2024, as the majority of these notes were converted during the second quarter of 2024. We anticipate other expenses to continue to be driven by these factors on a comparable basis throughout 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a loss on disposal of assets of 132,497 due to the write-off of software implementation costs. The activities above resulted in net losses of 2,294,469 and 3,383,717 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Comparison of the Nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s revenues were 6,836,123 and 5,139,133, respectively. The source of our revenues comes from engineering, procurement and construction services EPC and consulting services performed for solar energy projects. Gross loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 758,741 compared to gross profit of 1,311,704 in the comparable prior year period. The Company experienced a slowdown in one of its core projects due to unexpected cost overruns which resulted in lower revenue recognition during the year and a decrease in our profit margin on this project. We anticipate the Company s revenues and gross margins in upcoming quarters to continue to increase from the current level as revenues are recognized from projects in progress and in the pipeline and as we commercialize new project opportunities and cover more fixed costs within cost of sales expanding our margins. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses were 6,365,814 compared to 4,489,070 in the comparable prior year period. The increase of 1,876,744, or 42 , was primarily driven by an increase in stock-based compensation expenses of 1,083,740 and payroll and related expenses of 829,434 (included in general and administrative expenses). These increases were the result of the addition of strategic management as well as both internal and outsourced staff to support our continued expansion efforts. We anticipate future operating expenses to increase with the expansion of operations, resulting in increased expenses related to wages and compensation, advertising, and insurance partially offset by added contribution margins from anticipated revenue growth. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other expenses totaled 21,872,022, compared to 5,186,041 in the comparable prior year period. The 16,685,981 increase in other expenses was primarily driven by the 16,861,344 loss on conversion of debt. We expect other expenses to be driven by the loss on conversion on a comparable basis throughout the remainder of 2024. The activities above resulted in net losses of 28,996,577 and 8,363,407 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 20 Table of Contents Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We are a smaller reporting company and, therefore, we are not required to provide information required by this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is accumulated and communicated to the appropriate management on a basis that permits timely decisions regarding disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our management concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s periodic filings under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our disclosure controls and procedures provide our management with reasonable assurances that our disclosure controls and procedures will achieve their objectives. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting can or will prevent all human error. A control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Furthermore, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are internal resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be weighed relative to their corresponding costs. Because of the limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide complete assurance that all control issues and instances of error, if any, within our company are detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur due to human error or mistake. Additionally, controls, no matter how well designed, could be circumvented by the individual acts of specific persons within the organization. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated objectives under all potential future conditions. 21 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
