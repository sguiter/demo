CAUTIONARY
NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements, other
than statements of historical facts, contained in this report, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations, future
financial position, future revenue, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management and expected market growth, are forward-looking
statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, could, 
 will, would, should, expect, plan, , anticipate, believe, 
 estimate, intend, predict, seek, contemplate, project, 
 continue, potential, ongoing or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. 

Any
forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed throughout this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q. Some of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or
projections contained in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 

our
 ability to obtain additional funds for our operations; 

our
 financial performance; 

risks
 relating to the timing and costs of clinical trials and the timing and costs of other expenses; 

risks
 related to market acceptance of products; 

intellectual
 property risks; 

the
 impact of government regulation and developments relating to our competitors or our industry; 

our
 competitive position; 

our
 industry environment; 

our
 anticipated financial and operating results, including anticipated sources of revenues; 

assumptions
 regarding the size of the available market, benefits of our products, product pricing and
 timing of product launches; 

our
 estimates of our expenses, losses, future revenue and capital requirements, including our
 needs for additional financing; 

our
 ability to attract and retain qualified key management and technical personnel; 

statements
 regarding our goals, intensions, plans and expectations, including the introduction of new
 products and markets; 

our
 cash needs and financing plans. 

These
statements relate to future events or our future operational or financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ
materially from current expectations include, among other things, those listed under the section titled Risk Factors and
elsewhere in this report. 

Any
forward-looking statement in this report reflects our current view with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks,
uncertainties and assumptions relating to our business, results of operations, industry and future growth. Given these uncertainties,
you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance.
You should read this report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from any
future results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 

This
report also contains estimates, projections and other information concerning our industry, our business and our markets, including data
regarding the estimated size of those markets and their projected growth rates. Information that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections
or similar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties and actual events or circumstances may differ materially from events
and circumstances reflected in this information. Unless otherwise expressly stated, we obtained these industry, business, market and
other data from reports, research surveys, studies and similar data prepared by third parties, industry, and general publications, government
data and similar sources. While we believe that the reports, research surveys, studies and similar data prepared by third parties are
reliable, we have not independently verified the data contained in them. 

You
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Except as
required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect
any events or circumstances, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise, after the date
hereof. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors will arise. In addition, we cannot
assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results
to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We qualify all of the information presented in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, and particularly our forward-looking statements, by these cautionary statements.

or 23.4 . The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in legal and accounting fees of 24,659, a decrease in other consulting
fees of 77,365, and a decrease in stock-based consulting fees of 22,517 related to the amortization of prepaid expense on previously
issued shares to consultants for business advisory and strategic planning services, offset by an increase in investor relations of 45,264.

For

or 29.3 . The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in other consulting fees of 322,288, a decrease in legal fees of 172,516,
and a decrease in stock-based consulting fees of 90,067 related to the amortization of prepaid expense on previously issued shares to
consultants for business advisory and strategic planning services, offset by an increase in investor relations of 201,876, and an increase

an increase of 343,053, or 196.6 . 

For

an increase of 784,310, or 154.4 . 

The
increase was a result of an increase in research and development costs in connection with the Investigator-sponsored Study Agreement
with UCSF, UMB, Columbia University, and other parties. 

Insurance
 Expense : 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, insurance expense was 21,100 and 25,915, respectively, a decrease of 4,815, or

 8,906, or 12.2 . 

This decrease was a result of decrease in the cost of renewal of the D O insurance policy. 

Selling,
 General and Administrative Expenses : 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses include advertising and promotion, patent related expenses, public company expenses, custodian fees,
bank service charges, travel, and other office expenses. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses (income) were 59,350 and (127,904),
respectively, a negative change of 187,254 or 146.4 . The change was primarily attributed to a decrease in Delaware franchise taxes
of 166,369 resulting from a reincorporation of the Company in Nevada, offset by a net increase in other general and administrative expenses
of 20,885. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses were 174,281
and 176,162, respectively, a decrease of 1,881 or 1.1 .

respectively, an increase of 200,474, or 7.4 .

or 28.3 . The decrease in other income, net was primarily due to a decrease in interest and dividend income of 31,238, and an increase
in foreign currency transaction loss of 2,618, offset by a decrease in net realized loss on short-term investments of 1,862. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other income (expense), net amounted to 230,082 and 112,361, respectively, an increase
of 117,721, or 104.8 . The increase in other income (expenses), net was primarily due to a decrease in penalty expense of 166,034 which
was incurred during the 2023 period due to the early termination of a certificate of deposit, a decrease in net unrealized loss on equity
investment of 3,118, and a decrease in net realized loss on short-term investments of 3,016, offset by an increase in foreign currency

our obligations for a minimum of twelve months from the date of this filing.

than cash requirements pursuant to research and development agreements, we currently have no other material commitments for any capital
expenditures. 

Liquidity

reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, we generated a net loss of 2,662,260 and used cash in operations
of 2,916,482 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, we have an accumulated deficit of 13,534,071 on September
30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 7,216,955. 

The
positive working capital serves to mitigate the conditions that historically raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern. We believe that the Company has sufficient cash to meet its obligations for a minimum of twelve months from the date
of this filing.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

None. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation , which
requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for
an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange
for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee
services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures
as they occur as permitted under Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment. 

Research
and Development 

In
accordance with ASC 730-10, Research and Development-Overall, research and development costs are expensed when incurred. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective or Adopted 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material impact
on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are not required to provide the information required by this Item as we are a smaller reporting company, as defined in
Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic
reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or 1934 Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer (principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) under the 1934 Act, as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based on this evaluation, because of the Company s limited resources and limited number of employees, management
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

The
ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses which we identified in
our internal control over financial reporting: 

We
 lack segregation of duties within accounting functions duties as a result of our limited financial resources to support hiring of
 personnel; and. 

We
 have not implemented adequate system and manual controls. 

Until
such time as we expand our staff to include additional accounting personnel, it is likely we will continue to report material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
