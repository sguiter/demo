As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, we had net current assets (current assets less current liabilities) of 24.7 million and 22.7 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, we incurred loss from operations amounting to 0.8 million and 0.2 million; for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, we incurred loss from operations amounting to 7.0 million and 1.9 million, and negative cash flows from operating activities of 4.6 million and positive cash flows from operating activities of 1.7 million, respectively. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate cash flows from operations, and to make adequate financing arrangements. We had cash and cash equivalents of 33.2 million, excluding restricted cash of 5.2 million as of September 30, 2024. The cash reserve is expected to meet our operating needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. However, if negative cash flow from operating activities persists in the long run, our cash resources may become insufficient to satisfy on-going cash requirements. Cash is held at multiple financial institutions. We have diversified our deposits with various banks to reduce our potential exposure to bank failures, such as Silicon Valley Bank s failure in March 2023.

Trend Information Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Refer to Part II, Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates disclosed therein. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide information typically disclosed under this item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in by the SEC s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to the two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the year ended December 31, 2022, our management identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which remain unremediated as of September 30, 2024, as follows: Lack of an integrated and systematic risk assessment and reporting process to identify and assess the financial reporting risks and to ensure significant transactions including investments and non-routine transactions including share-based transactions are accurately recorded and properly disclosed; and Lack of evaluations to ascertain whether the components of internal control are present and functioning. 
 Management s Remediation Plans and Actions To remediate the material weaknesses described above in Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting, we are implementing the plan and measures described below. We will continue to evaluate and, may in the future, implement additional measures. We have recruited personnel with the requisite knowledge in accounting and disclosure requirements for complex transactions under U.S. GAAP and statutory compliance. Where needed, we have engaged external parties with the expertise to evaluate and advise the company on complex or evolving areas such as public company filings, taxation, and valuation services. We have designed a control environment which allows management to monitor the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and address gaps identified within the environment. We have implemented a consolidated general ledger within a single enterprise resource planning application for all legal entities, which includes consolidation and statutory reporting capabilities. We will design and implement evaluation policies and procedures to ascertain internal control components are present and functioning. 
 We believe that we are taking the steps necessary for remediation of the material weaknesses identified above, and we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these steps and to make any changes that our management deems appropriate. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Other than as described above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonable likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures Our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system cannot provide absolute assurance due to its inherent limitations; it is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. A control system also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of such limitations, disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting cannot prevent or detect all misstatements, whether unintentional errors or fraud. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process, therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
