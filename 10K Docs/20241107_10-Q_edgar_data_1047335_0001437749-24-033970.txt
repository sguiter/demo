skilled nursing facilities with a total of licensed beds, assisted living facilities with 1,413 units, independent living facilities, behavioral health hospitals, homecare agencies, and hospice agencies. We operate specialized care units within certain of our healthcare centers such as Alzheimer's disease care units and sub-acute nursing units. In addition, we provide insurance services, management and accounting services, and we lease properties to operators of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. We operate in states and are located primarily in the southeastern United States. 

The Company recognizes revenue as its performance obligations are completed. Routine services are treated as a single performance obligation satisfied over time as services are rendered. These routine services represent a bundle of services that are not capable of being distinct. The performance obligations are satisfied over time as the patient simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the healthcare services provided. Additionally, there may be ancillary services which are not included in the daily rates for routine services, but instead are treated as separate performance obligations satisfied at a point in time when those services are rendered. Contract liabilities are recorded for payments the Company receives in which performance obligations have not been completed. 
 
 The Company determines the transaction price based on established billing rates reduced by explicit price concessions provided to third party payors. Explicit price concessions are based on contractual agreements and historical experience. The Company considers the patient's ability and intent to pay the amount of consideration upon admission. Credit losses are recorded as bad debt expense, which is included as a component of other operating expenses in the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations. Bad debt expense was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, bad debt expense was and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded allowance for doubtful accounts of and , respectively, as our best estimate of expected losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. 

reportable operating segments: 1 inpatient services, which includes the operation of skilled nursing facilities, assisted and independent living facilities, and behavioral health hospitals, and 2 homecare and hospice services. The Company also reports an all other category that includes revenues from rental income, management and accounting services fees, insurance services, and costs of the corporate office. See Note 7 for further disclosure of the Company s operating segments. 

and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. General and administrative costs were and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increased general and administrative costs incurred during 2024 are due to acquisition-related expenses for the White Oak Senior Living portfolio. See Note 3 - Acquisition of White Oak Senior Living for additional detail regarding the acquisition. 

- years and equipment and furniture, - years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over periods that do not exceed the non-cancelable respective lease terms using the straight-line method. 

We are principally self-insured for incidents occurring in all centers owned or leased by us. The coverage includes both primary policies and excess policies. In all years, settlements, if any, in excess of available insurance policy limits and our own reserves would be expensed by us. 
 
 of the resident entry fee becomes non-refundable upon occupancy, and the remaining refundable portion of the entry fee is calculated using the lesser of the price at which the apartment is re-assigned or of the original entry fee, plus of any appreciation if the apartment value exceeds the original resident s entry fee. 
 
 Non-refundable fees are included as a component of the transaction price and are amortized into revenue over the actuarily determined remaining life of the resident, which is the expected period of occupancy by the resident. We pay the refundable portion of our entry fees to residents when they relocate from our community and the apartment is re-occupied. Refundable entrance fees are not included as part of the transaction price and are classified as noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 We also annually estimate the present value of the cost of future services and the use of facilities to be provided to the current CCRC residents and compare that amount with the balance of non-refundable deferred revenue from entrance fees received. If the present value of the cost of future services exceeds the related anticipated revenues, a liability is recorded with a corresponding charge to income. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we have recorded a future service obligation liability in the amount of . This obligation is reflected within other noncurrent liabilities in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

. The White Oak portfolio consists of healthcare operations, which includes skilled nursing facilities, two assisted living facilities, independent living facilities, and a long-term care pharmacy. The operations have 1,928 licensed skilled nursing beds, 48 assisted living units, and independent living units in the states of South Carolina and North Carolina total beds/units). The acquisition represents both an expansion of NHC s operations into a new state (North Carolina) and a strategic advancement of its growth in its existing operational footprint. 
 
 The Company utilized widely accepted income-based, market-based, and cost-based valuation approaches to perform the preliminary purchase price allocation. 
 
 The Company has performed a preliminary valuation analysis of the fair market value of White Oak s assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The final valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was not complete as of September 30, 2024, but will be finalized within the allowable measurement period. The following table summarizes the allocation of the preliminary purchase price as of the transaction s closing date in thousands ): 

Inventories 
 Prepaid expenses and other assets 
 Property and equipment 
 Deferred tax asset 
 Operating lease right-of-use assets 
 Intangible assets 
 Total assets acquired 
 
 Operating lease liabilities, current portion 
 Accrued payroll 
 Other current liabilities 
 Operating lease liabilities, less current portion 
 Other noncurrent liabilities 
 Total liabilities assumed 
 
 Net identifiable assets acquired 
 Goodwill 
 Total estimated fair value of the acquisition 

The indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired include the trade name of White Oak and the skilled nursing certificates of need and licenses. The goodwill is recorded in the inpatient services segment and is attributed to the workforce acquired and reputation of the business as part of the transaction. We expect the goodwill to be deductible for income tax purposes. 
 
 For the and months ended September 30, 2024, White Oak contributed net operating revenues of and income before income taxes of that are included in the Company s interim condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized and in acquisition-related expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, in connection with the White Oak acquisition. These costs related to legal and other professional fees, which were included as a component of other operating expenses in the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 The following table contains unaudited pro forma interim condensed consolidated statements of operations information for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, assuming that the White Oak acquisition closed on January 1, 2023. The pro forma financial information includes various assumptions, including those related to the preliminary purchase price allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The pro forma financial information may vary in future quarters based on the final valuations and analysis of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands) . 

Income before income taxes 
 Net income attributable to NHC 

Homecare and hospice 

Total net patient revenue 

For inpatient and hospice services, revenue is recognized on a daily basis as each day represents a separate contract and performance obligation. For homecare, revenue is recognized when services are provided based on the number of days of service rendered in the period of care or on a per-visit basis. Typically, patients and third -party payors are billed monthly after services are performed or the patient is discharged, and payments are due based on contract terms. 
 
 As our performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of one year or less, the Company is not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period. The Company has minimal unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the reporting period as our patients are typically under no obligation to remain admitted in our facilities or under our care. As the period between the time of service and time of payment is typically one year or less, the Company did not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component. 
 
 Revenue by Payor 
 
 Certain groups of patients receive funds to pay the cost of their care from a common source. The following table sets forth sources of net patient revenues for the periods indicated: 

Managed Care 

Medicaid 

Private Pay and Other 

Total 

Medicare covers skilled nursing services for beneficiaries who require nursing care and/or rehabilitation services following a hospitalization of at least three consecutive days. For each eligible day a Medicare beneficiary is in a skilled nursing facility, Medicare pays the facility a daily payment, subject to adjustment for certain factors such as a wage index in the geographic area. The payment covers all services provided by the skilled nursing facility for the beneficiary that day, including room and board, nursing, therapy and drugs, as well as an estimate of capital related costs to deliver those services. 
 
 For homecare services, Medicare pays based on the acuity level of the patient and based on periods of care. A period of care is defined as a length of care up to 30 days with multiple continuous periods allowed. The services covered by the payment include all disciplines of care, in addition to medical supplies, within the scope of the home health benefit. 
 
 For hospice services, Medicare pays a daily rate to cover the hospice s costs for providing services included in the patient care plan. Medicare makes daily payments based on 1 of 4 levels of hospice care. All hospice care and services offered to patients and their families must follow an individualized written plan of care that meets the patient s needs. 

Our hospice service revenue is subject to certain limitations on payments from Medicare. We are subject to an inpatient cap limit and an overall Medicare payment cap for each provider number. We monitor these caps on a provider-by-provider basis and estimate amounts due back to Medicare if we estimate a cap has been exceeded. If applicable, we record these cap adjustments as a reduction to revenue. 
 
 Medicaid is operated by individual states with the financial participation of the federal government. The states in which we operate currently use prospective cost based reimbursement systems. Under cost based reimbursement systems, the skilled nursing facility is reimbursed for the reasonable direct and indirect allowable costs it incurred in a base year in providing routine resident care services as defined by the program. 
 
 Private pay, managed care, and other payment sources include commercial insurance, individual patient funds, managed care plans and the Veterans Administration. Private paying patients, private insurance carriers and the Veterans Administration generally pay based on the healthcare center's charges or specifically negotiated contracts. For private pay patients in skilled nursing, assisted living and independent living facilities, the Company bills for room and board charges, with the remittance being due on receipt of the statement and generally by the 10th day of the month the services are performed. 
 
 Certain managed care payors for homecare services pay on a per-visit basis. This revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of services at amounts equal to its established or estimated per-visit rates. 
 
 State Relief Supplemental Funding 
 
 The Company received supplemental Medicaid payments from various states, including healthcare relief funding under the American Rescue Plan Act ("ARPA") and other state specific relief programs. The funding generally incorporates specific use requirements primarily for direct patient care including labor related expenses or various patient care related expenses. We have recorded and in net patient revenues for these supplemental Medicaid payments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have recorded and in net patient revenues for these supplemental Medicaid payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Third Party Payors 
 
 Laws and regulations governing Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. Noncompliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to regulatory actions including fines, penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We believe that we are following all applicable laws and regulations. 
 
 Medicare and Medicaid program revenues, as well as certain Managed Care program revenues, are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by government representatives or their agents. Settlements with third -party payors for retroactive adjustments due to audits, reviews or investigations are considered variable consideration and are included in the determination of the estimated transaction price for providing patient care. These settlements are estimated based on the terms of the payment agreement with the payor, correspondence from the payor and the Company s historical settlement activity, including an assessment to ensure that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the retroactive adjustment is subsequently resolved. Estimated settlements are adjusted in future periods as adjustments become known, or as years are settled or are no longer subject to such audits, reviews, and investigations. We believe that any differences between the net revenues recorded, and final determination will not materially affect the consolidated financial statements. We have made provisions of approximately and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, for various Medicare, Medicaid, and Managed Care claims reviews and current and prior year cost reports.

 The Company leases real estate assets consisting of skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities to third party operators. Additionally, we sublease Florida skilled nursing facilities included in our lease from National Health Investors NHI as noted in Note 8 Long Term Leases.

 We manage skilled nursing facilities owned by National Health Corporation National ). We recognized management fees and interest on management fees from these facilities of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Total long-term debt 

On August 1, 2024, the Company entered into a senior credit facility with a five -year term consisting of a term facility and a revolving line of credit (the Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility is for general corporate purposes, including working capital and acquisitions. The loans bear interest at either (i) Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR for interest periods of one, three or six months, plus the applicable margin or, at NHC s option, (ii) the Base Rate plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin is an interest rate per annum between and for Term SOFR loans and between .30 and .65 for Base Rate loans, depending upon the Company meeting certain conditions. The revolving line of credit contains a commitment fee equal to of the unused borrowing capacity. There are amounts outstanding on the revolving line of credit at September 30, 2024. 
 
 NHC s obligations under the Credit Facility are unsecured. The Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties, financial covenants, and other customary affirmative and negative covenants. The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is compliant with all financial covenants. Based on level 2 inputs, the carrying value of the Company's long-term debt is considered to approximate the fair value of such debt based upon the interest rates that the Company believes it can currently obtain for similar debt.

and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Company's income tax provision as a percentage of our income before income taxes was and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Typically, these percentages vary from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of primarily due to state income taxes, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, benefits resulting from the lapsing of statute of limitations of items in our tax contingency reserve, and non-deductible expenses. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the accrual of state income tax was the most significant reconciling item. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the accrual of state income tax was the only significant reconciling items. 

Our quarterly income tax provision, and our estimate of our annual effective income tax rate, is subject to variation due to several factors, including volatility based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. 
 
 The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state examinations by tax authorities for years before 2020 (with certain state exceptions). 

and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The liability is included in accrued risk reserves in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets and is subject to adjustment for actual claims incurred. It is possible that these claims plus unasserted claims could exceed our insurance coverages and our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 As a result of the terms of our insurance policies and our use of wholly owned limited purpose insurance companies, we have retained significant insurance risk with respect to workers compensation and general and professional liability. We consider the professional services of independent actuaries to assist us in estimating our exposures for claims obligations (for both asserted and unasserted claims) related to deductibles and exposures in excess of coverage limits, and we maintain reserves for these obligations. Such estimates are based on many variables including historical and statistical information and other factors. 
 
 Workers Compensation 
 
 For workers compensation, we utilize a wholly owned Tennessee domiciled property/casualty insurance company to write coverage for NHC affiliates and for third party customers. Policies are written for a duration of twelve months and cover only risks related to workers compensation losses. All customers are companies which operate in the senior care industry. Business is written on a direct basis. 
 
 General and Professional Liability Insurance and Lawsuits 
 
 The senior care industry has experienced significant increases in both the number of personal injury/wrongful death claims and in the severity of awards based upon alleged negligence by skilled nursing facilities and their employees in providing care to residents. The Company has been, and continues to be, subject to claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business, including potential claims related to patient care and treatment. The defense of these lawsuits may result in significant legal costs, regardless of the outcome, and can result in large settlement amounts or damage awards. Additional insurance is purchased through third party providers that serve to supplement the coverage provided through our wholly owned captive insurance company. 
 
 There is certain additional litigation incidental to our business, none of which, based upon information available to date, would be material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, the long term care industry is continuously subject to scrutiny by governmental regulators, which could result in litigation or claims related to regulatory compliance matters. 
 
 Qui Tam Litigation 
 
 United States of America, ex rel. Jennifer Cook and Sally Gaither v. Integrated Behavioral Health, Inc., NHC HealthCare/Moulton, LLC, et al., Case No. 2:20 -CV- 00877 -AMM (N.D. Ala.) This is a qui tam case originally filed under seal on June 22, 2020. The United States declined intervention on March 1, 2021. Thereafter, the Plaintiffs filed an amended Complaint against Dr. Sanja Malhotra, Integrated Behavioral Health, Inc. and other entities that Dr. Malhotra was alleged to own or in which he allegedly had a financial interest. The Complaint also named multiple skilled nursing facilities as Defendants, including NHC Healthcare/Moulton, LLC, an affiliate of National HealthCare Corporation. The Complaint alleged that nurse practitioners affiliated with Dr. Malhotra provided free services to the facilities in exchange for referrals to entities owned by or in which Dr. Malhotra had a financial interest in violation of the False Claims Act and Anti-Kickback Statute. NHC Healthcare/Moulton, LLC denied the allegations and filed a motion to dismiss on November 4, 2021. On January 28, 2022, the district court stayed this matter and administratively terminated the motion to dismiss pending the U.S. Supreme Court's review of a petition for certiorari filed in an unrelated matter but involving one of the legal arguments raised in the motion to dismiss. Thereafter, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition for certiorari in the unrelated matter. As a result, NHC Healthcare/Moulton, LLC renewed its motion to dismiss. The District Court granted NHC Healthcare/Moulton s Motion to Dismiss, along with other pending Motions to Dismiss, and entered an Order of Dismissal on March 23, 2023 and an Amended Order of Dismissal on April 4, 2023, which dismissed the case in its entirety with prejudice with respect to the claims asserted by the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal on April 20, 2023 to appeal the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On December 21, 2023, the Eleventh Circuit entered an Order affirming the District Court s dismissal of the claims. The time period for the Plaintiffs to file a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the United States Supreme Court has expired making the Order affirming dismissal issued by the Eleventh Circuit final. 

Civil Investigative Demand 
 
 On or about May 21, 2024, Caris Healthcare, L.P. Caris received a Civil Investigative Demand CID from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee. The CID requests the production of certain medical records for patients at Caris Nashville office and other documents related to the billing for hospice services for the period of January 1, 2019, through the date of the CID. The Company is cooperating with respect to the requests and remains in the process of responding to the CID. 
 
 Governmental Regulations 
 
 Laws and regulations governing Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs are complex and subject to interpretation. Management believes that it is following all applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. However, compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines, penalties, and exclusions from the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.

 Overview 
 
 National HealthCare Corporation NHC or the Company is a leading provider of senior health care services. As of September 30, 2024, we operate or manage, through certain affiliates, 80 skilled nursing facilities with a total of 10,349 licensed beds, 26 assisted living facilities with 1,413 units, nine independent living facilities, three behavioral health hospitals, 34 homecare agencies, and 32 hospice agencies. We operate specialized care units within certain of our healthcare centers such as Alzheimer's disease care units and sub-acute nursing units.

We operate in 9 states and are located primarily in the southeastern United States. 
 
 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Minimum Staffing Standards 
 
 On April 22, 2024, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS issued the Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care LTC Facilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting final rule. Included in this final rule are new comprehensive minimum nurse staffing requirements, which aim to significantly reduce the risk of residents receiving unsafe and low-quality care within LTC facilities. CMS is finalizing a total nurse staffing standard of 3.48 hours per resident day HPRD ), which must include at least 0.55 HPRD of direct registered nurse RN care and 2.45 HPRD of direct nurse aide care. Facilities may use any combination of nurse staff (RN, licensed practical nurse and licensed vocational nurse, or nurse aide) to account for the additional 0.48 HPRD needed to comply with the total nurse staffing standard. 
 
 CMS is also finalizing enhanced facility assessment requirements and a requirement to have an RN onsite 24 hours a day, seven days a week 24/7 ), to provide skilled nursing care. The 24/7 RN onsite can be the Director of Nursing; however, they must be available to provide direct resident care. 
 
 This final rule provides a staggered implementation timeframe of the minimum nurse staffing standards and a 24/7 RN requirement based on geographic location, as well as possible exemptions for qualifying facilities for some parts of these requirements based on workforce unavailability and other factors. 
 
 Summary of Goals and Areas of Focus 
 
 Occupancy 
 
 A primary area of management focus continues to be the rates of occupancy within our skilled nursing facilities. The overall census in owned and leased skilled nursing facilities for the three months ending September 30, 2024 was 88.3 compared to 88.1 for the same period a year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, overall census in our owned and leased skilled nursing facilities was 88.6 compared to 87.8 for the same period a year ago.

Due to America s healthcare labor shortage, the challenge of maintaining desirable patient census levels has been amplified. Management has undertaken a number of steps in order to best position our current and future health care facilities. This includes working internally to examine and improve systems to be most responsive to referral sources and payors, as well as find creative initiatives to retain and attract qualified healthcare professionals. Additionally, NHC is in various stages of partnerships with hospital systems, payors, and other post acute alliances to better position ourselves so we are an active participant in the delivery of post-acute healthcare services. 
 
 Quality of Patient Care 
 
 CMS introduced the Five-Star Quality Rating System to help consumers, their families and caregivers compare skilled nursing facilities more easily. The Five-Star Quality Rating System gives each skilled nursing operation a rating ranging between one and five stars in various categories (five stars being the best). The Company has always strived for patient-centered care and quality outcomes as precursors to outstanding financial performance. 
 
 The tables below summarize NHC's overall performance in these Five-Star ratings versus the skilled nursing industry as of September 30, 2024:

On August 1, 2024, the Company purchased the White Oak portfolio, including its long-term care pharmacy. The White Oak portfolio consists of 15 skilled nursing facilities, two assisted living facilities, and four independent living facilities. The White Oak operations have 1,928 licensed skilled nursing beds, 48 assisted living units, and 302 independent living units in the states of South Carolina and North Carolina. 
 
 Accrued Risk Reserves 
 
 Our accrued professional liability and workers compensation reserves totaled 110,204,000 at September 30, 2024 and are a primary area of management focus. We have set aside restricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund our estimated professional liability and workers compensation liabilities. 
 
 As to exposure for professional liability claims, we have developed performance certification criteria to measure and bring focus to the patient care issues most likely to produce professional liability exposure, including in house acquired pressure ulcers, significant weight loss and numbers of falls. These programs for certification, which we regularly modify and improve, have produced measurable improvements in reducing these incidents. Our experience is that achieving goals in these patient care areas improves both patient and employee satisfaction.

Government Reimbursement Programs 
 
 Medicare Skilled Nursing Facilities 
 
 In July 2023, CMS released its final rule outlining fiscal year 2024 Medicare payment rates and policy changes for skilled nursing facilities, which began on October 1, 2023. The fiscal year 2024 rule equates to a net increase of 4.0 , or approximately 1.4 billion, in Medicare Part A payments to SNFs in fiscal year 2024 compared to 2023 levels. The rule includes a 3.0 market basket rate increase, a 3.6 market basket forecast error adjustment, less a 0.2 productivity adjustment, as well as a negative 2.3 , or approximately 789 million, decrease in 2024 SNF Payment Prospective Systems rates as a result of the second phase of the Patient Driven Payment Model parity adjustment recalibration. 
 
 In July 2024, CMS released its final rule outlining fiscal year 2025 Medicare payment rates and policy changes for skilled nursing facilities, which began on October 1, 2024. The fiscal year 2025 rule equates to a net 4.2 increase in Medicare Part A payments to SNFs in fiscal year 2025 compared to 2024 levels. The rule includes a market basket increase of 3.0 , an increase of 1.7 to the market basket forecast error adjustment, and a negative 0.5 productivity adjustment. This final rule also changes CMS enforcement policies to impose more equitable and consistent civil monetary penalties ("CMPs") for health and safety violations as part of the agency s ongoing work to increase the safety and care provided in America s nursing homes. CMS revised the regulation to expand the type of CMPs that can be imposed to allow for more per instance and per day CMPs to be imposed, as appropriate. In the final rule it also finalized updates to the SNF Quality Reporting Program ("QRP") to better account for adverse social conditions that negatively impact individuals health or healthcare. CMS also finalized its proposal to adopt a data validation process for the SNF QRP beginning the same year. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, our average Medicare per diem rate for skilled nursing facilities increased 4.9 as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Medicaid Skilled Nursing Facilities 
 
 Effective July 1, 2024 and for the fiscal year 2025, the state of Tennessee implemented specific individual nursing facility increases. We estimate the resulting increase in revenue for the 2025 fiscal year will be approximately 11,000,000 annually, or 2,750,000 per quarter. Additionally, the state of Tennessee implemented non-recurring rate increases for fiscal year 2025 for continued stabilization payments and Medicaid rate rebasing. These non-recurring rate increases will result in an additional increase in revenue for the 2025 fiscal year of approximately 8,200,000 annually, or 2,050,000 per quarter. 
 
 Effective October 1, 2024 and for the fiscal year 2025, the state of South Carolina implemented specific individual nursing facility increases. We estimate the resulting increase in revenue for the 2025 fiscal year will be approximately 500,000 annually, or 125,000 per quarter. 
 
 Effective July 1, 2024 and for the fiscal year 2025, the state of Missouri has proposed specific individual nursing facility increases, subject to approval from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"). Upon CMS' approval, we estimate the resulting increase in revenue for the 2025 fiscal year will be approximately 6,600,000 annually, or 1,650,000 per quarter. 
 
 We have also received from many of the states in which we operate a supplemental Medicaid payment to help mitigate the inflationary labor and medical supplies costs resulting from the pandemic. We have recorded 5,267,000 and 4,232,000 in net patient revenues for these supplemental Medicaid payments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have recorded 11,314,000 and 15,3620,000 in net patient revenues for these supplemental Medicaid payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, our average Medicaid per diem increased 10.2 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 State Medicaid plans subject to budget constraints are of particular concern to us. Changes in federal funding coupled with state budget problems and Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act have produced an uncertain environment. Some states will not keep pace with post-acute healthcare inflation. States are currently under pressure to pursue other alternatives to skilled nursing care such as community and home based services. Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by states under approved plans. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a prospective payment system or under programs which negotiate payment levels with individual providers. Some states use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. 
 
 Medicare Homecare Programs 
 
 In November 2023, CMS released its final rule outlining fiscal year 2024 Medicare payment rates. CMS projects payments to home health agencies in fiscal year 2024 will increase in aggregate by 0.8 , or 140 million. The increase is the result of a 3.3 market basket update, reduced by a 0.3 productivity adjustment. The increase is offset by a behavioral adjustment that will cut payments by a net 2.6 . The behavioral adjustment was designed to achieve budget-neutral implementation of the PDPM. Finally, CMS also adjusted the fixed-dollar loss ratio for outlier payments, which will increase payments by 0.4 . 
 
 In June 2024, CMS released its proposed rule outlining fiscal year 2025 Medicare payment rates. CMS projects payments to home health agencies in fiscal year 2025 will decrease by 1.7 or 280 million, relative to the prior year. This decrease reflects a 2.5 home health payment update, reduced by a 3.6 decrease related to the Patient-Driven Groupings Model PDGM rebalancing and an estimated 0.6 decrease that reflects a proposed fixed dollar loss for outlier payments. As required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, this rule proposes a permanent prospective adjustment to the CY2025 home health payment rate to account for the impact of implementing the PDGM. This adjustment accounts for differences between assumed behavior changes and actual behavior changes on estimated aggregate expenditures due to the CY2020 implementation of PDGM and the change to a 30-day unit of payment.

These reportable operating segments are consistent with information used by the Company s Chief Executive Officer, as chief operating decision maker CODM ), to assess performance and allocate resources. The Company also reports an all other category that includes revenues from rental income, management and accounting services fees, insurance services, and costs of the corporate office. 
 
 The Company s CODM evaluates performance and allocates capital resources to each segment based on an operating model that is designed to improve the quality of patient care and profitability of the Company while enhancing long-term shareholder value. The CODM does not review assets by segment in his resource allocation and therefore, assets by segment are not disclosed below.

Non-GAAP Financial Presentation 
 
 The Company is providing certain non-GAAP financial measures as the Company believes that these figures are helpful in allowing investors to more accurately assess the ongoing nature of the Company s operations and measure the Company s performance more consistently across periods. Therefore, the Company believes this information is meaningful in addition to the information contained in the GAAP presentation of financial information. The presentation of this additional non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Specifically, the Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP financial information that excludes the unrealized gains or losses on our marketable equity securities, operating results for newly opened facilities or agencies not at full capacity, gains on sale of unconsolidated companies, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and the recognition of the employee retention credit is helpful in allowing investors to assess the Company s operations more accurately. 
 
 The operating results for newly opened facilities or agencies not at full capacity include newly constructed healthcare facilities or agencies that are still considered in the start-up phase, which are two hospice agencies for the three and nine months ended September 30, 3024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, included are two behavioral health hospitals, two homecare agencies, and two hospice agencies. The acquisition-related expenses represent expenses incurred to acquire the White Oak portfolio. 
 
 The tables below provide reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP items (dollars in thousands, except per share data):

Short term liquidity 
 
 We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily from our cash flows from operating activities. In addition to cash flows from operations, our current cash on hand of 84,807,000, our marketable equity securities of 164,754,000, and our borrowing capacity on the 50 million available line of credit are expected to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations, operating liquidity, and our growth and development plans in the next twelve months. We also have substantial value in our unencumbered real estate assets, which could potentially be used as collateral in future borrowing opportunities. 
 
 Long term liquidity 
 
 We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements primarily from our cash flows from operating activities, our current cash on hand of 84,807,000, our marketable equity securities of 164,754,000, and our borrowing capacity on the 50 million available line of credit. We also have substantial value in our unencumbered real estate assets, which could potentially be used as collateral in future borrowing opportunities. 
 
 Our ability to meet our long term contractual obligations, and to finance our operating requirements and growth plans will depend upon our future performance. Our future performance will be affected by business, economic, financial and other factors, including potential changes in state and federal government payment rates for healthcare, customer demand, success of our marketing efforts, pressures from competitors, and the state of the economy, including the state of financial and credit markets, as well as many unforeseen factors. 

Commitment and Contingencies 
 
 Governmental Regulations 
 
 Laws and regulations governing Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs are complex and subject to interpretation. Management believes that it is following all applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. However, compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines, penalties, and exclusions from the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. 

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. Currently, our exposure to market risk relates primarily to our fixed income and equity portfolios. These investment portfolios are exposed primarily to, but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, equity price risk, and concentration risk. We also have exposure to market risk that includes our cash and cash equivalents. The Company's senior management has established comprehensive risk management policies and procedures to manage these market risks. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The fair values of our fixed income investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases, respectively, in the fair values of those instruments. Additionally, the fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. At September 30, 2024, we have available for sale marketable debt securities in the amount of 123,911,000. The fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of investments with primarily short term and intermediate term maturities. The fixed maturity portfolio allows our insurance company subsidiaries to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet obligations. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our credit facility bears interest at variable interest rates. Currently, we have an outstanding balance on our credit facility of 147.0 million. Based on our outstanding balance on the credit facility, a 1 change in interest rates would change interest cost by approximately 1,470,000. 
 
 Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months when purchased. As a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments, a hypothetical 1 change in interest rates would have minimal impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments. 
 
 We do not currently use any derivative instruments to hedge our interest rate exposure. We have not used derivative instruments for trading purposes and the use of such instruments in the future would be subject to approvals by the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Credit risk is managed by diversifying the fixed maturity portfolio to avoid concentrations in any single industry group or issuer and by limiting investments in securities with lower credit ratings.

Table of Contents 

Equity Price and Concentration Risk 
 
 Our marketable equity securities are recorded at their fair market value based on quoted market prices. Thus, there is exposure to equity price risk, which is the potential change in fair value due to a change in quoted market prices. At September 30, 2024, the fair value of our marketable equity securities is approximately 187,755,000. Of the 187.8 million equity securities portfolio, our investment in NHI comprises approximately 137.1 million, or 73.0 , of the total fair value. We manage our exposure to NHI by closely monitoring the financial condition, performance, and outlook of the company. Hypothetically, a 10 change in quoted market prices would result in a related increase or decrease in the fair value of our equity investments of approximately 18.8 million. At September 30, 2024, our equity securities had net unrealized gains of 139.9 million. Of the 139.9 million of unrealized gains, 112.3 million is related to our investment in NHI. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures . 

As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 As permitted by guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of internal control over financial reporting of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management's evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, management excluded an assessment of the internal controls of White Oak Senior Living, which we acquired on August 1, 2024, from its evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. White Oak Senior Living represented 15 of our consolidated total assets and 4 of our consolidated total net operating revenues and grant income as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We are in the process of integrating White Oak Senior Living into our system of internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Other than with respect to the integration of White Oak Senior Living into our system of internal control over financial reporting, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
