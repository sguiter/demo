and of one ZEC at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the amount of ZEC represented by each Share is primarily a result of the periodic withdrawal of ZEC to pay the Sponsor s Fee. The cost basis of investments in ZEC recorded by the Trust is the fair value of ZEC, as determined by the Trust, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the date of transfer to the Trust by the Authorized Participant, or Liquidity Provider, based on the creation Baskets. The cost basis recorded by the Trust may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of each Share to investors. The Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider may realize significant profits buying, selling, creating, and, if permitted, redeeming Shares as a result of changes in the value of Shares or ZEC. At this time, the Trust is not operating a redemption program and is not accepting redemption requests. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval and approval by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Trust may in the future operate a redemption program. The Trust currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval to operate an ongoing redemption program.

on its net taxable income and certain distributions made by the Trust to shareholders would be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of the Trust s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Trust has defined the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, based on the largest benefit that is more than likely to be realized. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. As of, and during the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Trust did t have a liability for any unrecognized tax amounts. However, the Sponsor s conclusions concerning its determination of more-likely-than-not tax positions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, further implementation guidance, and ongoing analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Sponsor of the Trust has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that reserves for uncertain tax positions related to federal, state and local income taxes existed as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 . 

 and Shares of the Trust were held by related parties of the Trust, respectively. Genesis Global Trading, Inc. filed a certificate of dissolution during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and has therefore been removed from the list of related parties. The Sponsor s indirect parent, an affiliate of the Trust, holds a minority interest in Coinbase, Inc., the parent company of the Custodian, that represents less than of Coinbase, Inc. s ownership. In accordance with the Trust Agreement governing the Trust, the Trust pays a fee to the Sponsor, calculated as of the aggregate value of the Trust s assets, less its liabilities (which include any accrued but unpaid expenses up to, but excluding, the date of calculation), as calculated and published by the Sponsor or its delegates in the manner set forth in the Trust Agreement (the Sponsor s Fee ). The Sponsor s Fee accrues daily in U.S. dollars and is payable in ZEC, monthly in arrears. The amount of ZEC payable in respect of each daily U.S. dollar accrual will be determined by reference to the same U.S. dollar value of ZEC used to determine such accrual. For purposes of these financial statements, the U.S. dollar value of ZEC is determined by reference to the Digital Asset Trading Platform Market that the Trust considers its principal market as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each valuation date. The Trust held Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currencies have been distributed in payment of the Sponsor s Fee during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As partial consideration for receipt of the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor is obligated under the Trust Agreement to assume and pay all fees and other expenses incurred by the Trust in the ordinary course of its affairs, excluding taxes, but including marketing fees; administrator fees, if any; custodian fees; transfer agent fees; trustee fees; the fees and expenses related to the listing, quotation or trading of the Shares on any secondary market (including customary legal, marketing and audit fees and expenses) in an amount up to in any given fiscal year; ordinary course legal fees and expenses; audit fees; regulatory fees, including, if applicable, any fees relating to the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; printing and mailing costs; the costs of maintaining the Trust s website and applicable license fees (together, the Sponsor-paid Expenses ), provided that any expense that qualifies as an Additional Trust Expense will be deemed to be an Additional Trust Expense and not a Sponsor-paid Expense. The Trust may incur certain extraordinary, non-recurring expenses that are not Sponsor-paid Expenses, including, but not limited to, taxes and governmental charges, expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed by the Sponsor (or any other service provider) on behalf of the Trust to protect the Trust or the interests of shareholders (including in connection with any Incidental Rights and any IR Virtual Currency), any indemnification of the Custodian or other agents, service providers or counterparties of the Trust, the fees and expenses related to the listing, quotation or trading of the Shares on any secondary market (including legal, marketing and audit 

 12 

in any given fiscal year and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters (collectively Additional Trust Expenses ). In such circumstances, the Sponsor or its delegate (i) will instruct the Custodian to withdraw from the Digital Asset Account ZEC, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust Expenses and (ii) may either (x) cause the Trust (or its delegate) to convert such ZEC, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency into U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies at the Actual Exchange Rate or (y) when the Sponsor incurs such expenses on behalf of the Trust, cause the Trust (or its delegate) to deliver such ZEC, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency in kind to the Sponsor, in each case in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust Expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Trust incurred Sponsor s Fees of and , respectively.

In addition, the Sponsor may pay Additional Trust Expenses on behalf of the Trust, which are reimbursable by the Trust to the Sponsor. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Sponsor did t pay any Additional Trust Expenses on behalf of the Trust. On March 2, 2022, the Board of the Sponsor (the Board approved the purchase by DCG, the indirect parent company of the Sponsor, of up to million worth of Shares of the Trust.

From March 2, 2022 through June 30, 2022, DCG purchased million worth of Shares of the Trust. From July 1, 2022 through September 30, 2024 , DCG had t purchased any Shares of the Trust under this authorization.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our unaudited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP ). The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report, or in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements or other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Trust Overview 
 The Trust is a passive entity that is managed and administered by the Sponsor and does not have any officers, directors or employees. The Trust holds ZEC and, from time to time on a periodic basis, issues Creation Baskets in exchange for deposits of ZEC. As a passive investment vehicle, the Trust s investment objective is for the value of the Shares (based on ZEC per Share) to reflect the value of ZEC held by the Trust, determined by reference to the Index Price, less the Trust s expenses and other liabilities. While an investment in the Shares is not a direct investment in ZEC, the Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to gain investment exposure to ZEC. To date, the Trust has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of ZEC held by the Trust, less the Trust s expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, which at times have been substantial. The Trust is not managed like a business corporation or an active investment vehicle. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Investment Transactions and Revenue Recognition 
 The Trust considers investment transactions to be the receipt of ZEC for Share creations and the delivery of ZEC for Share redemptions or for payment of expenses in ZEC. At this time, the Trust is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders. The Trust records its investment transactions on a trade date basis and changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. Realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with transactions including settling obligations for the Sponsor s Fee in ZEC. 
 Principal Market and Fair Value Determination 
 To determine which market is the Trust s principal market (or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market) for purposes of calculating the Trust s net asset value in accordance with U.S. GAAP Principal Market NAV ), the Trust follows Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurement , which outlines the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for ZEC in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Trust to assume that ZEC is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact.
 
 The Trust only receives ZEC in connection with a creation order from the Authorized Participant (or a Liquidity Provider) and does not itself transact on any Digital Asset Markets. Therefore, the Trust looks to market-based volume and level of activity for Digital Asset Markets. The Authorized Participant(s), or a Liquidity Provider, may transact in a Brokered Market, a Dealer Market, Principal-to-Principal Markets and Exchange Markets (referred to as Trading Platform Markets in this Quarterly Report), each as defined in the FASB ASC Master Glossary (collectively, Digital Asset Markets ). 
 In determining which of the eligible Digital Asset Markets is the Trust s principal market, the Trust reviews these criteria in the following order: 
 First, the Trust reviews a list of Digital Asset Markets that maintain practices and policies designed to comply with anti-money laundering AML and know-your-customer KYC regulations, and non-Digital Asset Trading Platform Markets that the Trust reasonably believes are operating in compliance with applicable law, including federal and state licensing requirements, based upon information and assurances provided to it by each market. 

Second, the Trust sorts these Digital Asset Markets from high to low by market-based volume and level of activity of ZEC traded on each Digital Asset Market in the trailing twelve months. 

Third, the Trust then reviews pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on Digital Asset Markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular Digital Asset Market. 

15 

Fourth, the Trust then selects a Digital Asset Market as its principal market based on the highest market-based volume, level of activity and price stability in comparison to the other Digital Asset Markets on the list. Based on information reasonably available to the Trust, Trading Platform Markets have the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. The Trust therefore looks to accessible Trading Platform Markets as opposed to the Brokered Market, Dealer Market and Principal-to-Principal Markets to determine its principal market. As a result of the aforementioned analysis, a Trading Platform Market has been selected as the Trust s principal market. 

The Trust determines its principal market (or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine (i) if there have been recent changes to each Digital Asset Market s trading volume and level of activity in the trailing twelve months, (ii) if any Digital Asset Markets have developed that the Trust has access to, or (iii) if recent changes to each Digital Asset Market s price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the Trust s determination of its principal market. 
 The cost basis of ZEC received in connection with a creation order is recorded by the Trust at the fair value of ZEC at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the creation date for financial reporting purposes. The cost basis recorded by the Trust may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of the corresponding Shares to investors. 
 Investment Company Considerations 
 The Trust is an investment company for U.S. GAAP purposes and follows accounting and reporting guidance in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies . The Trust uses fair value as its method of accounting for ZEC in accordance with its classification as an investment company for accounting purposes. The Trust is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and these differences could be material.

Net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 177 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized gain on investment in ZEC, less the Sponsor s Fee of 180. Net assets increased to 10,769 at September 30, 2024, a 20 increase for the nine-month period. The increase in net assets resulted from the aforementioned ZEC price appreciation and the contribution of approximately 67,080 ZEC with a value of 1,631 to the Trust in connection with Share creations during the period, partially offset by the withdrawal of approximately 6,636 ZEC to pay the foregoing Sponsor s Fee.

The decrease in net assets resulted from the aforementioned ZEC price depreciation and the withdrawal of approximately 6,147 ZEC to pay the foregoing Sponsor s Fee. 
 Cash Resources and Liquidity 
 The Trust has not had a cash balance at any time since inception. When selling ZEC, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency in the Digital Asset Market to pay Additional Trust Expenses on behalf of the Trust, the Sponsor endeavors to sell the exact amount of ZEC, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than ZEC. As a consequence, the Sponsor expects that the Trust will not record any cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period. Furthermore, the Trust is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report was the Sponsor s Fee. The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs.
