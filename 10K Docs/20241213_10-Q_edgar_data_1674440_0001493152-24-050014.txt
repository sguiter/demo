CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION 

This
quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act ). The words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, 
 estimate, may, should, could, will, plan, future, 
 continue, and other expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and that do not relate to
historical matters identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations or forecasts
of future events, can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, and are subject to various business risks and known and unknown uncertainties,
a number of which are beyond our control. Therefore, actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained
in this document, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation
to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A wide
variety of factors could cause or contribute to such differences and could adversely impact revenues, profitability, cash flows and capital
needs. There can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this document will, in fact, transpire or prove to
be accurate. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the
risks in the section entitled Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, filed on July 25,
2024, that may cause our or our industry s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different
from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. 

Important
factors that may cause the actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements, projections or other expectations include, but
are not limited to, the following: 

risk
 that we will not be able to remediate identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure
 controls and procedures; 

risk
 that we fail to meet the requirements of the agreements under which we acquired our business interests, including any cash payments
 to the business operations, which could result in the loss of our right to continue to operate or develop the specific businesses
 described in the agreements; 

risk
 that we will be unable to secure additional financing in the near future in order to commence and sustain our planned development
 and growth plans; 

risk
 that we cannot attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, particularly employees, consultants and contractors for our operations; 

risks
 and uncertainties relating to the various industries and operations we are currently engaged in; 

results
 of initial feasibility, pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, and the possibility that future growth, development or expansion
 will not be consistent with our expectations; 

risks
 related to the inherent uncertainty of business operations including profit, cost of goods, production costs and cost estimates and
 the potential for unexpected costs and expenses; 

risks
 related to commodity price fluctuations; 

the
 uncertainty of profitability based upon our history of losses; 

risks
 related to failure to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis and on acceptable terms for our planned development projects; 

risks
 related to environmental regulation and liability; 

risks
 related to tax assessments; and 

other
 risks and uncertainties related to our prospects, properties and business strategy. 

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels
of activity, performance or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as
of the date of this report. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements
to conform these statements to actual results, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

As
used in this quarterly report, the Connexa, Company, we, us, or our 
refer to Connexa Sports Technologies Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated.

otherwise indicated, all share numbers and per share totals have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-40 reverse stock split that was effective

Basis

and Gameface for the periods ended October 31, 2024 and 2023. 

Impact
of COVID-19 Pandemic 

The
Company continues to carefully monitor the global COVID-19 pandemic status and its impact on its business. In that regard, while the
Company has continued to sell its products it has previously experienced certain minor disruptions in its supply chains. The Company
expects the significance of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of its effect on the Company s financial and operational
results, to be dictated by, among other things, the on-going global efforts to contain it. While the Company has not experienced any
material disruptions to its business and operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible such disruptions may occur in
the future which may impact its financial and operational results, and which could be material. 

Impact
of Russian and Ukrainian Conflict 

In
February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. We are closely monitoring
the unfolding events due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its regional and global ramifications. We have one distributor in Russia,
which is not material to our overall financial results. We do not currently have operations in Ukraine or Belarus. We are monitoring
any broader economic impact from the current crisis. The specific impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations,
and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. However, to the extent that such military action
spreads to other countries, intensifies, or otherwise remains active, such action could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Impact
of Israel and Hamas Conflict 

Because
we develop products in Israel and our chief marketing officer is located in Israel, our business and operations are directly affected
by economic, political, geopolitical and military conditions affecting Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948,
a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its neighboring countries and other hostile non-state actors. These conflicts
have involved missile strikes, hostile infiltrations and terrorism against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, which have negatively
affected business conditions in Israel. 

On
October 7, 2023, Hamas militants and members of other terrorist organizations infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza
Strip and conducted a series of terror attacks on civilian and military targets. Thereafter, these terrorists launched extensive rocket
attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip. As of October 7, 2023,
such attacks collectively resulted in over 1,478 deaths and over 5,400 injured people, in addition to the kidnapping of a currently indefinite
number of civilians, including women and children. Shortly following the attack, Israel s security cabinet declared war against
Hamas. 

The
intensity and duration of Israel s current war against Hamas is difficult to predict, and as are such war s economic implications
on the Company s business and operations and on Israel s economy in general. On October 9, 2023, . These events
may imply wider macroeconomic indications of a deterioration of Israel s economic standing, which may have a material adverse effect
on the Company and its ability to effectively conduct is business, operations and affairs. 

On
July 31, 2024, Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in Tehran, Iran, which, although not commented on or confirmed by Israel,
is largely believed to be attributable to Israel. On July 31, 2024, Israel killed Fouad Shukur, a Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and
on October 16, 2024, Israel killed Yahya Al-Sinwar, the leader of Hamas. In the Gaza Strip. These actions have caused both Iran and Hezbollah
to threaten to retaliate against Israel (although to-date, no retaliatory actions have been confirmed). 

It
is possible that other terrorist organizations will join the hostilities as well, including Palestinian military organizations in the
West Bank. In the event that hostilities disrupt the development of our products, our ability to deliver products to customers in a timely
manner to meet our contractual obligations with customers and vendors could be materially and adversely affected. 

Our
commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with war and terrorism. Although the Israeli
government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot
assure you that this government coverage will be maintained or that it will sufficiently cover our potential damages. Any losses or damages
incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

As
a result of the Israeli security cabinet s decision to declare war against Hamas, several hundred thousand Israeli reservists were
drafted to perform immediate military service. If any of our employees and consultants in Israel are called for service in the current
war with Hamas, our operations may be disrupted by such absences, which may materially and adversely affect our business and results
of operations. Additionally, the absence of employees of our Israeli suppliers and contract manufacturers due to their military service
in the current war or future wars or other armed conflicts may disrupt their operations, in which event our ability to deliver products
to customers may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, popular uprisings in various countries in the Middle East and North
Africa have affected the political stability of those countries. Such instability may lead to a deterioration in the political and trade
relationships that exist between the State of Israel and these countries, such as Turkey. Moreover, some countries around the world restrict
doing business with Israel and Israeli companies, and additional countries may impose restrictions on doing business with Israel and
Israeli companies if hostilities in Israel or political instability in the region continues or increases. These restrictions may limit
materially our ability to obtain raw materials from these countries or sell our products to companies and customers in these countries.
In addition, there have been increased efforts by activists to cause companies and consumers to boycott Israeli goods. Such efforts,
particularly if they become more widespread, may materially and adversely impact our ability to sell our products outside of Israel. 

Prior
to the Hamas attack in October 2023, the Israeli government pursued extensive changes to Israel s judicial system, which sparked
extensive political debate and unrest. In response to such initiative, many individuals, organizations and institutions, both within
and outside of Israel, have voiced concerns that the proposed changes may negatively impact the business environment in Israel including
due to reluctance of foreign investors to invest or transact business in Israel as well as to increased currency fluctuations, downgrades
in credit rating, increased interest rates, increased volatility in security markets, and other changes in macroeconomic conditions.
The risk of such negative developments has increased in light of the recent Hamas attacks and the war against Hamas declared by Israel.
To the extent that any of these negative developments do occur, they may have an adverse effect on our business, our results of operations
and our ability to raise additional funds, if deemed necessary by our management and board of directors. 

as of October 31, 2024, and more losses are anticipated in the development of the business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related
to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the results of the Company post-merger as discussed in Note 13,
generating profitable operations in the future and/or being able to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the
next twelve months with existing cash on hand, revenue from operations, and/or private or public placement of debt and/or common
stock. In the event that the Company is unable to successfully raise capital and/or generate revenues, the Company will likely
reduce general and administrative expenses, and cease or delay its development plan until it is able to obtain sufficient financing.
The Company has reduced operating expenses and cash outflows by selling PlaySight, as well as selling 
of Foundation Sports in November and December 2022, respectively to the former shareholders of those companies. There can be no
assurance that additional funds will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. We have recorded the 
investment in Foundation Sports at .

Step
2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract 

The
Company s customers are buying an integrated system. In evaluating whether the equipment is a separate performance obligation,
the Company s management considered the customer s ability to benefit from the equipment on its own or together with other
readily available resources and if so, whether the service and equipment are separately identifiable (i.e., is the service highly dependent
on, or highly interrelated with the equipment). Because the Products and Services included in the customer s contract are integrated
and highly interdependent, and because they must work together to deliver the Solution, the Company has concluded that Products installed
on customer s premise and Services contracted for by the customer are generally not distinct within the context of the contract
and, therefore, constitute a single, combined performance obligation. 

Step
3: Determine the transaction price 

The
transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods
or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer includes predetermined fixed amounts, variable amounts,
or both. The Company s contracts do not include any rights of returns or refunds. 

The
Company collects each year s service fees in advance and should therefore consider the existence of a significant financing component.
However, due to the fact that the payments are provided for the service of a one-year term, the Company elected to apply the practical
expedient under ASC 606 which exempts the adjustment of the consideration for the existence of a significant financing component when
the period between the transfer of the services and the payment for such services is one year or less. 

Step
4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

Contracts
that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on
each performance obligation s relative standalone selling price SSP ). The Company has identified a single performance
obligation in the contract, and therefore, the allocation provisions under ASC 606 do not apply to the Company s contracts. 

Step
5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation 

Revenues
for the Company s single, combined performance obligation are recognized on a straight-line basis over the customer s contract
term, which is the period in which the parties to the contract have enforceable rights and obligations (Typically 3-4 years).

In
December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU ), 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ,
which amends ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). This update is intended to simplify accounting for income taxes by removing certain
exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and amending existing guidance to improve consistent application of ASC 740. This update
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The guidance in this update has various elements, some of which are
applied on a prospective basis and others on a retrospective basis with earlier application permitted. The adoption of the new standard
did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and
Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s
Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 will simplify the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible
debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models results in fewer embedded conversion features being
separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current GAAP. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation
models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition
of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting and (2) convertible debt instruments issued
with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. ASU 2020-06 also amends the guidance for the derivatives
scope exception for contracts in an entity s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. ASU 2020-06
will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2020-06 will have on the Company s
consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures. 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments ASC 326 ). The guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred
to as the current expected credit loss CECL methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology
is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also
applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credits, financial
guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases.
ASC 326 requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as
the credit quality and underwriting standards of a company s portfolio. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for
available-for-sale debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down
on available-for-sale debt securities the Company does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not they will be required
to sell. The ASU can be adopted no later than January 1, 2020 for SEC filers and January 1, 2023 for private companies and smaller reporting
companies. The adoption of the new standard did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In
October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
(Topic 805) . The amendments in this Update address diversity and inconsistency related to the recognition and measurement of contract
assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. The amendments in this Update require that an acquirer recognize
and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. The adoption of the new standard did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

The
FASB has issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation Stock
Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). ASU 2021-04 provides
guidance that an entity should treat a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written
call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument.
The standard also provides guidance on how an entity should measure and recognize the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding
equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption
of the new standard did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Other
recently issued accounting pronouncements did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material effect on the Company s

the Reverse Stock Split, the aggregate number of pre-funded warrants, 5-Year Warrants, 5.5-Year Warrants and 7-Year Warrants increased
from 1,709,097 to 9,426,952 due to certain adjustments that were required to be made by the terms of the relevant warrants in the event
of receipt of shareholder approval and the occurrence of the Reverse Stock Split. 

On
October 12, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the Bylaws of the Company to reduce the percentage of
shares of stock, issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, to be present in person or represented by proxy in order to constitute
a quorum for the transaction of any business from a majority to thirty three and one third percent (33 1/3 ).

Shares and (b) 1,575,470 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants and on August 21, 2024 such registration

the engagement of Bush Associates CPA B A as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm
for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025, effective immediately, and dismissed Olayinka Oyebola Co OOC as the Company s
independent registered public accounting firm. 

Until
B A was engaged on October 31, 2024, OOC was the Company s auditor and had audited the Company s consolidated financial
statements for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2023 and 2024. 

The
reason for the dismissal of OOC and the engagement of B A is that due to the charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC against OOC for allegedly aiding and abetting a securities fraud, the risk of continuing with OOC
as the Company s auditor is no longer tolerable to the Company. 

OOC s
reports on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023 did not contain an adverse
opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, other
than an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

During
the course of OOC s engagement there were no disagreements with OOC on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope and procedures which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of OOC, would have caused OOC to make
reference to the matter in its audit opinion. There were no reportable events (as that term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation
S-K) during the period OOC was engaged as the Company s auditor. 

OOC
and its principal, Olayinka Oyebola, have been charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC in connection
with allegedly aiding and abetting a securities fraud. For more information regarding recent developments related to OOC, see Risk
Factors-Our former independent auditor, Olayinka Oyebola Co. and its principal have been charged by the SEC in connection with
securities fraud allegations.

Net
sales 

Net
sales decreased 1.93 million, or -84 , during the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended October
31, 2023. The decrease was as a direct result of on-going inventory availability issues stemming back to the start of calendar 2024.
The company had zero Tennis Launcher inventory (its primary revenue driver) available for sale through our e-commerce platform in North
America nor to any of our international distributor-managed markets throughout the Quarter ended October 31, 2024. The majority of revenues
generated within the quarter came from our limited D2C Pickleball Launcher inventory within North America. 

Cost
of sales and Gross income 

Cost
of sales decreased 1.21 million or -74 during the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended October
31, 2023, which is directly as a result of the decrease in net sales. Gross income decreased 0.72 million, or -111 , during the
three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023. This reduction in gross income is driven
primarily as a result of the net sales reduction. 

Selling
and marketing expenses 

Selling
and marketing expenses decreased 0.71 million, or -56 , during the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the three
months ended October 31, 2023. This decrease is a direct result of the reduction in net sales and the associated ceasing of all Tennis
and Pickleball product related marketing activities.

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses, which primarily consist of compensation) and other employee-related costs, as well as legal fees and fees
for professional services, decreased 0.45 million or -28 during the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the three months
ended October 31, 2023. This decrease is primarily driven by the annual company insurance policies becoming due as well as the on-going
legal and other professional fees related to the acquisition of. 

Loss
From Operations 

Loss
from operations increased by 0.9 million or 7 in the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended October
31, 2023. This increase in loss in operations was driven by a combination of an 0.72 million decrease in gross profit offset by a reduction
of 0.63 million in total operating expense reductions recorded in the quarter. 

Other
expense 

Total
other expense decreased 3.03 million or 100 during the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended October
31, 2023. We recorded changes in the change in fair value of derivative liability of 14.80 million, amortization of debt discounts of
 0.01 million and 0.35 million in interest expense. Excluding these improvements, we recorded an increase in derivative expense of 11.40
million, and 0.35 million for the periods to October 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, a decrease in non-operating income of 3.03 million
or 100 .

Net
sales 

Net
sales decreased 4.35 million, or -80 , during the six months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the six months ended October 31,
2023. The decrease was as a direct result of on-going inventory availability issues stemming back to the start of calendar 2024. The
company had limited Tennis Launcher inventory (its primary revenue driver) available for sale through our e-commerce platform in North
America nor inventory to sell to any of our international distributor-managed markets throughout the six month ended October 31, 2024.
The majority of revenues generated within the six months to October 31, 2024 came from our limited D2C Pickleball Launcher inventory
within North America. 

Cost
of sales and Gross income 

Cost
of sales decreased 3.01 million or -78 during the six months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the six months ended October
31, 2023, which is directly as a result of the decrease in net sales. Gross income decreased 1.34 million, or -87 , during the
six months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the six months ended October 31, 2023. This reduction in gross income is driven primarily
as a result of the net sales reduction. 

Selling
and marketing expenses 

Selling
and marketing expenses decreased 0.28 million, or -49 , during the six months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the six months
ended October 31, 2023. This decrease is a direct result of the reduction in net sales and the associated ceasing of all Tennis product
related marketing activities.

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses, which primarily consist of compensation) and other employee-related costs, as well as legal fees and fees
for professional services, increased 0.42 million or 10 during the six months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the six months
ended October 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in debt settlement, the annual company insurance policies
becoming due for renewal and the on-going legal and other professional fees related to the acquisition of YYEM and management of the
company s Nasdaq compliance within the period. 

Loss
From Operations 

Loss
from operations increased by 1.45 million or 48 in the six months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the six months ended October
31, 2023. This increase in loss in operations was driven by a combination of an 1.50 million increase in total operating expenses recorded
in the quarter, coupled with a reduced in gross profit of 1.34 million. 

Other
expense 

Total
other expense increased 5.01 million or 124 during the six months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the six months ended October
31, 2023. We recorded an improvement in both amortization of debt discounts of 0.79 million; in loss on conversion of accounts payable
to common stock of 0.29 million; in fair value of derivatives of 16.94 million. Excluding these improvements, we recorded an increase
in interest expense of 0.55 million for the periods to October 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, an increase of 130 . 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our
liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. We had an accumulated deficit of (172,973,917) as of October
31, 2024. 

The
following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the six months ended October 31, 2024
and 2023:

We
had cash and cash equivalents of 1,642,969 as of October 31, 2024, as compared to 229,705 as of April 30, 2024. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 2,726 during the six months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to net cash used in operating
activities of (648,056) during the same period in 2023. Our net cash used in operating activities during the six months ended October
31, 2024 was primarily the result of our net loss of (5,586,889) for the period, and our net non-cash expenses of 2,496,748,
incorporating the change in fair value of derivative liability, increases in shares and warrants issued for services, share-based compensation,
amortization of debt discounts, interest and interest due to related parties, settlement expense, loss on depreciation, amortization
and impairment expenses, as well as changes in our current assets and liabilities related to our operations. The most notable changes
occurred in our decreased levels of inventory for the six month periods, together with decreases in accounts payable, derivative liabilities,
contingent consideration, amortization, fair value changes in our derivative liability, amortization of debt discounts, settlement expense
and loss on settlement of accounts payable. These were offset with increases in accounts receivable, accrued interest, prepaid inventory,
accrued expenses - both across accounts payable and payroll costs. 

We
incurred no investing activities in either of the six-month periods ended October 31, 2024 and 2023.

Net
cash used in financing activities was 1,546,328 for the six months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to net cash provided by financing
activities of 654,479 for the same period in 2023. The changes in financing activities for the six months ended October 31, 2024 primarily
consisted of proceeds of 1,618,996 resulting from the exercise of warrants, and 72,668 in payments of notes payable. Changes in financing
activities for the six months ended October 31, 2023 consisted of 1,276,000 in proceeds from notes payable, offset by payments of 556,025
in related party notes payable and 65.496 in notes payable. 

Description
of Indebtedness 

Notes
Payable Related Party 

On
January 14, 2022, the Company entered into two loan agreements with Yonah Kalfa and Naftali Kalfa, each for 1,000,000, pursuant to which
the Company received a total amount of 2,000,000. The loans bear interest at a rate of 0 per annum and are required to be repaid in
full by July 31, 2024 or such other date as may be accepted by the lenders. The Company is not permitted to make any distribution or
pay any dividends unless or until the loans are repaid in full. The company has subsequently agreed with the lenders to extend the repayment
deadline to Jully 31, 2025. 

There
were 1,169,291 and 1,169,291 in outstanding borrowings under these loan agreements from the Company s related parties for
the period ended October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. Accrued interest due to related parties as of October 31, 2024
and April 30, 2024 amounted to 917,957 and 917,957, respectively. 

On
January 6, 2023, we sold certain of our inventory including all components, parts, additions and accessions thereto to Yonah Kalfa and
Naftali Kalfa who immediately consigned it back to us in exchange for a payment of 103 per ball launcher we sell until we have paid
them an aggregate total of 2,092,700, which represents payment in full of the principal amounts of the related-party loan agreements
and certain other expenses they incurred in connection with the Company. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Effect
of Inflation and Changes in Prices 

We
do not believe that inflation and changes in prices will have a material effect on our operations. 

Going
Concern 

Our
former independent registered public accounting firm auditors report accompanying our April 30, 2024 financial statements contained
an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have
been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities
and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide disclosure about market risk. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as the Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company s disclosure
controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under Exchange Act 13a-15, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by this report. 

Based
upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of October 31, 2024, due to the material weaknesses that were identified and listed below. 

In
connection with our management s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting
during the year ended April 30, 2024, we identified the following material weaknesses: 

The
 Company lacked adequate segregation of duties due to the small size of the organization. 

The
 Company lacked a chief financial officer and personnel with experience and expertise in public
 company accounting and internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in the Company s control over financial reporting since July 31, 2024.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

We
know of no pending proceedings to which any director, member of senior management, or affiliate is either a party adverse to us or has
a material interest adverse to us. 

None
of our executive officers or directors have (i) been involved in any bankruptcy proceedings within the last five years, (ii) been convicted
in or has pending any criminal proceedings (other than traffic violations and other minor offenses), (iii) been subject to any order,
judgment or decree enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activity
or (iv) been found to have violated any Federal, state or provincial securities or commodities law and such finding has not been reversed,
suspended or vacated. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

There
have been no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended April 30, 2024. Risk factors in respect of YYEM are set forth below: 

Risks
Related to the Acquisition 

The
market price of our Common Stock will continue to fluctuate. 

The
market price of our Common Stock will continue to fluctuate, potentially significantly, as a result of a variety of factors, including,
among others, general market and economic conditions, and changes in our business, operations and prospects, in interest rates, in general
market, industry and economic conditions and in other factors generally affecting stock prices, federal, state and local legislation,
governmental regulation and legal developments in the industry segments in which we will operate. Our market capitalization and trading
volume may contribute to greater volatility. In addition, any significant price or volume fluctuations in the stock market generally
could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. 

11 

Following
the Acquisition, our stockholders will have a significantly lower ownership and voting interest in us than they currently have in Connexa
and will exercise less influence over management and policies of Connexa. 

Based
on the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on December 13, 2024, stockholders of the Company
owned approximately 44.2 of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock and the YYEM shareholder owned approximately 55.8 
of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. Consequently, the YYEM Seller is able to exert significant influence over certain
matters, including matters that must be resolved by a general meeting of shareholders, such as the election of members to the board of
directors or the declaration of dividends or other distributions. To the extent that the interest of this shareholder may differ from
the interests of the Company s other shareholders, the Company s other shareholders may be disadvantaged by any actions that
this shareholder may seek to pursue. Additionally, stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Acquisition commensurate with the
ownership dilution they experienced in connection with that transaction. 

A
market for our Common Stock may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our Common Stock. 

Following
the Acquisition, the market price of our Common Stock may continue to fluctuate significantly due to the market s reaction to the
Acquisition and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our Common Stock following the Acquisition may never
develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the market price of our Common Stock after the Acquisition may vary due
to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports. Additionally,
if our Common Stock becomes delisted from Nasdaq for any reason and is relegated to the OTC Bulletin Board (an inter-dealer automated
quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange), the liquidity and price of our Common Stock will
be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your shares
of Common Stock unless a market for our Common Stock can be established or sustained. 

Although
we expect that our Common Stock will remain listed on Nasdaq, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued
listing standards of Nasdaq. 

On
several occasions in the past, we have failed to comply with Nasdaq s listing rules. We cannot assure you that we will be able
to meet Nasdaq s continued listing standards, and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to satisfy the initial listing
requirements. 

If
Nasdaq delists our Common Stock due to our failure to meet its continued listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant
material adverse consequences including: 

a
 limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

a
 determination that our Common Stock is a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to
 more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares; 

a
 limited amount of analyst coverage and more limited universe of potential investors in our securities; and 

a
 decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

12 

Following
the Acquisition, the price of our Common Stock may continue to be especially volatile, and if the Acquisition s benefits do not
meet the expectations of investors, stockholders, or financial analysts, the market price of our Common Stock may decline. 

Prior
to the Acquisition, there was no public market for YYEM s securities. Accordingly, the valuation ascribed to YYEM and our Common
Stock in the Acquisition might not have been indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market following the Acquisition.
If an active market for our Common Stock continues, the trading price could be especially volatile, and fluctuations in the price of
our Common Stock could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. For the period following the Acquisition and beyond,
our stock price may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the
factors listed below, among others, could have a material adverse effect on your investment, and our Common Stock may trade at prices
significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our Common Stock may not recover and may
experience a further decline. 

If
the benefits of the Acquisition, and the performance of the Company more broadly, do not meet the expectations of investors or securities
analysts, the market price of our Common Stock may decline. Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of
our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and Nasdaq in particular, have experienced price
and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected.
The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the
market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price
regardless of our business, prospects, financial condition, or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities
also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. 

YYEM
may not realize anticipated growth opportunities. 

We
expect that YYEM will realize growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the Acquisition, although
we cannot predict with certainty if or when these growth opportunities and benefits will occur, or the extent to which they actually
will be achieved. For example, the benefits from the Acquisition may be offset by costs incurred in connection with the Acquisition,
or as a result of being part of a public company. 

Risks
Related to Our Business, Operations, Industry, Legal and Regulatory Requirements 

References
in this section to we, us, our, YYEM and the company refer to YYEM
giving effect to the Acquisition. 

We
are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our revenue through intellectual property licensing agreements, and we may
not realize the expected benefits of such arrangements. 

We
have in the past entered into, and may continue to enter into, licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will commercialize
our intellectual property and bolster our revenue. 

Our
revenue from licensing agreements increased significantly in the year ended January 31, 2024 and increased further in the three-month
period ended April 30, 2024, constituting substantially all of our revenue, and our results of operations have been, and may continue
to be, affected by such arrangements. Licensing agreements involving our intellectual property are subject to various risks. Our licensees
may fail to comply with their obligations set out in the respective agreements. If the licensees generate insufficient revenue from their
operations, they may be unable to meet the minimum payments required under the agreements. Our licensees may elect to cease the licensing
arrangements due to a change in their strategic focus, the availability of funding, or other external factors. Termination of any licensing
arrangements may result in a reduction in our revenue and the need for replacement arrangements with other licensees. 

Our
licensees have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to their own operations, potentially
resulting in less revenue than we anticipate at the outset of the relationship. Such licensees may independently develop intellectual
property that could substitute for ours or may partner with competitors offering different technology. 

13 

Our
licensees may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information
in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property rights or our
rights over our proprietary information or could expose us to potential liability. 

Disputes
may arise between us and our licensees that interfere with the licensing arrangements or lead to the termination of the licensing agreements.
Such disputes could result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources. 

As
we expand to new jurisdictions, if we fail to enter into licensing arrangements for a particular territory with a suitable strategic
partner and do not have sufficient funds or local expertise to undertake the necessary commercialization activities ourselves, we may
not be able to generate revenue from such territory. 

For
these and other reasons, we may not achieve the outcomes expected from our licensing arrangements. These arrangements are subject to
significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and are beyond
our control. We may face operational and financial risks including increases in near- and long-term expenditure, exposure to unknown
liabilities, disruption of our business, and diversion of our management s time and attention. Even if we achieve the expected
benefits, we may not be able to do so within the anticipated time frame. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

The
love and marriage market sector, including matchmaking apps, is competitive, with low switching costs and a consistent stream of new
services and entrants, and innovation by competitors may disrupt our business. 

The
love and marriage market sector, including matchmaking apps, is competitive, with a consistent stream of new services and entrants.
Some of our competitors and the competitors of our licensees may enjoy better competitive positions in certain geographical regions,
user demographics, or other key areas that we or our licensees currently serve or may serve in the future. These advantages could
enable such competitors to offer services that are more appealing to users and potential users than the services offered by us or
our licensees or to respond more quickly or cost-effectively than us or our licensees to new or changing opportunities. 

In
addition, within the love and marriage market sector generally, costs for consumers to switch between services are low, and
consumers have a propensity to try new approaches to connecting with people and to use multiple services at the same time. As a
result, new services, entrants, and business models are likely to continue to emerge. If we or a licensee become established as a
dominant player in any particular market, it is possible that a new service could gain rapid scale at the expense of existing brands
by harnessing a new technology, such as generative AI, or a new or existing distribution channel, creating a new or different
approach to connecting people, or some other means. We may need to respond by introducing new services or features (for us or for
our licensees), and we may not be successful in that. If we do not sufficiently innovate to provide new services, or improve upon
existing services, that users or prospective users find appealing, we or our licensees may be unable to continue to attract new
users or continue to appeal to existing users. 

Potential
competitors include larger companies that could devote greater resources to the promotion or marketing of their services, take
advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities more readily, or develop and expand their services more quickly than we or our
licensees do. Potential competitors also include established social media companies that may develop features or services that
compete with ours or our licensees or operators of mobile operating systems and app stores. For example, Facebook offers a
dating feature on its platform, which it rolled out globally several years ago and has grown dramatically in size supported by
Facebook s massive worldwide user footprint. These social media and mobile platform competitors could use strong or dominant
positions in one or more markets, coupled with ready access to existing large pools of potential users and personal information
regarding those users, to gain competitive advantages over us or our licensees, including by offering different features or services that users may
prefer or offering their services to users at no charge, which may enable them to acquire and engage users at the expense of our
user growth or engagement. 

If
we are not able to compete effectively against current or future competitors as well as other services that may emerge, or if our decisions
regarding where to focus our investments are not successful in the long term, the size and level of engagement of our user base may decrease,
which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If, similarly, our licensees are
unable to compete effectively or are unsuccessful in this regard, the size and level of engagement of their user base may decrease, which
could impact their payments to us and therefore have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

14 

The
limited operating history and geographic reach of YYEM s brands and services makes it difficult to evaluate our current business
and future prospects. 

We
seek to tailor our services to meet the preferences of specific geographies, demographics, and other communities of users. Building a
given brand or service is generally an iterative process that occurs over a meaningful period of time and involves considerable resources
and expenditure. The historical growth rate of any brand or service may not be indicative of future growth rates for the brand or service
or for brands and services that we may launch in other jurisdictions. We may encounter risks and difficulties as we build our brands
and services. The failure to successfully scale these brands and services and address these risks and difficulties could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

If our licensees fail to add users (or if we fail to do so after developing our own offerings for end users), our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed. 

Our
financial performance will be significantly determined by our licensees success in adding and retaining users of their
services (or our ability to do so if we develop our own offerings for end users). Currently, the size of our licensees user
base is impacted by a number of factors, including competing products and services and global and regional business, macroeconomic,
and geopolitical conditions. 

If
people do not perceive our licensees services to be useful, the licensees may not be able to attract or retain users. With
each new generation of users, expectations of matchmaking and dating services change and user behaviors and priorities shift. As a
result, we may need to further leverage our existing capabilities or advances in technologies such as artificial intelligence AI and those relating to the metaverse, or adopt new technologies, to improve our licensees existing services
or introduce new services in order to better satisfy existing users and to expand our licensees penetration of what continues
to be a large available new-user market. However, there can be no assurance that further implementation of technologies such as AI
and those relating to the metaverse will enhance our licensees services or be beneficial to our business, and the
introduction of new features or services to their existing services may have unintended consequences for their ecosystem, which could
lead to fluctuations in the size of their user base. 

If
our licensees are unable to maintain or increase the size of their user base (or if we are unable to do so), our revenue and other
financial results may be adversely affected. Furthermore, as the size of our licensees user base fluctuates in one or more
markets from time to time, we may become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of monetization in
order to grow our revenue. Any significant decrease in user retention or growth could render our licensees services less
attractive to users, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations. 

If
we develop our own offerings for end users, our growth and profitability will rely, in significant part, on our ability to attract and
retain users through cost-effective marketing efforts. Any failure in those efforts could adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. 

Attracting
and retaining users for any services we develop for end users will involve considerable expenditure for online and offline
marketing, likely requiring higher marketing outlays over time in order to sustain our growth. This also applies to our licensees,
whose success is a key component of our own. Evolving consumer behavior can affect the availability of profitable marketing
opportunities. Offline campaigns may diminish in effectiveness as consumers move increasingly online. Online campaigns may become
less fruitful as large tech platforms, such as Apple and Google, increasingly limit advertisers ability to access and use
unique advertising identifiers, cookies, and other information to acquire potential users (such as Apple s rules regarding the
collection and use of identifiers for advertising, often referred to as IDFA). To continue to reach potential users and grow our
businesses after developing our own offerings for end users, we will likely be required to identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditure to newer advertising
channels, such as social media and online video platforms. We could have less success using these newer advertising channels and
methods to identify potential customers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to appropriately manage our marketing
efforts in response to these and other trends in the advertising industry. Any failure to do so could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 

15 

Distribution
and marketing of, and access to, the online services offered by us and our licensees may rely, in significant part, on a variety of third-party
platforms, in particular, mobile app stores. If these third parties limit, prohibit, or otherwise interfere with features or services
or change their policies in any material way, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We
may market and distribute our online services (including our AI matchmaker application) through a variety of third-party
distribution channels, some of which may limit or prohibit advertisements for services such as ours, whether because they decide to
launch competing offerings in the same industry or because they are reacting to poor behavior by other industry participants, or for
some other reason. Furthermore, certain platforms on which we may market our services may not properly monitor or ensure the quality
of content located adjacent to or near our advertisements on such platforms, which could have a negative effect on consumers 
perceptions of our company. The same issues apply to our licensees distribution channels and the platforms on which they may market their
services. Any of these developments could rise to a level where our business, financial condition, and results of
operations are adversely affected. 

Additionally,
our mobile applications and those of our licensees will be most often accessed through the Apple App Store and Google Play
Store. Both Apple and Google have broad discretion to change their policies regarding their mobile operating systems and app stores
in ways that may limit, eliminate, or otherwise interfere with a company s ability to distribute or promote its applications through their
stores, its ability to update its applications, and its ability to access information that the apps collect about users. To the
extent either Apple or Google does so, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

The
success of our services for end users, and those of our licensees, will depend in part on our ability, or our licensees ability, to access, collect, and use personal data about users
and subscribers. 

We
and our licensees may rely extensively on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, as well as other technology platforms, to
distribute and monetize our mobile applications. Users and subscribers will pay through these platforms, which will prevent us or
our licensees from accessing key user data that we or they would otherwise receive if the transaction were with the users and
subscribers directly. This could negatively impact customer relationship management efforts, the ability to reach new segments of
our respective user and subscriber bases and the population generally, the efficiency of paid marketing efforts, the rates we or our
licensees are able to charge advertisers seeking to reach users and subscribers of our respective services, our ability to comply
with applicable law, and our ability, and our licensees ability, to identify and exclude users and subscribers whose access would violate applicable terms and
conditions, including underage individuals and bad actors, all of which could cause our business, financial condition, and results
of operations to be adversely affected. 

As
the distribution of our online services through app stores increases, in order to maintain our profit margins, we may need to take steps
to offset increasing app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditure, increasing user volume or monetization per user,
or consolidating back-office and technical functions, or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally. 

While
we expect that any mobile applications that we may develop will be free to download from intermediary platforms like the Apple App
Store and the Google Play Store, we intend to offer our users the opportunity to purchase subscriptions and features within the
applications. These purchases will in most cases be required to be processed through the in-app
payment systems provided by the intermediary, thus requiring us to pay them a meaningful share of the revenue we receive from these transactions. 

While
we expect to innovate and develop our own payment systems and methods, given the expected increase in fees relating to these
intermediary platforms, we may in the future need to offset these increased fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditure as a
percentage of revenue, increasing user volume or monetization per user, or consolidating back-office or technical functions, or by engaging
in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally. 

16 

Challenges
properly managing the use of artificial intelligence could result in reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability. 

We
and our licensees are working to integrate AI technologies into our respective services, which integrations may become important to
our operations over time. Competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their services more quickly or more
successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations.
Additionally, AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed. If the content or recommendations that AI applications assist
in producing are or are alleged to be deficient, inaccurate, offensive, biased, or otherwise improper or harmful, we or our
licensees may face reputational consequences or legal liability, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations
may be adversely affected. Furthermore, the use of AI has been known to result in, and may in the future result in, cybersecurity
incidents that implicate the personal data of end users of AI-enhanced services. Any such cybersecurity incidents related to our use
of AI or our licensees use of AI could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. AI also presents emerging
ethical issues, and if our use of AI becomes controversial, we may experience reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal
liability. The rapid evolution of AI will require the dedication of significant resources to develop, test, and maintain AI
technologies, including to further implement AI ethically in order to minimize unintended harmful impact. While we will aim to
deploy AI responsibly and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in
identifying or resolving issues before they arise. 

The
legal and regulatory landscape surrounding generative AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain, including in the areas of
intellectual property, discrimination, cybersecurity, and privacy and data protection. Compliance with existing, new, and changing
laws, regulations, and industry standards relating to AI may limit some uses of AI, impose significant operational costs, and limit
our ability to develop, deploy, or use AI technologies. Furthermore, the integration of AI technologies into our products and
services may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny. Failure to appropriately respond to this evolving
landscape may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or reputational harm. 

Foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations. 

Because
our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar but our revenue may be received in various other currencies due to our international operations,
our revenue could be reduced when translated into U.S. dollars during periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar. In addition, as foreign
currency exchange rates fluctuate, the translation of our international revenue into U.S. dollar-denominated operating results affects
the period-to-period comparability of such results and could also result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses. 

We
depend on our key personnel. 

Our
future success will depend on our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled individuals across
the markets where we operate, with the continued contributions of management, as well as contributions from sales teams and technology teams, being especially
critical to our success. Competition for well-qualified employees is intense, and our continued ability to compete effectively depends,
in part, on our ability to attract new employees. 

Effective
succession planning is also important to our future success. If we fail to ensure the effective transfer of management or other institutional
knowledge, our ability to execute short- and long-term strategic, financial, and operating goals, as well as our business, financial
condition, and results of operations generally, could be adversely affected. 

In
addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving, such as recent broad shifts to hybrid work models.
If we do not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect our culture, reputation, and operational
flexibility going forward. 

17 

Our
success may depend, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructure and on our ability to enhance, expand, and adapt these in
a timely and cost-effective manner. 

To
succeed with our own offerings for end users, our systems and infrastructure must perform well on a consistent basis. We may from
time to time experience system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable and prevent our services from
functioning properly for our users. Any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons, including as a result of our own
actions, actions by government agencies, cyberattacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software
bugs, acts of God, and similar events. While we expect to have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations, not
all of our systems and infrastructure will be fully redundant, disaster recovery planning will not be sufficient for all
eventualities, and we may not have insurance coverage that compensates us fully, or at all, for any
losses that we may suffer. Any interruptions or outages, regardless of the cause, could negatively impact our users 
experiences, tarnish our reputation, and decrease demand for our services, any or all of which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 

We
will work on our technology and network to improve the experience of our users, accommodate substantial increases in the volume of traffic
to our various platforms, and ensure acceptable load times for our services, and keep up with changes in technology and user preferences.
Any failure to do so in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely affect our users experience with our various services,
thereby negatively impacting the demand for our services, and could increase our costs, either of which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 

From
time to time, we may augment and enhance, or transition to other, enterprise resource planning, human resources, financial, or other
systems. Such actions may cause us to experience difficulties in managing our systems and processes, which could disrupt our operations,
the management of our finances, and the reporting of our financial results, which, in turn, may result in our inability to manage the
growth of our business and to accurately forecast and report our results, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations. 

We
may not be able to protect our systems and infrastructure from cyberattacks and may be adversely affected by cyberattacks experienced
by third parties. 

If
we build out our own online offerings, we may find ourselves targeted by cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other
destructive or disruptive software, distributed denial of service attacks, and attempts to misappropriate customer information,
including personal user data, credit card information, and account login credentials. While we would expect to invest in the protection
of our systems and infrastructure, in related personnel and training, and in employing a data minimization strategy where
appropriate, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breaches in our systems or other such events from
occurring. Any cyber or similar attack that we are unable to protect ourselves against could damage our systems and infrastructure,
prevent us from providing our services, tarnish our reputation, result in the disclosure of confidential or sensitive information of
our users, and be costly to remedy, as well as subject us to investigation by regulatory authorities or to litigation that could
result in liability to third parties. 

The
impact of cyber or similar attacks experienced by any third parties who provide services to us or might otherwise process data on our
behalf could have a similar effect on us. Even cyber or similar attacks that do not directly affect us or our third-party service providers
or data processors may result in widespread access to user data, for instance through account login credentials that such users might
have used across multiple internet sites, including our sites, or directly through access to user data that these third-party service
providers could process in the context of the services they provide to us. These events can lead to government enforcement actions, fines,
and litigation, as well as a loss of consumer confidence generally, which could make users less likely to use or continue to use our
services. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

18 

Our
success will depend, in part, on the integrity of third-party systems and infrastructure. 

If
we develop our own offerings for end users, we may rely on third parties in connection with the provision of our services generally,
as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users. These third parties would likely include data centers and
cloud-based, hosted web service providers, as well as third-party computer systems, service providers, and broadband and other
communications systems. We will have no control over any of these third parties or their operations, and such third-party systems
are increasingly complex. Any changes in service levels at our data centers or hosted web service providers or any interruptions,
outages, or delays in our systems or those of our third-party providers, deterioration in the performance of these systems, or cyber
or similar attacks on these systems could impair our ability to provide our services or process transactions with our users, which
would adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

If
the security of personal and confidential or sensitive user information that we maintain and store is breached or otherwise accessed
by unauthorized persons, it may be costly to mitigate the impact of such an event and our reputation could be harmed. 

If
we develop our own offerings for end users, we will receive, process, store, and transmit a significant amount of personal user and
other confidential or sensitive information, including, without limitation, credit card information and user-to-user communications.
We would also likely enable our users to share their personal information with each other. In some cases, we might engage
third-party service providers to store or process this information. We will work to protect the security, integrity, and
confidentiality of this information, but we cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur in
the future or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to, or will not use for unauthorized purposes, this information
despite our efforts. When such events occur, we may not be able to remedy them, and we may be required by an increasing number of
laws to notify regulators and individuals whose personal information was processed, used, or disclosed without authorization. We may
also be subject to claims against us, including government enforcement actions, fines, and litigation, and have to expend
significant capital and other resources to mitigate the impact of such events, including by developing and implementing protections
to prevent future events of this nature from occurring. When breaches of security (or the security of our service providers) occur,
the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures, the security measures of our service providers, and our reputation may
be harmed, we may lose current and potential users, and our reputation and competitive position may be tarnished, any or all of
which might adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Our
business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations, including with respect to data privacy and platform liability, particularly if we develop our own offerings for end users. These
laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in changes to our business practices, increased
cost of operations, declines in user growth or engagement, legal claims, monetary penalties, or other harm to our business. 

As
we plan on expanding our footprint internationally, we will be subject to a variety of laws and regulations that involve matters that
are important to or may otherwise impact our business. We are indirectly affected by laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we do
not operate but our licensees do. Some laws and regulations can be enforced by private parties in addition to governmental entities and
are constantly evolving and subject to change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations
are often uncertain, particularly in the rapidly evolving industry in which we and our licensees operate, and such laws and regulations
may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. These laws and regulations, as well as any associated
inquiries, investigations, or other government actions, may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new services,
require changes to or cessation of certain business practices, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant
management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or modifications to existing business
practices. 

Tax
laws, in particular, are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities. While we endeavor to comply with applicable law,
there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a position contrary to us, and if so, that such position
will not adversely affect us, directly or indirectly. Any events of this nature could adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. 

Proposed
or new legislation and regulations could also adversely affect our business. To the extent new or more stringent measures are required
to be implemented, impose new liability, or limit or remove existing protections, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected. 

19 

The
adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the popularity or growth in use of the internet or our services, including
laws or regulations that undermine open and neutrally administered internet access, could decrease user demand for our service offerings
and increase our cost of doing business, thereby negatively impacting our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

If we develop our own offerings for end users, we will be subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments, including data security breaches and fraud that we or third parties
experience, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

If we develop our own offerings for end users, we will likely accept payment from our users primarily through credit card transactions and certain online payment service providers. When we or
a third party experiences a data security breach involving credit card information, affected cardholders will often cancel their credit
cards. In the case of a breach experienced by a third party, the more sizable the third party s customer base and the greater the
number of credit card accounts impacted, the more likely it is that our users would be impacted by the breach. To the extent our users
are affected by such a breach experienced by us or a third party, we would need to contact such users to obtain new credit card information
and process any pending transactions. It is likely that we would not be able to reach all affected users, and even if we could, some
users new credit card information may not be obtained and some pending transactions may not be processed, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Even
if our users are not directly impacted by a given data security breach, they may lose confidence in the ability of service providers
to protect their personal information generally, which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online or choose alternative
payment methods that are less convenient or more costly for us or otherwise restrict our ability to process payments without significant
effort on the part of the user or us, or both. 

Additionally,
if we fail to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face litigation, fines, governmental enforcement action,
civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures, significantly higher credit card-related and remediation costs,
or refusal by credit card processors to continue to process payments on our behalf, any of which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 

If we develop our own offerings for end users, inappropriate
actions by certain of our users could be attributed to us and damage our reputation, which in turn could adversely affect our business. 

Users
of our services may in the future be physically, financially, emotionally, or otherwise harmed by individuals that such users meet through
one of our services. If any users suffer or allege to have suffered any such harm, we could experience negative publicity or legal action
that could damage our reputation. Similar events affecting users of our competitors services could result in negative publicity
for our industry generally, which could in turn negatively affect our business. 

In
addition, our reputation may be adversely affected by actions of our users that are deemed to be hostile, offensive, defamatory, inappropriate,
untrue, or unlawful. While our focus to date on offline matchmaking has helped to avoid such incidents, and while we intend to develop
systems and processes that aim to monitor and review the appropriateness of content accessible through our online services, together
with policies regarding illegal, offensive, or inappropriate use of our services, our users could nonetheless engage in activities that
violate our policies. Such bad actors may also use emerging technologies, such as AI, to engage in such activities, making it more difficult
for us to detect and prevent such negative behavior. Our safeguards may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our reputation, especially
if such hostile, offensive, or inappropriate use is well-publicized. 

We
may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third
parties. 

We
currently rely exclusively on patents that we license out, and we expect, in the future, that we will rely heavily on our trademarks
and related domain names and logos for marketing and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition. We also expect to rely on other
patented and patent-pending proprietary technologies and trade secrets, such as our own app, relating to our services. 

20 

We
will continue to rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights.
For example, we continue to apply to register, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed
and used, and we may reserve, register, and renew domain names as we deem appropriate. Effective trademark protection may not
be available or sought in every country in which our services are made available, and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks
governed by private contract. Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or registered by us, even if available. 

We
generally will seek to apply for patents or other similar statutory protections as and when we deem appropriate, based on then-current
facts and circumstances. No assurance can be given that any patent application we have filed or will file will result in a patent being
issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies. In addition,
no assurance can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing
upon patents we own. 

Despite
these measures, our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights
could arise, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization, our existing trademarks,
patents, or trade secrets could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, or laws and interpretations of laws regarding the enforceability
of existing intellectual property rights could change over time in a manner that provides less protection. The occurrence of any of these
events could tarnish our reputation, limit our marketing ability, or impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with
similar technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We
may also occasionally be subject to legal proceedings and claims regarding intellectual property, including claims of alleged infringement
of trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights held by third parties and of invalidity of our own rights.
In addition, we may decide we should engage in litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and
patents, or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of
outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We
intend to expand to various international markets, including markets in which we have limited experience, and as a result, we face additional
risks in connection with those operations. 

Operating
internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, exposes us to a number of additional risks, such as: 

operational
 and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences; 

difficulties
 in staffing and managing international operations; 

differing
 levels of social and technological acceptance of our services or lack of acceptance of them generally; 

differing
 and potentially adverse tax laws; 

compliance
 challenges due to different laws and regulatory environments, particularly in the case of privacy, data security, intermediary or
 platform liability, and consumer protection; 

competitive
 environments that favor local businesses or local knowledge of such environments; 

limitations
 on the level of intellectual property protection; and 

trade
 sanctions, political unrest, terrorism, war, and epidemics, or the threat of any of these events. 

These
risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

21 

We
are subject to litigation, and adverse outcomes in such litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 

From
time to time, we may become subject to litigation, and to various legal proceedings relating to employment matters, intellectual property
matters, and privacy and consumer protection laws, as well as stockholder derivative suits, class action lawsuits, mass arbitrations,
and other matters. Such litigation and proceedings may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief, may result
in significant costs for legal representation, arbitration fees, or other legal or related services, or might necessitate changes to
our business or operations. The defense of these actions is likely to be time consuming and expensive. We will evaluate these litigation
claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential loss.
Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings as
and when required or appropriate. These assessments and estimates will be based on information available to our management at the time
of such assessment or estimation and will involve a significant amount of judgment. As a result, actual outcomes or losses could differ
materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. Our failure to successfully defend or settle any of these
litigation claims or legal proceedings could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Our
operations are subject to volatile global economic conditions, particularly those that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending
behavior. 

Adverse
macroeconomic conditions, including lower consumer confidence, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, the availability and cost of credit,
and weakness in the economies in which we or our licensees and the users of our services or those of our licensees are located may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. In recent years, the United States, Europe, and other key global markets have experienced historically high
levels of inflation, which have impacted, among other things, employee compensation expenses. If inflation rates rise again or continue
to remain historically high or further increase in those locations where inflation rates remain elevated, it will likely affect our expenses,
and may reduce consumer discretionary spending, which could affect the buying power of our users and lead to a reduction in demand for
our services. Other events and trends that could result in decreased levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending include
a general economic downturn, recessionary concerns, high unemployment levels, and increased interest rates, as well as any sudden disruption
in business conditions. Economic growth in Mainland China has declined notably in recent years, affecting us through the impact on Hong
Kong s economy and potentially on a China-based licensee. Additionally, geopolitical developments, such as wars in Ukraine
and the Middle East, tensions between the United States and China, climate change, and the responses by central banking authorities to
control inflation (in some economies of the West) or boost growth (in China), can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability
globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. 

Our
financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce the expected returns. 

From
time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation, and
expansion of existing businesses, such as our digital commerce operations, which require substantial cash investments and management
attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability; however, significant investments
are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. The failure of
any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results
and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. 

22 

We
have limited financial resources. Our former independent registered auditors report includes an explanatory paragraph stating
that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

As
a result of our deficiency in working capital on April 30, 2024 and other factors, our former auditors have included a paragraph in their
audit report regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
have recorded net losses since inception and have significant accumulated deficits. We have relied upon loans and equity financings
for operating capital. Total revenues may be insufficient to pay off debt and fund operations. We may be required to rely
on further debt financing, further loans from related parties, and private or public placements of shares of Common Stock for our
additional cash needs. Such funding sources may not be available, or the terms of such funding sources may not be acceptable to the
Company. 

We
may need additional capital in the future to finance our planned growth, which we may not be able to raise or which may only be available
on terms unfavorable to us or our stockholders, and this may result in our inability to fund our working capital requirements and harm
our operational results. 

Our cash on hand, together with cash generated from product sales, services,
cash equivalents, and short-term investments may not meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve
months. We may need to raise additional funds to finance our operations and implement our growth strategy, or to respond to competitive
pressures or perceived opportunities, such as investment, acquisition, marketing, and development activities. 

If
we experience operating difficulties or other factors, many of which may
be beyond our control, that cause our revenue or cash flow from operations, if any, to decrease, we may be limited in our ability to spend
the capital necessary to complete our development, marketing, and growth programs. Additional financing, if required, might not be available
on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund
our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our business, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures
may be significantly limited. In such a capital restricted situation, we could be compelled to curtail our marketing, development, and
operational activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis. 

Our
internal controls may be inadequate, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated
to the public. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over our financial reporting. As defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal controls over financial reporting involves a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal
executive and principal financial officer, and effected by the board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the Company; 

provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles and to ensure that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
 accordance with authorizations of management or directors of the Company; and 

provide
 reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Our
internal controls may be inadequate or ineffective, which could cause financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation
being disseminated to the public. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision. 

23 

Failure
to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to face regulatory action and also cause investors to
lose confidence in our reported financial information, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future
prospects. 

Our
auditors will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section
404 until we are no longer a smaller reporting company . 

The
costs of being a public company could result in us being unable to continue as a going concern. 

As
a public company, we are required to comply with numerous financial reporting and legal requirements, including those pertaining to audits
and internal controls. The costs of maintaining public company reporting requirements could be significant and may preclude us from seeking
financing or equity investments on terms acceptable to us and our shareholders. We estimate these costs to be in excess of 500,000 per
year, and they may be higher if our business volume or business activity increases significantly. Our current estimate of costs does
not include the necessary expenses associated with compliance, documentation, and specific reporting requirements of Section 404 as we
will not be subject to the full reporting requirements of Section 404 until we no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company . 

If
our revenue is insufficient or non-existent, or we cannot satisfy many of these costs through the issuance of shares or debt, we may
be unable to satisfy these costs in the normal course of business. This would result in our being unable to continue as a going concern. 

If
we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, then the price of the Common Stock may be adversely affected. 

Our
internal controls over financial reporting may have weaknesses and conditions that could require correction or remediation, the disclosure
of which may have an adverse impact on the price of the Common Stock. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal
controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely
affect our public disclosure regarding our business, prospects, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, management s
assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal
controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions
that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or any disclosure of management s critical assessment
of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of the Common Stock. 

Any
acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition. 

We
have in the past made (and may, from time to time, consider) acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies. A primary
component of our growth strategy has been to acquire complementary businesses to grow our Company. For example, we acquired the business
of Foundation Sports Systems, LLC, in our fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, and the acquisitions of PlaySight and Gameface closed in
the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. In the Company s fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023, the Company divested PlaySight and
75 of its interest in Foundation Sports as the required monthly cash burn became increasingly difficult to manage as inflation rose
and the cost of manufacturing the Company s non-technological products grew. As a result, the Company sold PlaySight back to its
original owners in November 2022, and the Company sold most of Foundation Sports back to their original owners, with an option to purchase
any remaining interests. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, products. and businesses as a primary component of our growth strategy
to enhance the features and functionality of our technology offerings, expand our customer base, and provide access to new markets and
increase economies of scale. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired businesses,
the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns, and potential adverse effects on existing business relationships,
all of which could cause our actual growth or operating results to differ from our expectations. In addition, any acquisitions could involve
the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions
that we pursue or that such acquisitions will perform as planned or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow. Any such failure
could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our
former independent auditor, Olayinka Oyebola Co., and its principal have been charged by the SEC in connection with securities fraud
allegations. 

Our
former independent auditor, OOC, has been charged by the SEC in connection with allegedly aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud
provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC also charged OOC s principal, Olayinka Oyebola, with allegedly aiding and abetting his client s violation of lying to auditors. The SEC complaint
seeks civil penalties as well as permanent injunctive relief, including an order permanently barring Olayinka Oyebola and OOC from acting
as auditors or accountants for U.S. public companies or otherwise providing substantial assistance in the preparation of financial statements
filed with the SEC. This action could affect the credibility of the financial statements audited by OOC. If their audit work is found
to be deficient, our financial reporting could be questioned, leading to potential restatements, delays in regulatory filings, or reputational
harm. If OOC is barred from acting as auditors or accountants for U.S. public companies, we will be unable to include the financial statements
reviewed by OOC in any filing made after that date, and our financial statements will need to be reaudited. Any of these outcomes could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and stock price, which could contribute to the loss of all or part
of your investment. 

On
October 30, 2024, the Board of Directors and the audit committee approved the engagement of B A as the Company s independent registered public
accounting firm for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2025, effective immediately, and dismissed OOC as the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm. 

Fluctuations
in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may have a negative effect on our operating results. 

We
may be subject to income taxes in multiple jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include
reserves for uncertain tax provisions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any one time, many tax years may be subject to audit by various
taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these
issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur
and exposures are evaluated. Further, our effective tax rate in a given financial period may be materially impacted by changes in mix
and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. In addition, tax legislation enacted in the future could
negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates. 

We
could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities, or increased volatility in our effective
tax rate. 

We
are subject to the tax laws in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and
regulations, or their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change. On December 22, 2017, the U.S.
enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ), which includes a number of significant changes to previous U.S. tax laws
that impact us, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and a reduction
in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, among other changes. The Tax Act also transitions
U.S. international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on
non-U.S. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation. 

We
earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions. There have been
proposals to reform foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.
Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law,
could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows. 

Portions
of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings. We also utilize tax rulings
and other agreements to obtain certainty in the treatment of certain tax matters. These holidays and rulings expire in whole or in part
from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met. The impact of
any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate. 

25 

We
may also be subject to the examination of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service IRS and other tax authorities.
We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision
for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes
could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could
have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made.
For example, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although
we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place,
tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with
differing statutory tax rates. 

For
as long as we are a smaller reporting company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements that
apply to other publicly reporting companies. We cannot predict whether the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting
companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors. 

We
are currently a smaller reporting company. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we may choose
to take advantage of certain exemptions from reporting requirements applicable to other publicly reporting companies that are not smaller
reporting companies. These include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements for the assessment of our internal
controls over financial reporting provided by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and not being
required to provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger publicly reporting companies. We cannot predict
if investors will find our common shares less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common
shares less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our shares
and our share price may be more volatile. Further, as a result of these scaled regulatory requirements, our disclosure may be more limited
than that of other publicly reporting companies and you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of such companies. 

We
are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, requiring us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection
with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit. 

We
are required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
In order to comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm will have to review our financial statements
on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel will have to review and assist
in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this
time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined
at this time and will affect the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will
be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. 

If
we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose
confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of the Common Stock, could drop significantly. 

Connexa
may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on its business and operations following the Acquisition. 

Connexa
may be exposed to increased litigation from stockholders, customers, suppliers, distributors, consumers, and other third parties following
the Acquisition. Such litigation may have an adverse impact on Connexa s business and results of operations or may cause disruptions
to Connexa s operations. 

26 

Declaration,
payment, and amounts of dividends, if any, to stockholders of Connexa following the Acquisition will be uncertain. 

Connexa
has not historically paid cash dividends on its capital stock. Whether any dividends are declared or paid to stockholders of Connexa
following the Acquisition, and the amounts of any such dividends that are declared or paid, are uncertain and depend on a number of factors.
The Board of Directors following the Acquisition will have the discretion to determine the dividend policy of Connexa, including the
amount and timing of dividends, if any, that Connexa may declare from time to time, which may be impacted by any of the following factors: 

Connexa
 may not have enough cash to pay such dividends or to repurchase shares due to its cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash
 flow, or financial position; 

decisions
 on whether, when, and in what amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of the
 Connexa Board of Directors following the Acquisition, which could change its dividend practices at any time and for any reason; 

the
 amount of dividends that Connexa may distribute to its stockholders is subject to restrictions under law and is potentially limited
 by the terms of any future indebtedness that Connexa may incur; and 

certain
 limitations on the amount of dividends subsidiaries of Connexa can distribute to Connexa, as imposed by law, regulators, or agreements. 

Stockholders
should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have not been declared. 

Risks
Related to Doing Business in Hong Kong 

A
joint statement by the SEC and the PCAOB, rule changes by Nasdaq, the HFCAA and AHFCAA, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act all call
for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors,
especially non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected by the PCAOB. These developments could add uncertainty to our continued listing. 

On
April 21, 2020, the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB released a joint statement highlighting the risks associated with investing in companies based
in or having substantial operations in emerging markets including China. The joint statement emphasized the risks associated with lack
of access for the PCAOB to inspect auditors and audit work papers in China and higher risks of fraud in emerging markets. 

On
December 18, 2020, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the HFCAA was signed and became law. This
legislation, among other things, bans an issuer s securities from trading if the PCAOB is unable to inspect the issuer s
public accounting firm for three consecutive years (later reduced to two years by the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the AHFCAA )). 

On
December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize interim final rules previously adopted in March 2021 to implement the submission
and disclosure requirements of the HFCAA. 

While
the PCAOB initially determined that it was unable to completely inspect or investigate registered public accounting
firms headquartered in mainland China or Hong Kong because of a position taken by one or more authorities in each of those
jurisdictions, this
determination was effectively reversed on December 15, 2022, following the CSRC, the Ministry of Finance of the PRC, and the PCAOB
signing a Statement of Protocol governing inspections and investigations of audit firms based in China and Hong Kong permitting the
PCAOB to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and to transfer information unfettered to the SEC. Should
any PRC authorities obstruct or otherwise fail to facilitate the PCAOB s access in the future, the PCAOB would consider the
need to issue a new determination. 

27 

Neither
our current auditor, B A, nor our former auditor, OOC, is headquartered in mainland
China or Hong Kong. Nevertheless, should B A or OOC in the future have any work papers in China or Hong Kong that the PCAOB is unable
to fully inspect, it will be difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of B A or OOC s audit procedures or equity control procedures,
and investors could consequently lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures or the quality of our financial
statements, which could adversely affect us and our securities. Furthermore, if trading in our securities is prohibited under the HFCAA
in the future because the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate B A at such future time, an exchange will likely
delist our securities. 

The
Chinese government, in general, could exercise significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and has made statements
indicating an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and over foreign investment in China-based
issuers. 

Although
our subsidiary Yuanyu Enterprise Management Company, Limited YYEM is based in a special administrative region of the PRC, which enjoys separate governing and economic systems from
that of mainland China under the principle of one country, two systems, Hong Kong is part of China and, as such, the Chinese government
could intervene or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in YYEM s operations and the value
of our Common Stock. Any actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas
or over foreign investment in China-based issuers, in particular any effort to extend such actions directly or indirectly to Hong Kong-based
companies, could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause
the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 

Greater
oversight by CAC over data security, particularly for companies seeking to list on a foreign exchange, could adversely impact our business
and our offering. 

Over
the years, the PRC has enacted a number of laws and regulations aimed at governing the collection and security of personal data. These
include the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which took effect on February 15, 2022 and require a government review of critical information
infrastructure operators CIIOs and of internet operators that possesses the personal information of at least one million
users or meet certain other criteria; the Network Data Security Administration (Draft for Comments), published in 2021 and not yet enacted,
which provides that companies engaging in data processing activities that may affect national security must apply for a cybersecurity
review by the CAC under certain circumstances; the PRC Data Security Law, promulgated in 2021, which imposes certain requirements for
the collection and processing of data in order to protect its security; the Personal Information Protection Law, promulgated in 2021,
which integrates various scattered rules with respect to personal information rights and privacy protection; the Rules on the Scope of
Necessary Personal Information for Common Types of Mobile Internet Applications, which came into effect in 2021 and prohibits the operators
of mobile apps from denying users access to the apps just because they do not consent to the collection of unnecessary personal information;
and the Measures for the Security Assessment of Data Cross-border Transfer, effective in 2022, which require data processors to apply
for a cross-border security assessment coordinated by the CAC under certain circumstances, including where they transfer personal information
overseas and have already transferred personal information of more than 100,000 people, or sensitive personal information of more than
10,000 people, overseas since the start of the previous year. (See also the discussion of the Confidentiality and Archives Administration
Provisions, below.) 

28 

We
do not believe YYEM is subject to cybersecurity review by the CAC, or to any of the other personal data-related laws and regulations
described above, since YYEM is a Hong Kong company without subsidiaries or operations in the PRC. In addition, it does not currently
have, and does not anticipate that it will be collecting, over one million users personal information in the foreseeable future,
which might otherwise subject it to the Cybersecurity Review Measures. YYEM has not received any notice from any authorities identifying
it as a CIIO or otherwise requiring it to undergo a cybersecurity review or network data security review by the CAC. 

There
remains uncertainty as to how the Cybersecurity Review Measures and the Security Administration Draft will be interpreted or implemented
and whether the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, may adopt new laws, regulations, rules, or detailed implementation and interpretation
related to the Cybersecurity Review Measures and the Security Administration Draft. There is no assurance that YYEM will be able to fully
or timely comply with any of the personal data and data security laws should they be deemed to be applicable to its operations. There
is no certainty as to how any review or other actions would impact YYEM s operations, and we cannot guarantee that any clearance
could be obtained or maintained if approved. 

In
the future, YYEM may be subject to PRC laws and regulations, including those regarding corporate structure, overseas listings, data-
and cybersecurity, and anti-monopoly concerns, which could result in a material negative impact on its operations and the value of the
securities we are registering for sale. 

YYEM
is incorporated and registered under the laws of Hong Kong. YYEM does not have, nor does it intend to have, any subsidiary, VIE structure
or direct operations in mainland China. All of YYEM s revenue and profit is currently generated by operations in Hong Kong. The
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the Basic Law provides that PRC laws and regulations shall
not be applied in Hong Kong except for those listed in Annex III of the Basic Law, which is confined to laws relating to national defense,
foreign affairs, and other matters that are not within the scope of autonomy. YYEM therefore is not directly subject to PRC laws and
regulations regarding the general conduct of its business or regarding overseas listings. 

Nevertheless,
with its headquarters and substantial operations in Hong Kong, YYEM faces risks and uncertainties associated with the complex and evolving
PRC laws and regulations, including whether and how PRC government statements and regulatory developments, such as those relating to
corporate structure, overseas listings, data- and cybersecurity, and anti-monopoly concerns, would be applicable to Hong Kong companies
such as YYEM, and whether and when the Chinese government might exercise significant oversight over the conduct of business in Hong Kong.
If YYEM were to become subject to PRC laws and regulations, it could incur material costs to ensure compliance, and it might be subject
to fines, no longer be permitted to conduct offerings to foreign investors, or no longer be permitted to continue business operations
as presently conducted. 

The
uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws and the fact that rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little advance
notice, along with the risk that the Chinese government may intervene in or influence YYEM s operations, could result in a material
change in its operations and the value of the securities we are registering, including the possibility that the value of such securities
could become worthless. 

In
recent years, the PRC government initiated, with little advance notice, a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate certain
types of business operations in mainland China, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision
over mainland China-based companies listed overseas using a variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope
of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. For example, the General Office of the Communist Party
of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued a document to crack down on illegal activities
in the securities market, requiring various governmental authorities to strengthen cross-border oversight of law-enforcement and judicial
cooperation, to enhance supervision over mainland China-based companies listed overseas, and to establish and improve the system of extraterritorial
application of the PRC securities laws. The CAC also promulgated the various data security-related measures described above under Greater
oversight by the Cyberspace Administration of China over data security, particularly for companies seeking to list on a foreign exchange,
could adversely impact our business and our offering. As explained above, we believe the Company and its subsidiaries are
not directly subject to the regulations and rules issued by CAC and other governmental agencies. 

29 

On
February 17, 2023, the CSRC released the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Enterprises
(the New Overseas Listing Rules with five interpretive guidelines, which took effect on March 31, 2023. The New Overseas
Listing Rules require Chinese domestic enterprises to complete filings with relevant governmental authorities and report related information
under certain circumstances. The new rules provide that the determination as to whether a Chinese domestic company is indirectly offering
and listing securities on an overseas market shall be made on a substance-over-form basis, and if the issuer meets the following conditions,
the offering and listing will be deemed an indirect overseas offering and listing by a Chinese domestic company: (i) the revenue, profit,
total assets or net assets of the Chinese domestic entity constitutes more than 50 of such item in the issuer s audited consolidated
financial statements for the most recent fiscal year; or (ii) the senior managers in charge of business operations and management of
the issuer are mostly Chinese citizens or with a regular domicile in China, the main locations of its business operations are in China,
or its main business activities are conducted in China. YYEM is headquartered in Hong Kong, and at least 50 of its executive officers
and directors are based in Hong Kong and are not Chinese citizens. Furthermore, all of its assets are located in Hong Kong and all of
its revenue and profit is generated from operations in Hong Kong. We therefore believe that YYEM is not subject to the New Overseas Listing
Rules. 

On
February 24, 2023, the CSRC, the Ministry of Finance, the National Administration of State Secrets Protection, and the National Archives
Administration released the Provisions on Strengthening the Confidentiality and Archives Administration Related to the Overseas Securities
Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the Confidentiality and Archives Administration Provisions ), which took effect
on March 31, 2023. PRC domestic enterprises seeking to offer securities and list in overseas markets, either directly or indirectly,
are required to establish and improve their confidentiality systems and archives work and to complete various approval and filing procedures
with competent authorities, if such PRC domestic enterprises or their overseas listing entities provide or publicly disclose documents
or materials involving state secrets and work secrets of state organs to relevant securities companies, securities service institutions,
overseas regulatory agencies, or other entities and individuals. 

As
of the date of this prospectus, these new laws and guidelines have not impacted YYEM s ability to conduct its business. YYEM is
headquartered in Hong Kong and does not have a VIE structure. YYEM is not a cyberspace operator with personal information of more than
1 million users or activities that affect or may affect the national security of China, and it does not possess documents and materials
likely to affect the national security or public interest of China. However, any change in foreign investment regulations or other policies
in China, or related enforcement actions by the PRC government, could result in a material change in YYEM s operations and the
value of our Common Stock and could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer our Common Stock to investors or cause
the value of our Common Stock to significantly decline or be worthless. 

We
are subject to risks relating to economic, political, legal, and social conditions in Hong Kong. 

Even
though much of YYEM s revenue is derived from licensees outside Hong Kong, any adverse changes in the economic, political, legal,
and social conditions of Hong Kong could lead to an adverse impact on the demand for YYEM s services and result in deteriorating
financial performance of the Company. 

We
cannot assure you that there will not be any political movements or large-scale political unrest in Hong Kong that could adversely impact
the market. If such unrest or movement persists for a substantial period of time, it may lead to disruption of the general economic,
political, and social conditions in Hong Kong, and YYEM s overall business, results of operations, and financial condition may
be adversely affected. 

30 

The
Law of the PRC on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the Hong Kong National Security
Law could impact YYEM s operations in Hong Kong. 

On
June 30, 2020, the Standing Committee of the PRC National People s Congress adopted the Hong Kong National Security Law. This law
defines the duties of the government bodies responsible for safeguarding national security and specifies four categories of offences
 secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security
 and their corresponding penalties. On July 14, 2020, the U.S. President signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act (the HKAA ),
into law, authorizing the U.S. administration to impose blocking sanctions against individuals and entities who are determined to have
materially contributed to the erosion of Hong Kong s autonomy. On August 7, 2020, the U.S. government imposed HKAA-authorized sanctions
on eleven individuals, including the then Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the current Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee. On
October 14, 2020, the U.S. State Department submitted to relevant committees of Congress the report required under the HKAA, identifying
persons materially contributing to the failure of the Government of China to meet its obligations under the Joint Declaration
or the Basic Law. The HKAA further authorizes secondary sanctions, including the imposition of blocking sanctions, against foreign
financial institutions that knowingly conduct a significant transaction with a foreign person sanctioned under this authority. The imposition
of sanctions may directly affect foreign financial institutions as well as any third parties or customers dealing with any foreign financial
institution that is targeted. The ramifications of the Hong Kong National Security Law and the HKAA are still unfolding, and it is therefore
difficult to predict the full impact on Hong Kong and companies located in Hong Kong. If YYEM is accused of violating the Hong Kong National
Security Law or the HKAA by competent authorities, its business operations, financial position, and results of operations could be materially
and adversely affected. 

Risks
Related to Ownership of Our Shares 

Our
stock price may be volatile, or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you could lose all or part of your investment
as a result. 

You
should consider an investment in our securities to be risky, and you should invest in our securities only if you can withstand a significant
loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment. The market price of our Common Stock could be subject to significant
fluctuations in response to the factors described in this section and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Among the
factors that could affect our stock price are: 

actual
 or anticipated variations in our quarterly and annual operating results or those of companies perceived to be similar to us; 

Changes
 in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors, or differences
 between our actual results and those expected by investors and securities analysts; 

Fluctuations
 in the market valuations of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; 

The
 public s response to our or our competitors filings with the SEC or announcements regarding new products or services,
 enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic investments, litigation, restructurings, or other significant matters; 

Speculation
 about our business in the press or the investment community; 

Future
 sales of our shares; 

Actions
 by our competitors; 

Additions
 or departures of members of our senior management or other key personnel; and 

The
 passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry. 

31 

In
addition, the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect
the market price of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating
performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political, and market conditions,
such as recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect
the market price of our shares. 

If
any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that, even
if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management. 

The
trading market for our common shares will be influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and
our business. The price of our common shares could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our common shares or if those
analysts issue a sell recommendation or other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one or
more of the analysts who elect to cover us downgrade our common shares, our share price could decline rapidly. If one or more of these
analysts cease coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause the price and trading volume of our
Common Stock to decline. 

We
do not intend to pay dividends on the shares of our Common Stock. 

We
intend to retain all of our earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business and do
not anticipate paying cash dividends. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors,
subject to compliance with applicable law and any contractual provisions, and will depend on, among other factors, our results of operations,
financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. You should expect to receive
a return on your investment in our Common Stock only if the market price of the stock increases, which may never occur. 

Our
stockholders may not be able to enforce judgments entered by U.S. courts against our officers and directors. 

We
are incorporated in the State of Delaware. However, all of our directors and executive officers reside outside the United States. As
a result, our stockholders may not be able to effect service of process upon those persons within the United States or enforce against
those persons judgments obtained in U.S. courts. 

Future
sales of shares of Common Stock may result in a decrease in the market price of our Common Stock, even if our business is doing well. 

The
market price of our Common Stock could decline due to sales of a large number of shares of Common Stock in the market or the perception
that such sales could occur. This could make it more difficult to raise funds through future offerings of Common Stock. 

Our
Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of the authorized 1,000,000,000 shares
of Common Stock that are not issued or reserved for issuance under convertible or exchangeable instruments. In addition, we may attempt
to raise additional capital by selling shares, possibly at a deep discount to the market price. These actions may result in material
dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders and the book value of our Common Stock. 

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or they publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock
price and trading volume could decline. 

The
trading market for our Common Stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about
us or our business. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on our company. If no securities
or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price of our stock may be negatively impacted. In the event that securities
or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or
unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company
or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume

Holders
of our Common Stock may be diluted by the future issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or preferred stock, or securities convertible
into shares of Common Stock or preferred stock, in connection with incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise; future sales of such shares
in the public market or the expectation that such sales may occur may decrease the market price of our Common Stock. 

We
could issue a significant number of shares of Common Stock post-Acquisition, for example in connection with investments or acquisitions.
We may increase the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for the Slinger Bag Inc. Global Share Incentive Plan (2020) which would
provide additional shares of Common Stock for the issuance, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in such plan,
of long-term incentive compensation which may take the form of options, restricted stock units or other securities. Any of these issuances
could dilute existing stockholders of the Company, and such dilution could be significant. Moreover, such dilution could have a material
adverse effect on the market price for the shares of our Common Stock. Any issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may
adversely affect the voting power of the holders of shares of our Common Stock, either by diluting the voting power of our Common Stock
if the preferred stock votes together with the Common Stock as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the
right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote, even if the action were approved by the holders of our Common Stock.
The future issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms
favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our Common Stock by making an investment in the
Common Stock less attractive. For example, investors in the Common Stock may not wish to purchase Common Stock at a price above the conversion
price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase
Common Stock at the lower conversion price, causing economic dilution to the holders of Common Stock. As of April 30, 2024, the Company
had no shares of preferred stock authorized, issued or outstanding.
