 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to Rigetti , the Company , we , us , and our refer to Rigetti Computing, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). This includes, without limitation, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations. These statements constitute projections, forecasts and forward-looking statements, and are not guarantees of performance. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. Any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intends, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, goal, objective, design, seek, target, should, could, will, would or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim any duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We caution you that these forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include, for example, statements about: the sufficiency of our cash resources, our expectations with respect to when we will need to obtain additional capital, and our ability to raise additional capital when needed and on attractive terms, our ability to achieve milestones, and/or technological advancements, including with respect to executing on our technology roadmap and developing practical applications, the potential of quantum computing and estimated market size and market growth including with respect to our long-term business strategies for sales of quantum computers and quantum computing as a service Quantum Computing as a Service, or QCaaS ), the success of our partnerships and collaborations, our ability to accelerate our development of multiple generations of quantum processors, customer concentration and the risk that a significant portion of our revenue currently depends on contracts with the public sector, the outcome of any legal proceedings that have or may be instituted against us or others, our ability to execute on our business strategy, including monetization of our products, our financial performance, growth rate and market opportunity, our ability to maintain compliance with standards relating to the listing of our common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the common stock and Public Warrants (as defined herein) on the Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq ), and the potential liquidity and trading of such securities,

 the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the merger transaction between Rigetti Holdings, Inc. and Supernova Partners Acquisition Company II, Ltd., which may be affected by, among other things, competition, our ability to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers and suppliers and retain our management and key employees, costs related to operating as a public company, our ability to remediate the material weakness in, and establish and maintain, effective internal controls over financial reporting, changes in applicable laws or regulations, the possibility that we may be adversely affected by other economic, business, or competitive factors, the evolution of the markets in which we compete, our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, expansion plans and continue to innovate our existing products and services, unfavorable conditions in our industry, the global economy or global supply chain (including any supply chain impacts from the ongoing military conflicts involving Russia and Ukraine and sanctions related thereto and the state of war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah and the potential for a larger conflict), including levels of future economic activity, inflation, interest rates and financial and credit market fluctuations, changes in applicable laws or regulations, our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors, our estimates regarding expenses, profitability, future revenue, capital requirements and needs for additional financing, our ability or decisions to expand or maintain our existing customer base, and macroeconomic conditions, including worsening global economic conditions, disruptions to and volatility and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets, uncertainty in the levels of future economic activity, inflation and interest rates. 
 These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events, are based on assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors include, without limitation: We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities should be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs until midway through the first quarter of 2026, based on our current business plan, and expectations and assumptions considering current macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, based on our estimates and current business plan, we expect that we will need to obtain additional capital to fund our research and development efforts and business objectives as currently planned. Our estimate does not assume any additional financing, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available. If we are unable to raise additional funding when needed and on attractive terms, we may be required to delay, limit or substantially reduce our quantum computing development efforts. We are in our early stages and have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results of operations.

Table of Contents 
 We have a history of operating losses and expect to incur significant expenses and continuing losses for the foreseeable future. Even if the market in which we compete achieves its anticipated growth levels, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes is subject to annual limitation because of prior cumulative changes in the Company s ownership, and may be further limited in the future if additional ownership changes occur. We have not produced quantum computers with high qubit counts and we face significant barriers in our attempts to produce quantum computers, including the need to invent and develop new technology. If we cannot successfully overcome those barriers, our business will be negatively impacted and could fail. Any future generations of hardware, systems and offerings, including any future generations developed to potentially demonstrate narrow quantum advantage or broad quantum advantage, and our targeted fidelities, each of which is an important anticipated milestone for our technology roadmap and commercialization, may not occur on our anticipated timeline or at all. If our computers fail to achieve quantum advantage, our business, financial condition and future prospects may be harmed. Moreover, the standards by which we measure our progress may be based on assumptions and expectations that are not accurate or that may change as quantum computing evolves. The quantum computing industry is competitive on a global scale and we may not be successful in competing in this industry or establishing and maintaining confidence in our long-term business prospects among current and future partners and customers. We depend on a limited number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue and the loss or temporary loss of a major customer for any reason could harm our financial condition. A significant portion of our revenue depends on contracts with the public sector, and our failure to receive and maintain government contracts or changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of the public sector could have a material adverse effect on our business. There are no assurances that we will be able to successfully commercialize quantum computers from our relationships with cloud providers. We rely on access to high performance third party classical computing through public clouds, high performance computing centers and on-premises computing infrastructure to deliver performant quantum solutions to customers. We may not be able to maintain high quality business relationships and connectivity with these resources which could make it harder for us to reach customers or deliver solutions in a cost-effective manner. We depend on certain suppliers to source products. Failure to maintain our relationship with any of these suppliers, or a failure to replace any of these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our systems depend on the use of certain development tools, supplies, equipment and production methods. If we are unable to procure the necessary tools, supplies and equipment to build our quantum systems, or are unable to do so on a timely and cost-effective basis, and in sufficient quantities, we may incur significant costs or delays which could negatively affect our operations and business.

Table of Contents 
 Even if we are successful in developing quantum computing systems and executing our strategy, competitors in the industry may achieve technological breakthroughs which render our quantum computing systems obsolete or inferior to other products. We may be unable to reduce the cost of developing our quantum computers, which may prevent us from pricing our quantum systems competitively. The quantum computing industry is in its early stages and volatile, and if it does not develop, if it develops more slowly than we expect, if it develops in a manner that does not require use of our quantum computing solutions, if it encounters negative publicity or if our solution does not drive commercial engagement, the growth of our business will be harmed. We and our partners and other third parties on which we rely could suffer disruptions, outages, defects and other performance and quality problems with our quantum computing systems, our production technology partners or with the public cloud, data centers and internet infrastructure on which we rely. If our information technology systems or data, or those of our partners or third parties upon which we rely, are or were compromised, we could experience adverse consequences resulting from such compromise, including but not limited to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse consequences, which may adversely affect our business. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the design and operation of our overall closing and financial reporting processes, and we have in the past and may in the future identify additional material weaknesses. A material weakness over the accounting for complex financial instruments, which has been remediated, resulted in errors in financial statements for prior periods. If we fail to remediate our remaining material weakness, if we identify additional material weaknesses or if we otherwise fail to establish and maintain effective control over financial reporting, it may adversely affect our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results in the future, and may adversely affect investor confidence, our reputation, our ability to raise additional capital and our business operations and financial condition. Our failure to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect and commercialize our proprietary products and technology and cause us to lose our competitive advantage. We have in the past been out of compliance with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq and we may be unable to maintain compliance with such standards. If we fail to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market or fail to cure any future deficiencies, we may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. Sales of our securities, or perceptions of sales, by us or holders of our securities in the public markets or otherwise could cause the market price for our securities to decline and even in such case certain holders of our securities may still have an incentive to sell our securities. Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions, that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable. Unstable market and economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and share price.

 Our Warrants, including our public Warrants, each entitling the holder to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of 11.50 per share, that trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol RGTIW Public Warrants and private placement Warrants, each entitling the holder to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of 11.50 per share Private Warrants ), along with our Sponsor Vesting Shares, are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in value of our Warrants and Sponsor Vesting Shares could have a material effect on our financial results. Our Warrants are exercisable for Common Stock, the exercise of which, or other sales and issuances of Common Stock, would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders. The Warrants may never be in the money, and they may expire worthless. 
 Additional discussion of the risks, uncertainties and other factors described above, as well as other risks material to our business, can be found under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated under Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. In addition, our goals and objectives are aspirational and are not guarantees or promises that such goals and objectives will be met. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Also, these forward-looking statements represent our plans, objectives, estimates, expectations, assumptions, and intentions only as of the date of this filing. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q completely and with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity and performance as well as other events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

 RIGETTI COMPUTING INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS , of the Company (the Common Stock on a one -for-one basis. The SNII Public Warrants and the Private Warrants held by SNII became Warrants for Common Stock. The Company s Common Stock and Public Warrants trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbols RGTI and RGTIW, respectively. The Company determined that Legacy Rigetti was the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination based on an analysis of the criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combination. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Legacy Rigetti issuing stock for the net assets of SNII, accompanied by a recapitalization. The primary asset acquired from SNII was cash that was assumed at historical costs. Separately, the Company also assumed Warrants that were deemed to be derivatives and meet liability classification subject to fair value adjustment measurements upon closing of the Business Combination (the Closing ). No goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded because of the Business Combination. While SNII was the legal acquirer in the Business Combination because Legacy Rigetti was deemed the accounting acquirer, the historical financial statements of Legacy Rigetti became the historical financial statements of the combined company, upon the consummation of the Business Combination. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S and such accounting principles, GAAP for complete financial statements due to the permitted exclusion of certain disclosures for interim reporting. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring items) considered necessary under GAAP for a fair presentation of results for the interim periods presented have been included. As a result of displaying amounts in thousands, rounding differences may exist in the condensed consolidated financial statements and footnote tables. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or for other interim periods or future years.

December 31, 2023 Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair Cost Gains Losses Value Available-for-sale investments: U.S. treasury securities U.S. government agency bonds ) Corporate bonds ) Available-for-sale investments short-term ) The Company invests in highly rated investment grade debt securities. All of the Company s available-for-sale securities have final maturities of one year or less. The Company reviews the individual securities that have unrealized losses on a regular basis. The Company evaluates whether it has the intention to sell any of these investments and whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell any of them before recovery of the amortized cost basis. Neither of these criteria were met as of December 31, 2023. There were securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024. The Company additionally evaluates whether the decline in fair value of the securities below their amortized cost basis is related to credit losses or other factors. Based on this evaluation, the Company determined that the unrealized losses for its available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2023 were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and non-credit-related factors. In addition, none of the Company s available-for-sale securities had been in an unrealized loss position for more than one year. Accordingly, the Company determined that none of the unrealized losses were other-than-temporary, and that recognition of an impairment charge was not required as of December 31, 2023. No available-for-sale securities were sold during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 5 for additional information regarding the fair value of the Company s investments.

The Company also has long-term debt that provides for variable interest, and therefore, the carrying value approximates the fair value. The carrying values of the long-term debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, represent the original principal amounts borrowed, accretion of final payments fees, less principal payments and unamortized debt issuance costs. Long-term debt issued by the Company is classified within Level 2. The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates its fair value given their maturity and variable interest rates. The fair value of the Public Warrants has been measured based on the observable listed prices for such Warrants, a Level 1 measurement. The fair value of the Company s Level 2 financial assets are determined by using inputs based on quoted market prices for similar instruments.

There were no changes in fair value measurement techniques during the year ended December 31, 2023, other than the change in the estimated probability of occurrence for the Forward Warrant Agreement described above. There were transfers in or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, except that in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the derivative liability for Warrants was transferred from Level 3 to Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because such Warrants were converted from Private to Public Warrants. The transfer had a million favorable impact on the Company s net loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

 million. The Forward Warrant Agreement provided for the issuance of a warrant for the purchase of up to an aggregate of shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of . The purchase of the warrant was conditioned upon, among other things, the consummation of the Business Combination and the entry into a collaboration agreement between Rigetti and Ampere. The parties entered into the collaboration agreement in January 2022. Ampere was required to pay million to Rigetti no later than the later of (i) the Closing and (ii) June 30, 2022. On June 30, 2022, pursuant to the Forward Warrant Agreement, the Company issued the warrant to Ampere upon receipt of an aggregate of million (including the exercise price), and upon such payment and issuance, shares of the Company s Common Stock vested under the warrant and were immediately exercised by Ampere pursuant to the terms of the warrant. Ampere was required to pay an additional million to Rigetti no later than the closing date of the listing of Ampere s capital stock on a stock exchange, provided that if the listing had not occurred by the second anniversary of the Forward Warrant Agreement (October 2023), Ampere was not obligated to make the additional payment. Ampere s obligation to make the additional million payment has now expired. The Company filed a registration statement, pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement with Ampere, registering the resale of the initial shares issued under the warrant which was declared effective during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company evaluated the Forward Warrant Agreement as a derivative in conjunction with the guidance of ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . The Company calculated the fair value of the Forward Warrant Agreement at inception using the Forward Contract Pricing methodology. The Forward Warrant Agreement was subsequently re-measured at each reporting period using the Forward Contract Pricing methodology with the change in fair value recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reduced the estimated probability of occurrence for the Forward Warrant Agreement from to because Ampere s obligation to make the additional payment under the Forward Warrant Agreement expired without taking effect. As a result, the Forward Warrant Agreement had no value as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. million in March 2021, million in May 2021, million in November 2021 and million in January 2022 (collectively, the Term Loans ). The outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans as of the Amendment Date was million. There are currently additional amounts available to be drawn under the Amended Loan Agreement. Each Term Loan amortizes in equal monthly installments through following the disbursement date of each Term Loan (each, a Maturity Date ), and bears interest at a rate equal to the greater of or the US Prime Rate plus per annum, payable monthly. The economic terms and cash flows of the Term Loans remain unchanged under the Amended Loan Agreement.

In addition, the Company is required to pay on the respective Maturity Date or the date of an earlier prepayment a final payment fee equal to of the aggregate original principal amount of the Term Loans being repaid, which remains consistent with the Existing Loan Agreement. The final payment fee is being accreted and amortized into interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the loan. The Amended Loan Agreement contains representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Loan Parties (as defined below) and its consolidated subsidiaries, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness and dividends and other distributions, which were amended from the covenants in the Existing Loan Agreement to increase flexibility for the Company. The Amended Loan Agreement also includes events of default, including failure to pay principal, interest or certain other amounts when due, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violation of covenants, specified cross-default and cross-acceleration to other material indebtedness, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, certain undischarged judgments, material invalidity of guarantees or grant of security interest, and change of control, in certain cases subject to certain thresholds and grace periods. If one or more events of default occurs and continues beyond any applicable cure period, the Lender may declare all of the obligations of the Company under the Amended Loan Agreement to be immediately due and payable, which remains consistent with the Existing Loan Agreement. The obligations of the Company under the Amended Loan Agreement are currently guaranteed by the Company s wholly owned subsidiaries, Rigetti Co, LLC and Rigetti Intermediate LLC (which, together with the Company, are collectively referred to as the Loan Parties and each, a Loan Party and will be guaranteed by any future domestic subsidiaries of the Company.

Customer Warrant In February 2020, the Company issued a warrant to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock to a customer in conjunction with a revenue arrangement (the Customer Warrant ). The Customer Warrant has an exercise price of per share and has a -year term to expiration. The Customer Warrant vests upon the achievement of certain performance conditions (i.e., sales milestones) defined in the agreement, and upon a change of control, either or of the then unvested Customer Warrant will become fully vested, dependent on the acquiring party in the change of control transaction. The Customer Warrant can be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis.

As of September 30, 2024, the unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options was million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. Fair Value of Stock Option Grants The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatility for the Company s Common Stock was determined based on a blended average of the historical volatility of the Company s Common Stock, a peer group of similar public companies and the implied volatility from the Company s traded warrants. The Company has not been public for a sufficient length of time to derive expected volatility solely from trading in its common stock. The expected term of stock options granted was calculated using the simplified method, which represents the average of the contractual term and the weighted-average vesting period of the option. The Company uses the simplified method because it does not have sufficient historical option exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The assumed dividend yield is based upon the Company s expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future. The risk-free rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option. In determining the exercise prices for stock options granted, the Company s board of directors has utilized the fair value of the Common Stock as of the grant date. Before the Business Combination, the fair value of the Common Stock had been determined by the board of directors at each award grant date based upon a variety of factors, including the results obtained from an independent third-party valuation, the Company s financial position and historical financial performance, the status of technological developments within the Company, the composition and ability of the current engineering and management team, an evaluation or benchmark of the Company s competition, the current business climate in the marketplace, the illiquid nature of the Company s common stock, arm s-length sales of the Company s capital stock, the effect of the rights and preferences of the preferred shareholders, and the prospects of a liquidity event, among others.

Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview We build quantum computers and the superconducting quantum processors that power them. We believe quantum computing represents one of the most transformative emerging capabilities in the world today. By leveraging quantum mechanics, we believe our quantum computers process information in fundamentally new, more powerful ways than classical computers. When scaled, it is anticipated that these systems will be poised to solve problems of staggering computational complexity at unprecedented speed. With the goal of unlocking this opportunity, we have developed the world s first multi-chip quantum processor for scalable quantum computing systems. We believe that this patented and patent pending, modular chip architecture is the building block for new generations of quantum processors that we expect to achieve a clear advantage over classical computers. Our long-term business model centers on revenue generated from sales of quantum processing units (QPUs) and quantum computing systems made accessible via the cloud in the form of Quantum Computing as a Service QCaaS products. However, the substantial majority of our revenues are derived from development contracts, and we anticipate this market opportunity will continue to represent an important source of revenue for at least the next several years as we work to ramp up sales of QPUs and our QCaaS business. Additionally, we are working to further develop a revenue stream and forging important customer relationships by entering into technology development contracts with various partners. We are a vertically integrated company. We own and operate Fab-1, a dedicated and integrated laboratory and manufacturing facility, through which we own the means of producing our breakthrough multi-chip quantum processor technology. We leverage our chips through a full-stack product development approach, from quantum chip design and manufacturing through cloud delivery. We believe this full-stack development approach offers both the fastest and lowest risk path to building commercially valuable quantum computers. We have been generating revenue since 2018, primarily through partnerships with government agencies and commercial organizations; however, we have not yet generated profits. We have incurred significant operating losses since inception. Our net losses were 75.1 million and 71.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and our net loss was 48.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect to continue to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future as we invest in research, development, and infrastructure consistent with our long-term business strategy. As of September 30, 2024 , we had an accumulated deficit of 401.8 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities should be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs until midway through the first quarter of 2026, based on our current business plan, and expectations and assumptions considering current macroeconomic conditions.

 Accordingly, based on our estimates and current business plan, we expect that we will need to obtain additional capital to fund our research and development efforts and business objectives as currently planned. Our estimate does not assume any additional financing, and there is no assurance that additional financing will be available. If we are unable to raise additional funding when needed and on attractive terms, we may be required to delay, limit, or substantially reduce our quantum computing development efforts. In February 2023, we announced an updated business strategy, including revisions to our technology roadmap. In connection with this updated strategy, we implemented a workforce reduction beginning in February 2023 to focus the organization and our resources on nearer-term strategic priorities and our efforts to achieve narrow quantum advantage. Key achievements in 2023 included the launch of the Ankaa 84-qubit Ankaa -2 system to customers via Rigetti Quantum Cloud Services (QCS). The Ankaa-2 system achieved 98 median 2-qubit fidelity, which represents a 2.5x performance improvement compared to our previous QPUs. We plan to continue working to improve the performance of our QPUs with the goal of reaching at least 99 2-qubit gate fidelity on an anticipated Ankaa-3 84-qubit system by the end of 2024. We plan to introduce a new modular system architecture in 2025. By mid-year 2025, we expect to release a 36-qubit system based on four 9-qubit chips tiled together with a targeted 99.5 median 2-qubit fidelity. By the end of 2025, we expect to release a system with over 100 qubits with a targeted 99.5 median 2-qubit fidelity. We plan to develop Lyra , an anticipated 336-quibit system, thereafter. We also plan to continue to pursue sales of Novera , our first commercially available QPU launched in 2023, which features a 9-qubit chip, tunable couplers for fast 2-qubit operations and a 5-qubit chip for testing single-qubit operations. We believe that this business plan should enable us to concentrate our software application development strategy on what we believe to be the highest likelihood applications for demonstrating nearer term narrow quantum advantage. In February 2023, the reduction in the workforce impacted approximately 50 employees or 28 of our then workforce. We began implementing activities with respect to the revised business plan and reduction in workforce in February 2023. Affected employees were offered separation benefits, including severance payments and temporary healthcare coverage assistance. We incurred a 1.0 million restructuring charge in the three months ended March 31, 2023, for severance payments and temporary healthcare coverage for affected employees. In addition to the restructuring charge, we also incurred 1.0 million of expenses for contractual severance benefits related to executive officers of the Company that were terminated in the three months ended March 31, 2023. Macroeconomic Considerations Unfavorable conditions in the economy in the United States and abroad may negatively affect the growth of our business and have affected our results of operations. For example, macroeconomic events, including rising inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates, the ongoing military conflict involving Russia and Ukraine and sanctions related thereto, the state of war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah and the related risk of a larger conflict have led to economic uncertainty globally. The effect of macroeconomic conditions may not be fully reflected in the results of operations until future periods. If, however, economic uncertainty increases or the global economy worsens, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. For further discussion of the potential impacts of macroeconomic events on our business, financial condition, and operating results, see the section titled Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including the risk factor titled Unstable market and economic conditions have had and may continue to have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and share price.

Table of Contents 
 We have experienced and may experience further increases in the cost of raw materials, component parts, and labor, which we largely attribute to inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates, high demand, and supply chain restraints. Rising costs and supply chain constraints have been further exacerbated by the ongoing military conflict involving Russia and Ukraine and sanctions related thereto, the state of war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah and the related risk of a larger conflict. We expect these increased costs will persist for the foreseeable future and may increase. Additionally, inflation and rising interest rates may result in an economic recession globally or in the U.S., which could lead to a reduction in product demand, a decrease in corporate capital expenditures, prolonged unemployment, labor shortages, reduction in consumer confidence, adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic events, or any similar negative economic condition. Economic conditions in some parts of the world have been worsening, with disruptions to, and volatility and uncertainty in, the credit and financial markets in the U.S. and worldwide resulting from uncertainty in the levels of future economic activity, inflation and interest rates . It is not possible at this time to estimate the long-term impact that these and related events could have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If these conditions persist and deepen, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, or our liquidity could otherwise be impacted. If we are unable to raise capital when needed and on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs and other efforts. However, like many other companies, we are continuing to take actions to monitor our operations to account for the increases in the cost of capital. Specifically, this includes efforts to enhance our operational efficiency, including with respect to capital expenditures, maximize our R D productivity spend through strategic collaborations, and being highly selective in hiring top-tier talent. Key Components of Results of Operations Revenue We generate revenue through our development contracts, as well as from our sales of QPUs, and our QCaaS offerings and other services including training and provision of quantum computing components. Development contracts are generally multi-year, non-recurring arrangements pursuant to which we provide professional services regarding collaborative research in practical applications of quantum computing to technology and business problems within the customer s industry or organization and assists the customer in developing quantum algorithms and applications to assist customers in areas of business interest. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of all direct and indirect costs associated with sales of QPUs, QCaaS offerings and development contracts and other services, including materials, employee costs for program management and personnel associated with the delivery of goods and services to customers, and sub-contract costs for work performed by third parties. Cost of revenue also includes an allocation of facility costs, depreciation and amortization directly related to the development contracts and QCaaS offerings and other services. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses primarily consist of research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses.

Table of Contents 
 Research and Development Research and development expenses include compensation, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, outside consultant fees, facility costs, depreciation and amortization, materials and components purchased for research and development. We expect research and development expenses to increase as we continue to invest in quantum computing and the superconducting quantum processors needed for quantum computers. We do not currently capitalize any research and development expenditures. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses include compensation, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, insurance, facility costs, professional service fees, and other general overhead costs other than those associated with sales of QPUs and providing development contracts, QCaaS offerings and other services. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase as we grow our business, particularly to the extent we achieve narrow and broad quantum advantage, and anticipate subsequently enhancing our product and service offerings, expanding our customer base, and implementing new marketing strategies. Restructuring In February 2023, we announced an updated business strategy, including revisions to our technology roadmap. In connection with this updated strategy, we implemented a workforce reduction in order to focus the organization and its resources on nearer-term strategic priorities. The reduction in the workforce impacted approximately 50 employees or approximately 28 of our then workforce. Affected employees were offered separation benefits, including severance payments and temporary healthcare coverage assistance. Provision for Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.

The decreases were due to lower QCaaS revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.8 million and 1.8 million, respectively, offset in part by higher revenue from development contracts and sales of QPUs. Our development contracts are typically fixed price milestone or cost share-based contracts and the timing and amounts of revenue recognized in any given period will vary significantly based on the delivery of the associated milestones and/or the work performed. The timing and delivery of sales of QPUs and QCaaS will also vary and impact revenue in any given quarterly or annual period. Revenue is expected to vary in terms of timing and size, resulting in significant fluctuations in revenue levels in future periods. For the next few years, we expect much of our revenue to be generated from development contracts and anticipated sales of on-premises QPUs. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue increased by 0.3 million and 1.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increases in cost of revenue are primarily due to changes in the composition of our revenue and variability in the pricing and terms of our development contracts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into a new contract to deliver a 24-qubit quantum computing system having higher costs and a lower gross margin profile than most of our other contracts. The increase in cost of revenue resulting from the unfavorable mix was partially offset by the impact of lower revenue. We expect that cost of revenue and total gross profit as a percentage of revenue will vary in future quarterly and annual periods due to changes in the composition of our revenue and variability in the pricing and terms of our development contracts.

 Operating Expenses Research and Development Research and development expenses decreased by 0.3 million and 3.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, is mainly due to a 0.8 million reduction in IT costs due to systems rationalization and a 0.6 million reduction in stock-based compensation expenses, partially offset by a 0.5 million increase in facilities costs due to higher property and use taxes, and a 0.5 million increase in salaries and employee related costs due to additional salaries and headcount. All other research and development costs increased by a cumulative 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is largely due to a 2.0 million decrease in salaries and employee related costs due to our February 2023 restructuring and because more engineering time was used to deliver revenue, a 2.6 million decrease in IT costs due to systems rationalization and a 1.0 million reduction in depreciation expense. These decreases were offset in part by an increase in facilities costs of 1.6 million due to higher property and use tax payments. All other research and development costs increased by a cumulative 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We anticipate that R D expenditures will grow in the future as we continue to focus on our technology roadmap and long-term goal of achieving broad quantum advantage. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 0.2 million and 2.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to 1.1 million of expense recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2023 for the Ampere Forward Agreement, which expired in October 2023. The reduction for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to the Ampere Forward Agreement was mostly offset by higher expenses for salaries, stock-based compensation and IT expenses. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to 2.2 million of expense recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for the Ampere Forward Agreement and an impairment charge of 0.8 million for deferred offering costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expenses of 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Stock compensation expenses were favorably impacted during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to forfeitures resulting from the February 2023 restructuring. All other expenses decreased by a cumulative 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase over the longer term, particularly after we potentially achieve quantum advantage, and plan to subsequently enhance our sales and service offerings, expand our customer base, and implement new marketing strategies.

 Restructuring In February 2023, we announced an updated business strategy, including revisions to our technology roadmap. In connection with this updated strategy, we implemented a workforce reduction in order to focus the organization and our resources on nearer-term strategic priorities. The reduction in the workforce impacted approximately 50 employees or approximately 28 of our then workforce. Affected employees were offered separation benefits, including severance payments and temporary healthcare coverage assistance. We began implementing activities with respect to our revised business plan, updated technology roadmap and reduction in workforce in February 2023, resulting in a 1.0 million restructuring charge for the three months ended March 31, 2023. No further restructuring charges related to this action are expected. Other income and (expense), net Interest expense Our outstanding debt carries a variable rate of interest. Interest expenses decreased by 0.7 million and 1.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The reduction in interest expense was due to principal repayments and the lower outstanding principal throughout the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income Interest income was 1.2 million and 3.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, down from 1.3 million and 3.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in interest income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, is due to lower balances of invested cash and available-for-sale investments, offset in part by higher rates of interest earned on our investments. Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities A discussion of the change in the fair value of the warrant liabilities is included in Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The change in fair value of our warrant liabilities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a gain of 1.2 million and 0.7 million, respectively. The change in fair value of our warrant liabilities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was a loss of 3.4 million and 4.3 million , respectively. The change in fair value for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the change in our stock price and related share price volatility. Change in Fair Value of Earn-Out Liabilities A discussion of the change in the fair value of the earn-out liabilities is included in Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The change in fair value of our earn-out liabilities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a gain of 0.8 million and 0.5 million, respectively. The change in fair value of our earn-out liabilities three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was a loss of 1.7 million and 2.4 million, respectively. The change in fair value for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the change in our stock price and related share price volatility.

 Provision for Income Taxes We did not record income tax expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 due to the Company s loss position and full valuation allowance. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows since inception. Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the Business Combination (see Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023), issuance of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, convertible notes, venture backed debt and revenues. Our net losses were 75.1 million and 71.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and our net loss was 48.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect to continue to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future as we invest in research, development, and infrastructure consistent with our long-term business strategy. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 401.8 million. We received net proceeds of 225.6 million from the closing of the Business Combination on March 2, 2022. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we received proceeds of 12.8 million, from the sale of 10,056,799 shares of our common stock to B. Riley under a Purchase Agreement which has since terminated, because there are no remaining shares available for sale under the agreement. On March 15, 2024, we entered into an ATM Sales Agreement pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 100,000,000, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the ATM Sales Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds of 38.8 million from the sale of 30,718,121 shares of our common stock under the ATM sales agreement. We believe that our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments should be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months, and to midway through the first quarter of 2026, based on our current business plan, and expectations and assumptions considering current macroeconomic conditions. Based on our estimates and current business plan, we expect that we will need to obtain additional capital to fund our research and development efforts and business objectives as currently planned. Our estimate does not assume any additional financing and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available. If we are unable to raise additional funding when needed and on attractive terms, we may be required to delay, limit or substantially reduce our quantum computing development efforts. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, and future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those described in the section under Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated under Part II Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Inflation and rising interest rates may result in an economic recession globally or in the U.S., which could lead to a reduction in product demand, a decrease in corporate capital expenditures, prolonged unemployment, labor shortages, reduction in consumer confidence, adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic events, or any similar negative economic condition. Economic conditions in some parts of the world have been worsening, with disruptions to, and volatility and uncertainty in, the credit and financial markets in the U.S. and worldwide resulting from the effects of inflation and rising interest rates. These conditions have been further exacerbated by recent and potential future disruptions due to the ongoing military conflict involving Russia and Ukraine and sanctions related thereto, the state of war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah and the related risk of a larger conflict. It is not possible at this time to estimate the long-term impact that these and related events could have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If these conditions persist and deepen, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, or our liquidity could otherwise be impacted.

 If we are unable to raise capital when needed and on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs and/or other efforts. A recession or additional market corrections resulting from the impact of difficult macroeconomic conditions or disruption could materially affect our business and the value of our securities. Our cash requirements include employee-related costs such as salaries and benefits; materials and components for research and development; working capital requirements; capital expenditures for our quantum chip fabrication facility; quantum computing refrigerators and other requirements; planned development of multiple generations of quantum processors; anticipated investments to scale our operations in the future; and strategic collaborative arrangements and investments. We will require a significant amount of cash for expenditure as we invest in ongoing research and development and business operations. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of QPUs, our development contracts and other services, including our QCaaS offerings, we expect to finance our cash needs primarily through our existing cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments, potential securities financings or other capital sources. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be, or could be, diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed and on attractive terms, we may be required to delay, limit, or substantially reduce our quantum computing development efforts. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those described in the section under Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated under Part II Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Furthermore, we currently have on file with the SEC an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which allows us to offer and sell up to an aggregate amount of 250.0 million of any combination of common stock, common stock or preferred stock upon conversion of debt securities, common stock upon conversion of preferred stock, or common stock, preferred stock or debt securities upon exercise of warrants from time to time, pursuant to which we have entered into an ATM offering for the sale of up to an aggregate amount of 100 million of common stock from time to time, of which 60.2 million of common stock remains available for sale as of the date hereof. Amended Loan Agreement Trinity Capital As of September 30, 2024, the total principal amount outstanding under the Amended Loan Agreement was 12.9 million. The Amended Loan Agreement bears interest at a rate equal to the greater of 11 or the US Prime Rate plus 7.50 per annum, payable monthly, and is secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of our assets. Our cash commitments as of September 30, 2024 were primarily as follows (in thousands): 

Total Short-term Long-term Financing obligations 12,885 11,080 1,805 Estimated cash interest on financing obligations 2,011 1,621 390 Operating lease 10,947 2,217 8,730 25,843 14,918 10,925 Financing obligations consist of payments related to the Amended Loan Agreement with Trinity Capital. Operating lease obligations consist of obligations under non-cancelable operating leases for our offices, facilities and equipment. The table above does not include amounts owed for purchases of capital equipment; supplies; materials; or fixed or minimum services under non-cancelable contracts.

 Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our ability to achieve significant growth to offset expenditures related to research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. Our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth in personnel-related expenditures and fluctuations in accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 42.1 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of 48.0 million, partially offset by non-cash expenses totaling 13.2 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities had a 7.2 million negative impact on net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 38.2 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of 62.5 million, partially offset by non-cash charges totaling 24.9 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities had a minimal impact on net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in operating activities increased by 3.9 million to 42.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , from 38.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net loss decreased by 14.5 million to 48.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Non-cash charges impacting our net loss decreased by 11.8 million to 13.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 24.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating assets and liabilities had a 6.7 million unfavorable impact on the change in cash used in operating activities during nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 0.8 million, resulting from 98.5 million of purchases of available-for-sale securities and 9.8 million of purchases of property and equipment, offset in part by 107.5 million of maturities of available-for-sale securities. Cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 11.5 million, resulting from 98.1 million of maturities of available-for -sale securities, partially offset by 7.5 million of purchases of property and equipment and 79.0 million of purchases of available-for-sale securities. Investments in property and equipment relate primarily to process computing equipment, quantum computing refrigerators, and development tools for our chip fabrication facility. Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 12.3 million when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment and fluctuations in the level of investment in available-for-sale securities. Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 41.8 million. We received net proceeds of 12.8 million from the sale of 10,056,799 shares of common stock to B. Riley through our prior Purchase Agreement and net proceeds of 38.8 million from the sale of 30,718,121 shares of common stock pursuant to our ATM program. Proceeds from the sale of common stock were offset in part by principal payments of 9.5 million under the Amended Loan Agreement with Trinity Capital and payments of 0.5 million for deferred offering costs. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 10.5 million, reflecting 15.1 million of proceeds from the sale of 8.2 million shares of common stock to B. Riley through the Purchase Agreement, and 1.0 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants, offset in part by principal payments of 5.4 million under the Amended Loan Agreement and payments of 0.1 million for deferred financing costs.

Table of Contents 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 31.2 million when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was primarily due to a 36.6 million increase in proceeds from the sale of common stock through our prior Purchase Agreement with B. Riley and our ATM program in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, offset in part by a 4.1 million increase in principal payments under the Amended Loan Agreement and a reduction in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants. We expect to satisfy our cash needs primarily through on-hand cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments, the sale of common stock through the ATM Agreement, subject to market and other conditions, and other potential securities financings or capital sources. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgements and Estimates This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We also make estimates and assumptions pertaining to revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates from those described under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we have disclosed our critical accounting estimates that we believe have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2024 included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status In April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Therefore, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Following the Business Combination, we still qualify as an emerging growth company and plan to take advantage of the extended transition period that emerging growth company status permits. During the extended transition period, it may be difficult or impossible to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that complies with public company effective dates for accounting standard updates because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. We will remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2026, the last day of our first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of SNII s initial public offering, (b) the last date of our fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.24 billion, (c) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC with at least 700.0 million of outstanding securities held by non-affiliates or (d) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the previous three years.

 We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as the market value of our voting and non-voting Common Stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our voting and non-voting Common Stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness described below related to our overall closing and financial reporting processes. We have added additional controls over our year-end and quarter-end closing processes, which are still being tested. The material weakness related to our year-end and quarter-end overall closing and financial reporting processes will not be considered remediated until such time as management has concluded, through testing, that the additional controls which have been implemented are effective. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim condensed consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. After giving full consideration to the material weakness and the additional procedures that we performed, management has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP; however, the material weakness could have resulted in a misstatement of account balances or disclosures that would be considered material to the annual or interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Material Weakness As previously disclosed, in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the design and operation of our overall closing and financial reporting processes, including the timely preparation of account reconciliations, effective segregation of duties, particularly with respect to change management and logical access over IT systems, and a lack of timely review over the financial statement close process. We have concluded that this material weakness is due to the fact that, between the date the Company went public pursuant to the Business Combination and December 31, 2022, the Company had limited resources and did not have the necessary business processes and related internal controls formally designed and implemented coupled with the appropriate resources with the appropriate level of experience and technical expertise to oversee our closing and financial reporting processes. This material weakness continued to exist as of September 30, 2024 because the necessary controls to remediate the material weakness have not been sufficiently tested. 

 44 

Table of Contents 
 Remediation Plan Our remediation plan related to the material weakness over our overall closing and financial reporting processes included: hiring sufficient personnel with technical accounting and financial reporting experience to augment our current staff, to achieve appropriate segregation of duties and to improve the effectiveness of our closing and financial reporting processes; addressing the lack of segregation of duties for change management and logical access over IT systems; and implementing improved accounting and financial reporting procedures and systems to improve the completeness, timeliness and accuracy of our financial reporting and disclosures, including the assessment of more judgmental areas of accounting. This material weakness will not be considered remediated unless and until such time as management designs and implements effective controls that operate for a sufficient length of time and concludes, through testing, that the controls are effective. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. As management continues to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine it is necessary to take additional measures or implement new controls to address the material weakness. Until the controls have been operating for a sufficient length of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively, the material weakness described above will continue to exist. Management is monitoring the progress of the remediation plan and reports regularly to the audit committee of the board of directors on the progress and results of the remediation plan, including the identification, status and resolution of internal control deficiencies. We can provide no assurance that the measures we have taken will remediate the material weakness identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, in the future these controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have taken the actions described above to remediate the material weakness relating to our internal controls over financial reporting as described above. Other than the remediation efforts described above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we may be subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. While the results of any litigation or other legal proceedings are uncertain, we are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is both probable that we will incur the loss and when we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Below we are providing, in supplemental form, changes to our risk factors from those previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 provide additional discussion regarding these supplemental risks and we encourage you to read and carefully consider all of the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, together with the below, for a more complete understanding of the risks and uncertainties material to our business. Any future generations of hardware and software developed to demonstrate narrow quantum advantage and broad quantum advantage, each of which is an important anticipated milestone for our technology roadmap and commercialization, may not occur on our anticipated timeline or at all. We plan to continue working to improve the performance of our QPUs with the goal of reaching at least 99 2-qubit gate fidelity on an anticipated Ankaa-3 84-qubit system by the end of 2024. We plan to introduce a new modular system architecture in 2025. By mid-year 2025, we expect to release a 36-qubit system based on four 9-qubit chips tiled together with a targeted 99.5 median 2-qubit fidelity. By the end of 2025, we expect to release a system with over 100 qubits with a targeted 99.5 median 2-qubit fidelity. We plan to develop Lyra , an anticipated 336-qubit system, thereafter. Our successful execution of our technology roadmap is based on the development of multiple generations of quantum computing systems, including hardware that demonstrates narrow quantum advantage and broad quantum advantage, and the achievement of our targeted fidelities and targeted increase in the number of qubits, each of which is an important anticipated milestone for our technology roadmap and commercialization. The future success of our technology roadmap will depend upon our ability to continue to increase the number of qubits and decrease error rates in each subsequent generation of our quantum computer. If we are unable to achieve the increase in the number of qubits or decrease in error rates on the timeframe that we anticipate, the availability of future generations of quantum computer systems may be materially delayed, or may never occur. In the past we have failed to meet publicly announced milestones and we may fail to meet projected milestones in the future. If our technology roadmap is delayed or never achieved, this would have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is subject to federal laws regarding data protection, privacy, and information security, as well as confidentiality obligations under various agreements, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our business operations are subject to the evolving requirements of the U.S. DoD Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program. CMMC mandates third-party assessments for companies working with U.S. government customers in order to verify adherence to specific cybersecurity standards which may be a prerequisite for certain new contract awards with DoD and civilian government agencies. While we are committed to implementing cybersecurity best practices, there is risk associated with not achieving certain standards in a timely manner or at all. These risks include the inability to bid on new contracts or to obtain follow-on awards for existing U.S. government work, and penalties for noncompliance which could negatively impact our revenue, profitability, and cash flow. Furthermore, compliance with CMMC may extend to our subcontractors and certain vendors which could also pose challenges for our supply chain. The associated costs of CMMC compliance are significant and may increase in the future, potentially affecting our operating results. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS None.
