 programs that were grouped as a single identifiable in-process research development IPR D asset. Traws Pharma is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company aiming to address unmet medical needs in respiratory viral diseases and cancer. The viral respiratory disease program includes an oral inhibitor drug candidate of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (3CL protease) and an oral antiviral drug candidate for influenza. In the cancer program, Traws Pharma is developing the novel, proprietary multi-kinase CDK2/4/6 inhibitor narazaciclib for refractory endometrial cancer and potentially for other cancers. Liquidity The Company has incurred recurring operating losses since inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of , and as of September 30, 2024 the Company had an accumulated deficit of . The Company anticipates that operating losses will continue for the foreseeable future due to, among other things, costs related to research, development of its product candidates and its preclinical programs, strategic alliances and its administrative organization. At September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of . Based on current projections, the Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its ongoing trials and operations into the first quarter of 2025; therefore, it does not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to support its operations for at least the 12 months following the date that these financial statements are issued. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern through the one-year period after the date that the financial statements are issued. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates and the risks associated with the research, development, and commercialization of biotechnology products, the Company may have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company's operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to the Company. The Company will require substantial additional financing to fund its ongoing clinical trials and operations, and to continue to execute its strategy. To alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, management plans to explore various dilutive and non-dilutive sources of funding, including equity financings, strategic alliances, business development and other sources. The future success of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional funding. The failure to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms when needed would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be successful in obtaining such funding in sufficient amounts, on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. On September 24, 2024, the Company received a letter from The Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq Staff (the Staff stating that the Company had not been able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and that the Staff had determined to seek to delist the Company s securities from Nasdaq. On October 29, 2024, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that the Company had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement because the Company s common stock had a minimum closing price of at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days.

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company utilizes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuations used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

 Trawsfynydd options exchanged in connection with acquisition Granted Forfeitures/adjustments ) Expired ) Balance, September 30, 2024 Exercisable at September 30, 2024 The Company accounts for all stock-based payments made to employees, non-employees and directors using an option pricing model for estimating fair value. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized for the portion that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to the Company using the straight-line single option method. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options at the grant date. The Black-Scholes model requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions, assumptions related to the expected price volatility of the common stock, the period during which the options will be outstanding, the rate of return on risk-free investments and the expected dividend yield for the Company s stock. As of September 30, 2024, there was of unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years. The weighted-average assumptions underlying the Black-Scholes calculation of grant date fair value of stock options include the following: Expected volatility Expected term years years Expected dividend yield Weighted average grant date fair value The weighted-average valuation assumptions were determined as follows: Risk-free interest rate: The Company based the risk-free interest rate on the interest rate payable on U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the time of grant for a period that is commensurate with the assumed expected option term. 
 Expected term of options: Due to its lack of sufficient historical data, the Company estimates the expected life of its employee stock options using the simplified method, as prescribed in Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, whereby the expected life equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option.

 Overview The Company s net losses were 136.6 million and 14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 619.2 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates, even if milestones under our license and collaboration agreements may be met. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 5.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. On April 1, 2024, in connection with the Merger described below, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement for the sale of common and preferred stock to TPAV, LLC, an affiliate of Torrey Pines, and OrbiMed Private Investments VIII, LP, an affiliate of OrbiMed Advisors (the Investors and raised gross proceeds of 14 million. Based on current projections, we do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents as of the date of this report to support our operations for at least the 12 months following the date that these financial statements are issued. Accordingly, substantial doubt exists with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. We are exploring various sources of funding for development and applying for regulatory approval of our research compounds as well as for our ongoing operations. If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations and alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, which may include existing collaboration partners, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in obtaining such financing in sufficient amounts, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will obtain approvals necessary to market our product candidates or achieve profitability or sustainable, positive cash flow. If we are unable to successfully raise sufficient additional capital, through future financings or through strategic and collaborative arrangements, we will not have sufficient cash to fund our ongoing trials and operations. Our Portfolio/ Product Candidates/ Compounds We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company aiming to address unmet medical needs in respiratory viral diseases and cancer. Following the closing of the Merger described below in which we acquired Trawsfynydd Therapeutics, Inc. on April 1, 2024, we are advancing the development of four clinical programs: Tivoxavir marboxil (TRX100), which we acquired as part of the Merger, is a small molecule cap- dependent endonuclease inhibitor. Cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN) is an enzyme that is important for influenza virus replication. TRX100 is intended to inhibit CEN and, thus, is intended to impede influenza virus replication including, the influenza A or B viral strains and bird flu viral strains. It is Traws Pharma s intention to develop TRX100 as an oral dose given only once for potential treatment and prophylaxis of seasonal influenza or bird flu.

 The first-in-man clinical study of TRX100 (designated AV5124 in a previous study) was performed from May to September of 2023 in Russia. The study sponsor was Pharmasyntez, JSC. Traws Pharma has the right to use the data resulting from the study outside of Russia and the Eurasian Economic Community countries. The trial was a single ascending dose study, and, as such, each study participant only received one dose of TRX100. The study consisted of four dose cohorts that received 20, 40, 80 or 120 mg TRX100 delivered as 20 mg strength tablets, or placebo. The study enrolled 28 healthy males ages 18-45 years who received either the study drug or placebo. The primary study endpoint was measurement of the safety and tolerability of single drug doses in healthy volunteers. The secondary endpoint was the measurement of pharmacokinetic parameters of single drug doses in healthy volunteers on an empty stomach or after a meal. In the study, one subject who received a single 40 mg dose of the study drug, experienced two adverse events (AEs). This subject experienced hyperglycemia, which was deemed to be mild believed probably related to TRX100, and erosive gastritis with complications in the form of severe iron deficiency anemia, which was considered to be a serious adverse event (SAE) believed unlikely to be related (doubtful per the protocol) to the study drug. There were no other AEs in the trial, including at higher doses. The pharmacokinetic measurements indicated a food effect for TRX100, with increased exposure when drug was taken after a meal, but otherwise showed increasing exposure with increasing dose. Traws Pharma is further advancing the development of TRX100 with a Traws Pharma sponsored Phase 1 randomized, blinded, and placebo-controlled study in Australia that was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee. To date this study enrolled three cohorts of 8 participants, with 6 participants randomized to receive study drug and 2 participants assigned to receive placebo in each cohort. Participants are required to be healthy males or females ages 18-45 years. Participants took either one dose of the study drug or one dose of placebo, depending on the group they were assigned to. The dose levels that were investigated were 80, 120, and 240 mg, taken via oral capsules; one additional dose of 480 mg will be studied . The primary endpoint is the measurement of safety and tolerability, and the secondary and other endpoints include the determination of the drug pharmacokinetic profile. Topline data for the first three doses showed good overall tolerability and a pharmacokinetic profile that appears to support the potential use of TRX100 as a one-time treatment for influenza. No treatment related adverse events were reported during the study so far. Topline data from this study showed that a single dose of TRX100 maintained plasma drug levels consistently above the EC 90 and within the predicted therapeutic window for more than 20 days. We plan to complete the Phase 1 trial in Australia, initiate a Phase 2 study in the first half of 2025, and to interact with BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in the USA for potential collaboration and funding for the development of the compound in influenza and bird flu. Ratutrelvir (TRX01), which we acquired as part of the Merger, is an inhibitor of the main protease (also known as 3CL protease) of the SAR-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent in COVID19. The main protease is an essential component in the mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 replication. TRX01 is intended to inhibit this protease and reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus replication. In vitro laboratory tests that measured the impact of TRX01 on SARS-CoV-2 replication, demonstrated that TRX01 inhibited the replication of viral isolates of the original SARS-CoV-2 isolates, and viral variants in the delta and omicron types. Based on preclinical animal studies, we intend to develop TRX01 without co-administration of a human cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitor such as ritonavir.

 TRX01 was studied in a Phase 1 clinical trial that included single and multiple ascending dose phases. Participants were required to be healthy males or females ages 18-45 years. The primary endpoint of the study was the measurement of safety and tolerability, and the secondary endpoint included the determination of the drug pharmacokinetic profile. The Phase 1 trial was conducted in Australia. It was sponsored by Traws Pharma and was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee. The trial administered either the study drug or placebo to 40 participants in the single ascending dose phase, which included 5 cohorts with 8 participants in each cohort (6 received study drug and two received placebo). Subjects in the single ascending dose phase received one oral dose of the study drug or placebo, depending on their assigned group. The single ascending dose portion of the study assessed oral TRX01 at 15, 50, 150, 300 and 600 mg doses. Subjects in the multiple ascending dose phase received a daily single oral dose of 150 mg or 600 mg (6 active and 2 placebo) for 10 consecutive days. The study was completed in September 2024. Topline data from the study showed no treatment related adverse events reported up to the highest dose. Topline data also showed that once-daily administration of TRX01 for 10 consecutive days maintained plasma drug levels within the predicted therapeutic window for 12 days. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in the first half of 2025. Narazaciclib, is our oral CDK4-plus inhibitor intended initially to treat, breast low grade endometrioid endometrial cancer, and other cancers. Narazaciclib is a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor targeting multiple cyclin- dependent kinases (CDK s), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), related protein kinase 5 (ARK5), and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) at low nM concentrations, as well as other tyrosine kinases believed to drive tumor cell proliferation, survival and metastasis. We initiated a multi-center Phase 1/2a trial evaluating narazaciclib in combination with letrozole as a second or third-line therapy for recurrent metastatic low-grade endometrioid endometrial cancer in the first calendar quarter of 2023. In this study, both narazaciclib and letrozole are administered orally in the ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation phase before potentially moving to a Phase 2 expansion cohort designed to enroll approximately 30 patients with low grade endometrioid endometrial cancer. For the Phase 1 portion patients with endometrial cancer and other gynecological malignancies that are amenable to treatment with hormonal therapy were included. Patients received escalating doses of narazaciclib given once daily continuously. The objectives of this study were to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination for future studies and characterize the safety profile of the combination treatment. The RP2D of narazaciclib in combination with letrozole in low grade endometrioid endometrial cancers has been identified. Another Phase 1 study of narazaciclib as a monotherapy has also been conducted in patients with relapsed and/or refractory advanced cancer. The objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of repeated daily dosing of narazaciclib in these patients. The analysis of both studies is ongoing. Two investigator-initiated studies are planned to start in the USA, one in patients with refractory breast cancer and one in patients with multiple myeloma. Narazaciclib is also being developed in greater China, under a 2017 license agreement between our company and HanX Biopharmaceuticals Inc. (HanX.) The development in greater China is entirely sponsored by HanX. The compound is being studied in China in a clinical trial of patients with advanced breast cancer and other tumors. Our objective for narazaciclib is to establish additional partnerships for further development of the compound. Rigosertib is our second asset in oncology. It has been studied both alone and in combination with other therapeutics in various cancers. Rigosertib is currently being studied in investigator initiated trials for epidermolysis bullosa-associated squamous cell carcinoma. The Company is also making rigosertib available to patients under country specific compassionate use regulations. We are currently pursuing orphan drug designation for rigosertib for epidermolysis bullosa-associated squamous cell carcinoma with the FDA. Our objective for this program is to establish partnerships for the development of rigosertib in this indication.

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses, revenue recognition, deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, acquired in-process research and development and the contingent value rights. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes in the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates as discussed in the Company s Annual Report. Accounting policies and estimates related to the merger are discussed in this report. Results of Operations Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Revenue 57,000 57,000 Operating expenses: In-process research and development Research and development 5,113,000 2,460,000 (2,653,000) General and administrative 3,480,000 2,686,000 (794,000) Total operating expenses 8,593,000 5,146,000 (3,447,000) Loss from operations (8,536,000) (5,089,000) (3,447,000) Other income, net 61,000 350,000 (289,000) Net loss (8,475,000) (4,739,000) (3,736,000) Revenues Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were consistent with the three months ended September 30, 2023, and were due to the recognition of deferred revenue from our collaboration with SymBio.

 Research and development expenses Research and development expenses increased by 2.7 million, or 108 , to 5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to the initiation and completion of our Phase 1 study for TRX100 in Australia, partially offset by the reductions in research and development costs attributable to the Australian tax incentive receivable. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses increased 0.8 million, or 30 , to 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to a 1.2 million increase in professional and consulting fees associated with seeking strategic alternatives for our investors. This increase was offset by a 0.7 million decrease in public company costs. Other income, net Other income, net, was income of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was caused by lower interest income in the 2024 period due to lower cash balances. Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Revenue 170,000 170,000 Operating expenses: In-process research and development 117,464,000 (117,464,000) Research and development 10,989,000 8,996,000 (1,993,000) General and administrative 8,813,000 7,010,000 (1,803,000) Total operating expenses 137,266,000 16,006,000 (121,260,000) Loss from operations (137,096,000) (15,836,000) (121,260,000) Other income, net 495,000 1,072,000 (577,000) Net loss (136,601,000) (14,764,000) (121,837,000) Revenues Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were consistent with the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and were due to the recognition of deferred revenue from our collaboration with SymBio. Acquired in-process research and development In connection with the acquisition of Trawsfynydd, we recognized a non-cash in-process research and development expense of 117.5 million related to the acquired virology programs that had no alternative future use at the time of acquisition which requires immediate expense recognition. Research and development expenses Research and development expenses increased by 2.0 million, or 22 , to 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily related to a 4.4 million increase in consulting fees associated with our acquired virology programs and a 1 million increase in personnel related expenses attributable the restructuring activities. In connection with the acquisition of Trawsfynydd we initiated and completed our Phase 1 study for TRX100 in Australia. These increases were offset by a 2.0 million decrease in manufacturing and a 1.0 million decrease in preclinical and clinical costs.

 General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses increased 1.8 million, or 26 , to 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was attributable to a 2.3 million increase in additional consulting fees in connection with seeking strategic alternatives for our investors and increases in personnel related expenses attributable to our restructuring activities in April 2024. These increases were offset by lower public company costs and insurance costs. Other income, net Other income, net, was income of 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was caused by lower interest income in the 2024 period due to lower cash balances. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, the Company has incurred net losses and experienced negative cash flows from our operations. The Company incurred net losses of 136.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of which 117.5 million was attributable to non-cash expense recognition associated with the acquired in-process research and development from Trawsfynydd in April 2024. The Company s operating activities used 25.8 million and 13.5 million of net cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 619.2 million, working capital of 0.6 million, and cash and cash equivalents of 5.4 million. On April 1, 2024, in connection with the Merger described above, the Company entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement and raised gross proceeds of 14 million. Based on current projections, and including the proceeds received in the private placement, we do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents as of the date of this report to support our operations for at least the 12 months following the date that these financial statements are issued. Accordingly, substantial doubt exists with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates and the risks associated with the research, development, and commercialization of biotechnology products, we may have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us. We will require substantial additional financing to fund our ongoing clinical trials and operations, and to continue to execute our strategy. To alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, we plan to explore various dilutive and non-dilutive sources of funding, including equity financings, strategic alliances, business development and other sources. The future success of the Company is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional funding. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in obtaining such funding in sufficient amounts, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The failure to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, without limitation, our ability to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements. On August 23, 2024, the Company was notified by the Staff that the Company is no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq The Company attended a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Nasdaq Panel on November 14, 2024 to present its plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement. If we are unable to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common Stock could be delisted, which could affect our Common Stock's market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

 Cash Flows The following table summarizes the Company s cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (25,752,000) (13,502,000) Investing activities (3,648,000) (14,000) Financing activities 13,999,000 Effect of foreign currency translation (10,000) 3,000 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (15,411,000) (13,513,000) Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 25.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of a net loss of 136.6 million and a 7.7 million change in operating assets and liabilities. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities included a net decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 5.8 million due to timing of invoices and payments to our vendors. These operating uses of cash were offset by 118.5 million in non-cash charges primarily attributable to the immediate expensing of in-process research and development acquired in connection with the acquisition of Trawsfynydd of 117.5 million and 1.1 million related to stock-based compensation expense. Net cash used in operating activities was 13.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted primarily of a net loss of 14.8 million, including 1.0 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and depreciation expense. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net increase in cash of 0.3 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in accounts payable of 2.3 million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of 0.7 million due to timing of invoices and payments to our vendors, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 1.2 million, and a decrease in deferred revenue of 0.2 million due to recognition of the unamortized portion of the upfront payment under our collaboration agreement with SymBio. Investing Activities Net cashed used in investing activities was 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily related to the transaction costs paid in cash of 3.6 million in connection with the acquisition of Trawsfynydd. Investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were immaterial. Financing Activities Net cashed provided by financing activities was 14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and attributable to the net proceeds received from the private placement of our Common Stock. There were no financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Material Cash Requirements We have not achieved profitability since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We expect net cash expended in 2024 to be higher than 2023 due to the advancement of our clinical trials for narazaciclib and our new clinical-stage anti-viral compounds acquired in the Merger, as well as the significant transaction-related costs and acquired liabilities associated with the Merger. We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third-party contract organizations for clinical trials, preclinical studies, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination following a certain period after notice and therefore we believe that, currently, our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our ongoing trials and operations into the first quarter of 2025; therefore, based on current projections, we do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to support our operations for at least the 12 months following the date that these financial statements are issued. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through the one-year period after the date that the financial statements are issued. We are exploring various sources of funding for continued development of our product candidates, as well as our ongoing operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant non-disclosure agreement preparation and commercialization expenses. We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. We may rely on licensing and co-promotion agreements with strategic or collaborative partners for the commercialization of our products in the United States and other territories. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States for any of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval, such commercial infrastructure could be expected to include a targeted oncology sales force supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure internally, we would have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to having any certainty about marketing approval. Furthermore, we have and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company and to satisfy the obligations under the Merger Agreement, Stock Purchase Agreement and related agreements. For additional risks, please see Risk Factors in Part II of this report and previously disclosed in our Annual Report. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, the Company is not required to provide the information otherwise required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Managements Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, evaluated any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely t o materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are not party to any pending material legal proceedings and are not aware of any such proceedings contemplated by governmental authorities. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report and in other reports filed with the SEC, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The following risk factors and the risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital We have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern As described in our liquidity footnote to our interim unaudited financial statements and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, we have incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and have an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2024 of 619.2 million and 5.4 million of cash that will last into the first quarter of fiscal 2025. We do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents as of the date of this Form 10-Q to support our operations past the first quarter of fiscal 2025. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The future success of the Company is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional funding. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in obtaining such funding in sufficient amounts, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The failure to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in us.

 Risk Related to Our Business and Industry The oncology and virology product candidates under development by Traws Pharma will be subject to the same risks with respect to the Company s business and industry, dependence on third parties, product development, regulatory compliance, and, if approved, product commercialization as those described in the Annual Report. As a result of the combination of Onconova Therapeutics and Trawsfynydd Therapeutics, the newly formed Traws Pharma has a diversified product pipeline consisting of both virology and oncology development programs. Specifically, we are developing TRX01 (ratutrelvir) for COVID19, TRX100 (tivoxavir marboxil) for seasonal or pandemic influence, Narazaciclib for solid tumors, Narazaciclib combined with Letrozole for second/third line low grade endometrioid endometrial cancer, and Rigosertib for epidermolysis bullosa-associated squamous cell carcinoma. These product candidates and our activities associated with them will be subject to the same risks as those that were previously described in the Onconova Therapeutics 10-K. It is also possible that some of these risks may be greater with respect to the virology products based on FDA s prior experience with products intended for influenza and COVID19. Notably, in recent years FDA has published guidance on the development of products for both influenza and COVID19 treatment. Clinical and non-clinical development is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain as to the outcome. A failure of one or more preclinical tests or clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing, and encouraging results in preclinical testing and earlier clinical studies do not ensure that later clinical trials will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug. There is also no guaranty that we will be able to commence or successfully and timely complete clinical studies. Even if our clinical development programs are successful, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product and if we or our third-party contractors, including clinical sites, preclinical laboratories, contract research organizations, manufacturers and suppliers, and other vendors are not able to follow the applicable regulatory requirements, meet the applicable contractual requirements, and comply with the applicable study plans and product requirements, we may face enforcement actions, may not be able to commence studies or may be delayed in commencing studies, may not receive marketing approval, or may need to repeat studies, any of which would materially harm our business. Risk Factors Relating to the Merger There is no guarantee that the Merger will increase stockholder value. In April 2024, we merged with Trawsfynydd. We cannot guarantee that implementing the Merger and related transactions will not impair stockholder value or otherwise adversely affect our business. The Merger poses significant integration challenges between our businesses and management teams which could result in management and business disruptions, any of which could harm our results of operation, business prospects, and impair the value of the Merger to our stockholders. Stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Merger, including the issuance of our Common Stock upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Series C to be issued in the Merger and Financing. If we are unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger, stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent we are able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.

 The failure to successfully integrate the businesses of Onconova and Trawsfynydd in the expected timeframe would adversely affect Traws Pharma s future results. Our ability to successfully integrate the operations of Onconova and Trawsfynydd will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the Merger. If we are not able to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of our common shares may be adversely affected. In addition, the integration of the Company s and Trawsfynydd s respective businesses will be a time-consuming and expensive process. Proper planning and effective and timely implementation will be critical to avoid any significant disruption to Traws Pharma s operations. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of its ongoing business or the identification of inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect its ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, creditors, lessors, clinical trial investigators or managers or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger. Delays encountered in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on Traws Pharma s revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition, including the value of its common shares. The termination of employees undertaken to extend our cash runway and focus more of our capital resources on our prioritized research and development programs might not achieve our intended outcome. In April 2024, we terminated 11 of our 17 employees in order to conserve cash, after payment of severance benefits, for continued development of our product candidates. The terminations may result in unintended consequences and costs, such as the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, attrition beyond the intended number of employees, decreased morale among our remaining employees and consultants, increased reliance on third parties and the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the terminations. In addition, while positions have been eliminated, certain functions necessary to our operations remain, and we might not successfully distribute the duties and obligations of our terminated employees among our remaining employees and consultants. The reduction in workforce could also make it difficult for us to pursue, or prevent us from pursuing, new opportunities and initiatives due to insufficient personnel, or require us to incur additional and unanticipated costs to hire new personnel to pursue such opportunities or initiatives. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from the terminations, or if we experience significant adverse consequences therefrom, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage its expanded operations. As a result of the Merger, we will become a more diversified company and our business will become more complex. There can be no assurance that we will effectively manage the increased complexity without experiencing operating inefficiencies or control deficiencies. Significant management time and effort is required to effectively manage our increased complexity and our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, as a result of the Merger, our financial statements and results of operations for periods prior to April 1, 2024 may not provide meaningful guidance to form an assessment of the prospects or potential success of our future business operations. We expect to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Trawsfynydd. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial expenses in connection with the Merger and the integration of Trawsfynydd. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, billing, payroll, research and development, marketing and benefits. Both the Company and Trawsfynydd have incurred significant transaction expenses in connection with the drafting and negotiation of the Merger Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement and the related ancillary agreements and significant severance expenses in connection with the reduction of employees in April. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These integration expenses likely will result in our taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the Merger, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.

 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock We are not in compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements. If we are unable to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common Stock could be delisted, which could affect our Common Stock's market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital. We are required to meet certain qualitative and financial tests to maintain the listing of our securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq). On September 25, 2023, we received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that we failed to comply with the minimum bid price requirement of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires that companies listed on Nasdaq maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least 1.00 per share. As of October 29, 2024, we regained compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements related to minimum bid price. On August 23, 2024, the Company was notified by the Staff that the Company is no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq The Company attended a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Nasdaq Panel on November 14, 2024 to present its plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing criteria. If we are unable to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, our Common Stock could be delisted, making it more difficult to buy or sell our securities and to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of our securities could suffer a material decline. Delisting could also impair our ability to raise capital. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Not applicable. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities Not applicable. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers , , or any contract, instruction, or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) (a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement") or any "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K).
