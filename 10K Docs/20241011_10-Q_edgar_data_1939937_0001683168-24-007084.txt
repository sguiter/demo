. These factors among others raise substantial
doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

In order to continue as a going concern, the Company
will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining
capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity
and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its
plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Revenue is recognized when the following criteria
are met: 

Identification of the contract, or contracts, with customer; 

Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; 

Determination of the transaction price; 

Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 

Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligation. 

The Company has evaluated all the recent accounting
pronouncements and determined that there are no other accounting pronouncements that will have a material effect on the Company s
financial statements.

 Valuation allowance 

Deferred tax assets 

The Company
has approximately of net operating losses NOL carried forward to
offset taxable income, if any, in future years which expire in fiscal 2041. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences
become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the
deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be
realized.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not
historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified
by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate,"
"approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to
the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what occur in the future. However,
forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results
and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim
any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement
or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 

EMPLOYEES
AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS 

At present we have to employees. Beside our officer
and director Mr. Witmer, we also have an executive employee Mr. Stephen Townsend. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance,
stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we intend to adopt such plans in the near future. On top of the employment
agreements compensations of these two employees, there are presently no additional personal bonuses available to any officers, directors
or employees. 

Results of Operation 

Our financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of
assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

We expect we will require additional capital to
meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt
securities. 

Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 2023: 

During the three months ended August 31, 2024
we have generated 3,750 in revenue as compared to 0 revenue during the three months ended August 31, 2024. 

Our net loss for the three months ended August
31, 2024 was 3,910. Operating expenses consist of mainly depreciation and amortization expenses other administrative expenses. 

Our net loss for the three months ended August
31, 2023 was 12,161. Operating expenses consist of mainly legal and professional fees, depreciation and amortization expenses other
administrative expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of August 31, 2024, our total assets were 27,958
consisting of intangibles 7,120, equipment 3,693 and cash and cash equivalents of 1,028, account receivables of 15,250 and interest
receivables of 867. As of August 31, 2024, our total liabilities were 86,764 comprised of accrued expenses 1,211, advance from our
director of 15,958, note payable of 29,000 and note and loan payable in total to related party of 28,100, accrued interest of 12,495. 

Total current liabilities were 14,169 consisting
of advances from related party and accrued expenses. While total non-current liabilities of 69,595 comprises of loan payable to related
party 18,100, notes payable to related party 10,000, notes payable to others 29,000 and accrued interest of 12,495. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

We have generated negative cash flows from operating
activities. For three months ended August 31, 2024, net cash flow used in operating activities was (1,416) and for three months ended
August 31, 2023 net cash flow was (7,951). 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

As of August 31, 2024 2023, net cash flows
used in investing activities were 0. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

As of August 31, 2024 2023, net cash flows
from financing activities were 1,416 and 1414, as a result of increase in accrued interest. 

Plan of Operation and Funding 

We expect that working capital requirements will
continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements
are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

Existing working capital, further advances and
debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no
lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private
placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating
expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of assets; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business;
and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter,
we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances
of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate
funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors
or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in
the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such
funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We
have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although no future arrangement for additional loans has
been made. We do not have any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future
equity financing. 

15 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do
not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to investors. 

Going Concern 

The financial statements have been prepared "assuming
that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments
in the ordinary course of business. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Due to the limited level of operations, the Company
has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that the Company is a going concern. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

As a smaller reporting company as
defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e)) within the end of
the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective
to ensure that material information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported in a timely manner. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in the Company's internal
control over financial reporting during the nine months period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

16
