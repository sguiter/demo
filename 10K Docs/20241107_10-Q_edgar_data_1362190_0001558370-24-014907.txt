In addition, the Company entered into membership agreements to occupy shared office space in Lehi, Utah, Tucson, Arizona, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington. Because these agreements do not qualify as a lease under ASC 842, we expense the related rent and membership fees as they are incurred. In the first quarter of 2023, we closed our Marietta, Georgia office. As a result of abandoning the office space prior to its lease expiration in August 2024, we wrote off the associated right-of-use asset in full and recognized a loss on impairment, which is included in General and administrative in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to focus on product innovation, expanding revenue and managing expenses. We have two sales channels to deliver our product, the Partner and Marketplace channel and the Enterprise channel. AudioEye continues to focus on recurring revenue growth in both channels, while still offering our website and mobile application reporting services and PDF remediation services that provide non-recurring revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue increased by 9 over the prior year comparable period. As of September 30, 2024, Annual Recurring Revenue ARR was approximately 36.2 million, which represented an increase of 19 year-over-year. Refer to Other Key Operating Metrics below for details on how we calculate ARR. As of September 30, 2024, AudioEye had approximately 126,000 customers, an 18 increase from 107,000 customers at September 30, 2023. The increase in customer count is attributed to both our Partner and Marketplace and Enterprise channels. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from our Partner and Marketplace channel grew 12 over the prior year comparable period. This channel represented about 58 of ARR at the end of September 2024. In nine months ended September 30, 2024, total Enterprise channel revenue grew 5 over the prior year comparable period. The Enterprise channel represented about 42 of ARR at the end of September 2024. We had one customer (including the customer s affiliates reflecting multiple contracts and a partnership with the Company) which accounted for approximately 16 of our total revenue in each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Total research and development cost, as defined under Research and Development Expenses section in the Results of Operations below, was 20 of total revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Total research and development cost decreased from the prior year comparable period primarily due to the completion of significant initiatives in research and development.

Other Key Operating Metrics We consider annual recurring revenue ARR as a key operating metric and a key indicator of our overall business. We also use ARR as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating, on at least a quarterly and annual basis, actual results against such expectations. We define ARR as the sum of (i) for our Enterprise channel, the total of the annualized recurring fee at the date of determination under each active contract, plus (ii) for our Partner and Marketplace channel, the annual or monthly recurring fee for all active customers at the date of determination, in each case, assuming no changes to the subscription, multiplied by 12 if applicable. Recurring fees are defined as revenues expected to be generated from services typically offered as a subscription service or annual service offering such as our automation and platform, periodic auditing, human-assisted technological fixes, legal support and professional service offerings and other services that reoccur on a multi-year contract. This determination includes both annual and monthly contracts for recurring products. Some of our contracts are terminable prior to the expected term, which may impact future ARR. ARR excludes non-recurring fees, which are defined as revenue expected to be generated from services typically not offered as a subscription service or annual service offering such as our PDF remediation services business, one-time mobile application reports, and other miscellaneous services that are offered as non-subscription services or are expected to be one-time in nature. As of September 30, 2024, ARR was 36.2 million, which represents an increase of 19 year-over-year, driven by growth in both our Partner and Marketplace channel and Enterprise channel.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Working Capital 

(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Current assets 11,396 14,776 Current liabilities (13,610) (11,529) Working capital (2,214) 3,247 As of September 30, 2024, we had 5,478,000 in cash and working capital of 2,214,000). The 5.5 million decrease in working capital in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the acquisition of ADA Site Compliance , for which we made an initial payment of 3.1 million, net of cash received, and recognized 2.3 million in noncurrent note payable. In November 2023, the Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 5 million of our common stock through December 31, 2025. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not commit the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or particular number of shares of stock. Shares repurchased under the program are subsequently retired and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. I n the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 2.02 million in cash to repurchase 299,371 shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.86 million remaining for the repurchase of shares. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company initiated an At The Market offering ATM offering ), under which the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 7.0 million from time to time. As of September 30, 2024, we had issued 162,524 shares of our common stock and raised 3,473,000, net of transaction expenses, under the ATM offering. In the second quarter of 2024, we made a 2.4 million cash payment to settle the contingent consideration associated with the BOIA acquisition in full. As of September 30, 2024, we had 7.0 million in noncurrent term loan which matures on November 30, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, we had Note Payable in the aggregate principal amount of 2.4 million , which matures on November 26, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements, and we believe that the Company has sufficient liquidity to continue as a going concern through the next twelve months. While the Company has been successful in raising capital, there is no assurance that it will be successful at raising additional capital in the future. Additionally, if the Company s plans are not achieved and/or if significant unanticipated events occur, the Company may have to further modify its business plan, which may require us to raise additional capital or reduce expenses. Cash Flows

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in relation to the prior year comparable period, cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to capital raised under the ATM Offering initiated in the second quarter of 2024, under which we issued 162,524 shares of our common stock and raised 3,473,000, net of transaction expenses. The decrease was partially offset by common stock repurchases totaling 2.02 million, as well as higher payouts towards the contingent consideration in connection with the acquisition of BOIA. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, payments towards this contingent consideration totaled 2,387,000, of which 1,677,000 and 710,000 were classified as cash used in financing and operating activities, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, payments towards this contingent consideration totaled 974,000, of which 908,000 and 66,000 were classified as cash used in financing and operating activities, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting estimates, as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, relate to stock-based compensation and goodwill, intangible assets and contingent consideration recognized in connection with a business combination. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not applicable. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that there is reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of disclosure controls and procedures in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures to future periods are subject to the risk that controls or procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the controls or procedures may deteriorate. As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
