 The Company s unrealized losses from debt securities as of September 30, 2024 were generated from approximately positions out of a total of positions. The Company believes that it will timely collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was not material.

 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. The assets and liabilities within our South American operations held for sale as of September 30, 2024 were measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Fair value is measured based upon unobservable amounts, such as estimated selling price derived from Company-specific information and market conditions.

 Legal Matters 
 The Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. 
 The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be incurred. 
 Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews 
 The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office for Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and other governmental authorities. Similarly, the Company s international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial condition or results of operations will be materially adversely affected. Certain of the Company s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the

 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 General 
 UnitedHealth Group is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary businesses Optum and UnitedHealthcare are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. 
 We have four reportable segments: 
 Optum Health; 
 Optum Insight; 
 Optum Rx; and 
 UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community State. 
 Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, Business and Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 10 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
 
 Change Healthcare Cyberattack 
 As previously announced, on February 21, 2024, we identified that cybercrime threat actors had gained access to certain Change Healthcare information technology systems. Upon detection of this outside threat, we isolated the impacted systems to protect our partners and customers. 
 We have made substantial progress in mitigating the impact to consumers and care providers of the unprecedented cyberattack on the U.S. health system and have restored the majority of the affected Change Healthcare services. To support care providers we provided interest-free loans of nearly 9 billion through September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 341 million and 1.7 billion of direct response costs, respectively; including increased medical care expenditures, as we suspended some care management activities to help care providers with their workflow processes; costs associated with providing interest-free loans; notifications of impacted persons; and network restoration. Optum Insight also experienced estimated business disruption impacts of 134 million and 747 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, reflecting lost revenue while maintaining full readiness of the affected Change Healthcare services. We expect to continue to incur direct response costs and experience business disruption impacts over the remainder of the year, which will continue at a lesser extent in 2025 as we work to bring transaction volumes back to pre-event levels and win new business. 
 Based upon our ongoing review of the impacted data, we have found files containing protected health information (PHI) or personally identifiable information (PII), which cover a substantial proportion of people in America. In June 2024, Change Healthcare gave public notice of the breach under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and began notifying affected customer entities in June and individuals in late July. The investigation of impacted data is ongoing. It is

 possible that future risks and uncertainties resulting from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, including risks related to impacted data, litigation, reputational harm, and regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Business Trends 
 Our businesses participate in the United States and certain other international health markets. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. 
 Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of expected future costs, including medical cost trends, inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. 
 The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. 
 Government programs in the community and senior sector tend to receive lower rates of increase than the commercial market due to governmental budget pressures and lower cost trends. 
 Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, care activity and prescription drug costs. As expected and contemplated in our benefits design, we have continued to observe increased care patterns, primarily related to outpatient procedures for seniors, which may continue in future periods. In the third quarter, we also experienced higher medical costs due to a pronounced upshift in coding intensity by hospitals and an acceleration of the prescribing of certain high-cost specialty medications, primarily those used to treat cardiovascular disease, auto-immune disorders and cancer. We endeavor to mitigate these increases by engaging hospitals, physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve quality, affordable care. 
 As a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack, we incurred medical costs related to the impact of the temporary suspension of some care management activities, impacting our UnitedHealthcare and Optum Health businesses, to help care providers with their workflow processes. Early in the second quarter we resumed these activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, medical costs related to the temporary suspension of some care management activities were 630 million. 
 Medicaid Redeterminations. Medicaid redeterminations have impacted the number of people served through our Medicaid offerings, partially offset by an increase in consumers served through our commercial offerings as we endeavor to ensure that people and families have continued access to care. The Medicaid redetermination process has also caused a timing mismatch between the current health status of people served through Medicaid and state rate updates, which remain well short of current care activity. 
 Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties 
 Medicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices over the years have at times resulted in industry base rates well below the industry forward medical cost trend. For example, the Final Notices for 2024 and 2025 rates resulted in an industry base rate decrease, both well short of an increasing industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Further, substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient s health status and care resource needs, will result in reduced funding and potentially benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges. 
 As a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.

 2024 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2023 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Consolidated Financial Results 
 Revenues 
 The increases in revenues were primarily driven by growth in Optum Rx and Optum Health, growth across our UnitedHealthcare domestic offerings and pricing trends, partially offset by decreased UnitedHealthcare international revenue due to the sale of our Brazil operations. 
 Medical Costs and MCR 
 Medical costs increased primarily due to growth in people served through Medicare Advantage, those with higher acuity needs and domestic commercial offerings. The MCR increased as a result of the revenue effects of the Medicare funding reductions, decreased favorable reserve development and member mix. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the MCR also increased due to incremental medical costs for accommodations made to care providers as a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack. 
 Operating Cost Ratio 
 The operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to operating cost management and business portfolio and asset dispositions, partially offset by the impact of our direct response efforts to the Change Healthcare cyberattack and investments to support future growth. 
 Loss on Sale of Subsidiary and Subsidiaries Held for Sale 
 On February 6, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Brazil operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a loss of 7.1 billion, of which 4.1 billion related to the impact of cumulative foreign currency translation losses previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, the Company initiated a plan to sell its remaining South American operations, which were classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. As a result, the Company recorded a loss of 1.2 billion, of which 876 million related to the impact of cumulative foreign currency translation losses. 
 Reportable Segments 
 See Note 10 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including people served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the level and scope of services provided to people, and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment.

 UnitedHealthcare s revenues increased due to growth in the number of people served through Medicare Advantage, domestic commercial offerings and those with higher acuity needs, partially offset by decreased people served globally due to the sale of our Brazil operations and Medicaid offerings due to continued redeterminations. Earnings from operations decreased due to Medicare Advantage funding reductions, the impacts of Medicaid redeterminations and decreased favorable reserve development, partially offset by the factors impacting revenue above. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, earnings from operations also decreased due to incremental medical costs for accommodations to support care providers as a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack. 
 Optum 
 Total revenues increased due to growth at Optum Rx and Optum Health. Earnings from operations increased at Optum Health and Optum Rx, partially offset by the impacts of the Change Healthcare cyberattack. The results by segment were as follows: 
 Optum Health 
 Revenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in patients served under value-based care arrangements. Earnings from operations increased due to cost management initiatives, business portfolio and asset dispositions and increased investment income, partially offset by Medicare Advantage funding reductions and costs associated with serving newly added patients under value-based care arrangements. Optum Health served approximately 104 million people and 103 million people as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Optum Insight 
 Revenues at Optum Insight decreased due the business disruption impacts from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, partially offset by growth in technology services. Earnings from operations decreased primarily due to the business disruption impacts and direct response costs related to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, partially offset by growth in business services. 
 Optum Rx 
 Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from both new clients and growth in existing clients and growth in pharmacy services. Earnings from operations also increased due to operating cost efficiencies and supply chain initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 407 million and 383 million adjusted scripts in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity 
 Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities 21,835 34,261 (12,426) Issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net of repayments 15,120 5,848 9,272 Proceeds from common stock issuances 1,611 1,039 572 Customer funds administered 2,037 (2,037) Sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases 1,852 1,852 Repayments of care provider loans - cyberattack 3,189 3,189 Total sources of cash 43,607 43,185 422 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (4,028) (6,500) 2,472 Cash paid for acquisitions and other transactions, net of cash assumed (11,674) (8,389) (3,285) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (2,850) 2,850 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (2,587) (2,427) (160) Cash dividends paid (5,601) (5,023) (578) Loans to care providers - cyberattack (8,904) (8,904) Customer funds administered (1,059) (1,059) Other (2,497) (2,495) (2) Total uses of cash (36,350) (27,684) (8,666) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (30) 49 (79) Increase in cash and cash equivalents, including cash classified within assets held for sale 7,227 15,550 (8,323) Less: net increase in cash classified within assets held for sale (254) (254) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 6,973 15,550 (8,577) 
 2024 Cash Flows Compared to 2023 Cash Flows 
 Decreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by the receipt of the October CMS premium payment of 11.9 billion in September 2023 and Change Healthcare cyberattack response actions. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, net sales and maturities of investments and decreased share repurchases, offset by loans to care providers in response to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, increased cash paid for acquisitions and other transactions and decreased customer funds administered. 
 Financial Condition 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of 83.5 billion included approximately 32.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which 5.2 billion was available for general corporate use), 46.3 billion of debt securities and 4.9 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.0 years and a weighted-average credit rating of Double A as of September 30, 2024. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.

 Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity 
 In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: 
 Cash Requirements. A summary of our cash requirements as of December 31, 2023 was disclosed in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 10-K. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. We continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and business combinations. 
 Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in our 2023 10-K. 
 Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders equity ratio of not more than 60 . As of September 30, 2024, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 43 . 
 Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in our 2023 10-K. 
 Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 
 Moody s S P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A2 Stable A+ Stable A Stable A Stable Commercial paper P-1 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1+ n/a 
 The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. 
 Share Repurchase Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 7.7 million shares at an average price of 521.21 per share. In June 2024, our Board of Directors amended our share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to 35 million shares of Common Stock, in addition to all remaining shares authorized to be repurchased under the Board s 2018 renewal of the program. As of September 30, 2024, we had Board of Directors authorization to purchase up to 42 million shares of our common stock. The Board of Directors from time to time may further amend the share repurchase program in order to increase the authorized number of shares which may be repurchased under the program. 
 Dividends. In June 2024, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to an annual rate of 8.40 compared to 7.52 per share, which we had paid since June 2023. For more information on our dividend, see Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
 Pending Transactions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had entered into transaction agreements in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and/or other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated consideration required for these transactions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, was approximately 5 billion. 
 For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 in our 2023 10-K.

 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 There are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations. 
 Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 in our 2023 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in our 2023 10-K. 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include forward-looking statements which are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. The words believe, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, forecast, outlook, plan, project, should and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; cyberattacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; the DOJ s legal action relating to the risk adjustment submission matter; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; risks and uncertainties associated with our businesses providing pharmacy care services; competitive pressures, including our ability to maintain or increase our market share; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers; the impact of potential changes in tax laws and regulations; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to complete, manage or integrate strategic transactions; risk and uncertainties associated with the continuing sale of operations in South America; risks associated with public health crises arising from large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, natural disasters and other extreme events; failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; failure to protect proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products; downgrades in our credit ratings; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, reinvest in our business, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock. 
 This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.

 We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. 
 The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1 point or 2 points as of September 30, 2024 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): 
 September 30, 2024 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 824 457 (3,773) (10,539) 1 412 229 (1,936) (5,745) (1) (412) (212) 2,015 7,016 (2) (824) (423) 4,083 15,514 
 Note: The impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates may not reflect the full 100 or 200 basis point change on interest income and interest expense or on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities as the rates are assumed to not fall below zero. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024.
