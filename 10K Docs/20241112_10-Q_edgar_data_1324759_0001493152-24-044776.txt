of revival with the state of Nevada, appointing David Lazar as, President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director. 

On October 4, 2019, the Company issued

party loan for amounts advanced to the Company in the amount of , and a note receivable due to the Company in the amount of .
The note bears an interest of and matures in days following written demand by the holder. 

On April 14, 2020, Custodian Ventures elected to convert
the total amount of the shares of Series A preferred stock into shares of common stock. 

On April 15, 2020, the Board of directors of the Company
approved the withdrawal of the certificate of designation of shares of Series A Preferred stock filed with the Nevada Secretary
of State on August 24, 2012, as amended by the Amendment to Certificate of Designation after issuance of Class or Series filed with the

The accompanying financial statements are prepared
on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The Company is a development
stage enterprise devoting substantial efforts to establishing a new business, financial planning, raising capital, and research into products
which may become part of the Company s product portfolio. The Company has not realized significant sales since inception. A development
stage company is defined as one in which all efforts are devoted substantially to establishing a new business and, even if planned principal
operations have commenced, revenues are insignificant. 

The Company is planning potential acquisitions. The
management has approached several companies in China and met the management of potential acquisition targets. The Company feels strongly
that despite the challenges of cross border business, it might be able to acquire some good growth companies and bring good values to
our stockholders. Although the Company is making some progress in the Merger and Acquisition efforts, any potential results, if any, are
still not certain. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient
to cover its operating costs and is dependent on debt and equity financing to fund its operations. Management of the Company is making
efforts to raise additional funding until a registration statement relating to an equity funding facility is in effect. While management
of the Company believes that it will be successful in its capital formation and planned operating activities, there can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to raise additional equity capital, or be successful in the development and commercialization of the products
it develops or initiates collaboration agreements thereon. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may
result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

The Company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits
as current to the extent that the Company anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to
uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Forward Looking Statement Notice 

Certain statements made in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995)
regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of Crown Marketing, we , us ,
 our or the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations
that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company s plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the
continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic,
competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many
of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements
are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking statements
included in this Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking
statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person
that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved. 

Overview 

The Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada
on September 14, 2001 under the name Biocorp North America, Inc. On July 19, 2004 the Company changed its name to Nat-UR, Inc. and on
March 18, 2005 it changed its name again to Cereplast, Inc. In the summer of 2014, the Company ceased all operations. 

On March 22, 2019, the eight judicial District Court
of Nevada appointed Custodian Ventures, LLC as custodian for Cereplast, Inc., proper notice having been given to the officers and directors
of Cereplast, Inc. There was no opposition. 

On June 04, 2019, the Company filed a certificate
of revival with the state of Nevada, appointing David Lazar as, President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director. 

A change of control of the Company was completed on
November 3, 2020, control was obtained by the sale of 50,000,000 common shares and 5,000,000 Series A-1 Preferred Shares from Custodian
Ventures, LLC to Xudong Li. After November 3, 2020, the Company s operations are determined and structured by the new major shareholder. 

On November 18, 2020, the Company filed an amendment
to its certificate of incorporation to change its name to Hong Yuan Holding Group. 

We have not yet generated sustained profits from our
prior operations. Our independent accountants have expressed a going concern opinion. As of September 30, 2024, we had an
accumulated deficit of 97,448,110 and a net working capital deficit of 182,433. 

While our current burn rate is nominal, it is expected
that our costs of operations will continue to exceed revenues, primarily due to the costs associated with being a public reporting company.
Based upon our current business plan, we may continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future and there can be no assurances that we
will ever establish profitable operations. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company is planning potential acquisitions. The
management has approached several companies in China and met the management of potential acquisition targets. The Company feels strongly
that despite the challenges of cross border business, it might be able to acquire some good growth companies and bring good values to
our stockholders. Although the Company is making some progress in the Merger and Acquisition efforts, any potential results, if any, are
still not certain.

Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates,
judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

An accounting policy is considered to be critical
if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate
is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely
to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect
the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition 

ASU No. 2014-09 , Revenue from Contracts
with Customers Topic 606 ), became effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and were adopted using the modified
retrospective method. The adoption of the new revenue standards as of January 1, 2018 did not change the Company s revenue recognition
as there were no revenues during the period. 

Under the new revenue standards, the Company recognizes
revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects
to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09:
(i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price;
(iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy
the performance obligation. 

Accounts receivable 

The Company reviews accounts receivable periodically
for collectability and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts and records bad debt expense when deemed necessary. Our allowance
for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers inability to make required payments. If there
is deterioration of our customers credit worthiness and/or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are
past due greater than the historical assumptions used, additional allowances may be required. The Company has no accounts receivables
and therefore as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. 

Income Taxes 

The Company follows the asset and liability method
of accounting for future income taxes. Under this method, future income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on temporary differences
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their corresponding tax basis. In addition, the future benefits of income tax
assets including unused tax losses, are recognized, subject to a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that
such future benefits will ultimately be realized. Future income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws
expected to apply when the tax liabilities or assets are to be either settled or realized. The Company s effective tax rate approximates
the Federal statutory rates. 

Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

During the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, we generated no revenues. 

12 

Operating expenses, during the quarter ended September
30, 2024, was 5,495 compared to 10,166 during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 4,671 or 45.9 . The decrease was
mainly due to the lower professional fees. Operating expenses, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 31,189 compared to
 31,419 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 230 or 0.7 , relatively flat 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company
incurred a net loss of 5,495, compared to a net loss of 10,166 during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 4,671. The
decrease in net loss in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the decrease in operating expenses. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 31,189, compared to a net loss of 31,419 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 230, relatively flat. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we
had a cash balance of 0. Due to the lack of revenue, the company s operations are primarily funded by the Company s CEO and
major shareholder. 

To the extent that the Company s capital resources
are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements, the Company will seek additional funds through equity or debt financing,
collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners, licensees or others, and from other sources, which may have the effect of
diluting the holdings of existing shareholders. The Company has no current arrangements with respect to, or sources of, such additional
financing and the Company does not anticipate that existing shareholders will provide any portion of the Company s future financing
requirements. Mr. Xudong, the CEO and principal shareholder of the Company, would favorably entertain funding, through loans, corporate
expenses for approximately 24 months. Any loans by Mr. Xudong would be on an interest-free basis, documented by a promissory note and
payable only upon consummation of a business combination transaction. Upon consummation of a business combination, we or the target may
reimburse Mr. Xudong for any such loans from funds furnished by the target. We have no written agreement with Mr. Xudong to advance any
further funds for future operating expense, therefore there is no assurance that such funds from Mr. Xudong will be forth coming, if required. 

No assurance can be given that additional financing
will be available when needed or that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate funds are not available,
the Company may be required to delay or terminate expenditures for certain of its programs that it would otherwise seek to develop and
commercialize. This would have a material adverse effect on the Company. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern. 

Operating Activities 

We neither generated nor used cash in operating activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Investing Activities 

We neither generated nor used cash in investing activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Financing Activities 

We neither generated nor used cash in financing activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, we have incurred net losses
of 31,189 and 31,419 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and have a working capital deficit of 182,433
as of September 30, 2024, in addition to a stockholders deficit of 182,433 which raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

13 

Management believes the Company will continue to incur
losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future and will need additional equity or debt financing
to sustain its operations until it can achieve profitability and positive cash flows, if ever. Management plans to seek additional debt
and/or equity financing for the Company but cannot assure that such financing will be available on acceptable terms. 

The Company s continuation as a going concern
is dependent upon its ability to ultimately attain profitable operations, generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations, and obtain
additional financing as may be required. Our auditors have included a going concern qualification in their Report of Independent
Certified Public Accountants accompanying our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere herein which cites substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. Such a going concern qualification may make it more difficult for us to raise
funds when needed. The outcome of this uncertainty cannot be assured. 

The accompanying financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that management will be successful in
implementing its business plan or that the successful implementation of such business plan will actually improve our operating results. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

Inflation 

We do not believe that inflation has had in the past
or will have in the future any significant negative impact on our operations. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

As a smaller reporting company as defined
by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures performed by our Chief Executive Officer as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief
Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of a weakness in the design of
internal control over financial reporting identified below. 

As used herein, disclosure controls and procedures 
mean controls and other procedures of our company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Controls 

There have been no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting during the period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
