Background of the Company 

Vado, through Socialcom, operates as a digital marketing and services company focused on delivering integrated advertising and technology performance solutions to independent agencies and brands through its omnichannel trading desk platform. 

In response to a decline in customer ad purchasing which began in 2022, management has taken steps to (i) improve the employee experience and in turn improve employee retention; and (ii) enhance our product offerings and strengthen our core solutions to the middle market. More specifically, in order to drive increased customer acquisition, the Company is focused on improved market differentiation related to product development and innovation in the key three areas of: (i) predictive analytics, (ii) supply optimization, and (iii) creative automation. In 2023 we developed an industry leading, data-driven addition to our tech stack, successfully incorporating several layers of artificial intelligence (AI), predictive analytics, and automation in the application of data science, audience insights and tech-powered creative, an integrated and holistic system designed to optimize performance in real time for our brand and agency customers. We have successfully taken our new AI-powered data science solutions to market through various ongoing sales and marketing activities and are currently activating campaigns and delivering impact for both existing and new customers 

In addition, in March 2024 we obtained 11 customer accounts and 14 employees from a very large company, which includes over 4 million in prepaid amounts (and thereby potential additional revenue), in addition to the continued good will, subject to our provision of services to the new customers and to that party s right to offset for personnel expenses. See Note 3. Transfer of Customers and Employees. 

Moving forward, we are actively assessing the mergers and acquisitions (M A) landscape to identify potential acquisition targets, whether creative, media or technology companies, with stable customers and revenues, that can drive improved business outcomes through integrated access to the Socialcom media services solution.

Trends and Uncertainties 

Our operations and industry are subject to the following trends and uncertainties: 

Seasonality 

In the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. For example, some advertisers may allocate the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. Historically, the fourth quarter of the year reflects our highest level of advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity. We expect our revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as a whole. 

Developments in the Programmatic Advertising Market 

Our operating results and prospects will be impacted by the overall adoption of programmatic advertising by inventory owners and content providers, as well as advertisers and the agencies and service providers that represent them. Programmatic advertising has grown rapidly in recent years, and any acceleration or slowing of this growth may affect our operating and financial performance. In addition, even if the programmatic advertising market continues to grow at its current rate, our ability to position ourselves within the market will impact the future growth of our business. 

In addition, technological and other changes and developments in the digital ad space will also affect our operations and operating results. For example, many websites including Google are expected to update or alter their privacy settings and practices in the coming years, including by eliminating cookies and the collection of personal identifiable information about users, for which we and our industry will need to adjust in order to maintain and grow our operations. 

Growth in and Retention of Customers 

Our ability to generate and maintain revenue depends on retaining our existing customers and adding new customers. Our customers consist of small-to-medium sized businesses, with spending patterns that can be inconsistent or unpredictable. We also depend on a relatively small number of customers for a large proportion of our revenue streams. As a result, future revenue and growth depends upon our ability to retain our existing customers and to gain a larger amount of their advertising spend through our platform and related services. 

Labor Shortages 

Because of our focus on digital advertisements and the underlying technology and infrastructure involved in those processes, as well as providing a wide variety of businesses with their digital marketing needs, our operations depend on procuring, training and maintaining skilled personnel to assist us and our customers in fulfilling these demands. In recent periods, macroeconomic factors have contributed to labor shortages in the U.S. across industries. As a result of this and other factors, in fiscal year 2022 the loss of certain personnel, including members of our sales and customer support team, adversely impacted our operating results in that period. If the tightened labor market trend continues in general or for our business in particular, this trend could persist. In fiscal year 2023, we made significant strides in optimizing our operations, which not only reduced our operating expenses but also strategically positioned us for sustained incremental growth in the upcoming year. Through a combination of streamlining initiatives and technological advancements, we have enhanced our efficiency and productivity across all departments. Our team is now more agile, our cost structure more efficient, and our business model has been refined to capitalize on emerging opportunities in digital advertising and marketing services. We are confident that the measures taken to strengthen our workforce and operational practices will continue to yield beneficial results and drive growth in the remainder of fiscal year 2024. 

Omnichannel Access 

Because we assist in the selection and purchase of advertising inventory across a wide variety of formats for our customers, such as display, mobile, video, audio, social and native, our future growth will depend on our ability to maintain and grow the inventory of, and customer spend on, advertising channels. For instance, as we proceed further into the digital age, new channels can arise rapidly and gain popularity within relatively short periods, diverting attention from existing channels and forcing stakeholders in the industry, including us, to adapt quickly. Further, each channel we now or may in the future access to service our customers has its own policies in terms of content and use, and we must continually monitor and adhere to these requirements to continue to access those channels for our customers. We believe that our ability to integrate and offer access to new means of digital communication, such as Connected Television (CTV), digital out-of-home (DOOH), and digital radio advertising inventory and to manage the increased costs that will accompany these developments, will impact the operating results and future growth of our business.

Interest income, restricted investment was 29,261 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no comparable transactions in the prior period. The increase is due to the cash held in connection with a vendor dispute. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily influenced by growth or decline in operations, increases or decreases in collections from our customers and related payments to suppliers for advertising media and data. Cash flows from operating activities are typically affected by changes in the components of working capital, particularly changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. Timing differences from cash receipts from customers and payments to suppliers have a significant impact on our cash flows from operating activities. We often pay suppliers in advance of collections from our customers. Our collection and payment cycles can vary from period to period, and we additionally expect seasonality to impact cash flows from operating activities on a quarterly basis during the year. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities of 1,113,091 resulted primarily from a net loss of 5,410,393) adjusted for non-cash items totaling 1,124,114 and a net increase of 5,399,370 resulting from changes in the components of working capital.

The change in the components of working capital of 237,600 was due primarily to a 1,424,950) increase in accounts receivable and a 1,108,089 increase in accounts payable, with the remaining change attributable to normal operational fluctuations in current assets and current liabilities.

Non-GAAP Measures

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income (loss) before (a) certain stock-based compensation expense, (b) costs attributable to non-recurring settlement expense, legal activity, professional fees, and other transaction and offering costs, (c) interest, (d) tax, and (e) depreciation and amortization. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of our core business operations. We believe that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our business separate from non-operational factors that affect net income (loss), thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, this measure may vary among other companies; thus, Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 

The following table sets forth the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP financial measure for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of November 1, 2024, we have a net unrestricted cash of 30,566. Management believes we do not have sufficient working capital to meet our operating needs for the next 12 months. We have a 4 million loan due December 13, 2024 that if not extended may mean we will cease operations. In order to meet our working capital requirements, we will need to either raise sufficient capital or reduce our expenditures. We will rely on our ability to improve operating cash flow or raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities and draw on our existing credit facility, in addition to our existing cash and cash equivalents to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. 

The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to improve cash flow and the ability to obtain additional financing. These and other factors substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern in the following 12-month period. 

We recently determined not to pursue our Regulation A offering which was qualified in November 2023, and will need to locate capital from other sources, which we may not be able to accomplish in a reasonable amount of time or on favorable terms, if at all. 

Our recent and potential future financing transactions, outstanding indebtedness and other developments which will potentially impact our liquidity are summarized below. 

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded an increase in the minimum interest liability due on our Decathlon Loan in the amount of 900,000, and during the three months ended September 30, 2024, this amount was increased by an additional 150,000.

Financing Agreements 

On June 13, 2019, Socialcom entered into an accounts receivable financing and security agreement (the Financing Agreement with SLR Digital Finance, LLC as the secured lender which was amended on September 18, 2023, January 31, 2024 and April 1, 2024. The Financing Agreement as amended has a current maximum amount of 2,000,000 and an interest rate per annum equal to 5 plus the prime rate , which is defined as the higher of the highest rate as reported by the Wall Street Journal or 8.5 . The Financing Agreement provided for an initial financing fee equal to 1/12th of the facility interest rate and additional monthly financing fees of 1/12th of the facility interest rate. The Financing Agreement is subject to an early termination fee equal to 2 of the maximum amount available under the Financing Agreement. Further, the Financing Agreement provides that Socialcom shall at all times use at least 20 of the maximum amount. The revolving credit facility under the Financing Agreement is secured by the trade accounts receivable of Socialcom and guaranteed by its assets and the assets of Vado, including the Socialcom common stock Vado holds representing 100 of the outstanding Socialcom common stock. Upon any event of default, the lender may, among other things, immediately demand repayment of all advanced amounts thereunder. The Financing Agreement provides, among other things, that the lender can immediately terminate the Financing Agreement and demand payment. In addition, Jason Wulfsohn, our Chief Executive Officer and a principal stockholder, guaranteed the loan and pledged his shares of Vado common stock to secure payment. All amounts due under the Financing Agreement have been paid as of September 30, 2024. 

On December 31, 2019, Socialcom borrowed 3,000,000 (the Decathlon Loan ). The Decathlon Loan is due December 13, 2024 and is secured by all the assets of Socialcom. The Decathlon Loan accrues interest at a variable rate based upon internal rate of return targets, which interest multiple is subject to increase by 0.015 upon an event of default. The effective rate of interest for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately 17 . Repayments are required based upon a fixed percentage of our earned revenue. If not repaid prior the final balance is due on December 13, 2024. The Decathlon Loan is subject to minimum interest that escalates over the term of the loan. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the potential liability for unearned minimum interest was 116,837 and 886,733, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made principal payments in the amount 464,476 on the Decathlon loan. 

Related Party Indebtedness

In addition to the risks and uncertainties described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 under the section titled Risk Factors , the Company is subject to the following risks and uncertainties: 

If we are unable to extend a 4 million loan due December 13, 2024, we lack the resources to pay it and as a result may cease operations. 

We owe a third party creditor 4 million under a note which is due December 13, 2024. The Board is actively engaged in discussions to renegotiate the terms of our 4 million note. These efforts are focused on securing an extension or revised payment structure to alleviate immediate financial pressure. If we are unable to extend it or our directors and officers are unable to arrange for any financing to pay it, we likely will cease operations. See Note 11 Loans Payable in this report, and the risk factor titled The terms of Socialcom s loan facility could result in the loss of the Socialcom business or result in a change of control of Vado were a default to occur, or cause other material adverse consequences in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, for more information on this loan and the risks and uncertainties arising therefrom.
