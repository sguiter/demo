thousand, an operating cash outflow of thousand
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 the Company had an accumulated deficit of 
thousand. Absent any other action, the Company will require additional liquidity to continue its operations over the next 12
months. 

The
continuing viability of the Company and its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company being successful in its
continued efforts in growing its revenue and/or accessing additional sources of capital. Management s plan to address this need
includes (a) continued exercise of tight controls to conserve cash, (b) accelerating sales of Casitas to generate revenue, and (c) raising
funds through equity financing. The Company anticipates current capital on hand and expected future funding will be sufficient to fund
the Company s operations in excess of twelve months. The Company is
currently selling shares of its preferred stock through Regulation A and Regulation D offerings in the United States, securities offerings
in Canada, and anticipates raising funds through other offerings of preferred stock. Management believes that the actions presently being taken by the Company will provide sufficient liquidity for the
Company to continue to execute its business plan over the next year. However, there can be no assurances that management s plans
will be achieved.

unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the remaining amount of
purchase commitments was approximately Nil 
and thousand,
respectively. 

A
substantial amount of these deposits as of December 31, 2023 were paid to a vendor who did not fulfill their contractual obligations
to us. As of September 30, 2024, certain deposits, totaling 
thousand were impaired as their recoverability was determined to be uncertain. See Impairment Loss below for more
information. 

Impairment
Loss 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded thousand
and 
 thousand , respectively (September 30, 2023 -
 Nil and
 
 thousand ), respectively, in impairment loss.
The amount recorded as impairment loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are related to assets that were procured to
automate production of a new Casita model. On April 30, 2024, the Company filed a claim against a supplier based on breach of
contract and misrepresentation. This claim was prompted by a key supplier of equipment failing to fulfill their obligation. Despite
anticipating a judgment in its favor, during June 2024, the Company made the determination that (a) it no longer plans to continue
with production of the model and (b) recoverability of these assets and related deposits is uncertain. Considering that this
equipment was customized for the production of this new Casita model and is unable to be used for an alternative purpose, the
Company recognized an impairment loss. For additional information regarding the legal proceedings surrounding this impairment,

Acquisition
of Intangible Assets from Merger Agreement with 500 Group, Inc. 

On
June 15, 2023, the Company engaged in an all-stock statutory merger with 500 Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation 500
Group and its subsidiary Build IP. The Company exchanged 
thousand shares of its Non-Voting Series A-2 Preferred Stock for 500 Group s 100 outstanding shares of 500 Group s
common stock in a transaction valued at 
million, or 
per share. Due to the common control of the Company, 500 Group and Build IP by the Company s Chief Executive Officer, this
transaction was accounted for under the common control accounting standards. In addition, 500 Group and Build IP didn t have
substantial assets, liabilities or operations. Thus, the Company treated the transaction as an asset acquisition, recording 
thousand as intangible assets, which represented the patents at its historical carrying value, and the remaining consideration of
 thousand
as a deemed dividend. The deemed dividend was offset against the Series A-2 Preferred Stock account as the Company currently has an
accumulated deficit. As a result of this merger, 500 Group and Build IP are wholly-owned by BOXABL, and their assets, including the
intellectual property held by Build IP, are now owned and consolidated by BOXABL. Accordingly, the license agreement between BOXABL
and Build IP is now void. This asset acquisition enabled BOXABL to control the intellectual property previously contracted for under
the license agreement that required payment of a 
royalty fee based on gross revenues.

The
Company recognizes lease expense for its operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Most leases include one or more
options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term. The Company has determined that it was reasonably certain that the
renewal options would be exercised based on previous history and knowledge, current understanding of future business needs and the level
of investment in leasehold improvements, among other considerations. The incremental borrowing rate used in the calculation of the lease
liability is based on the rate available to the Company. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the
expected lease term. The Company s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive
covenants. Certain subsidiaries of the Company rent or sublease certain office space to/from other subsidiaries of the Company.

ROU asset is recorded for leases with a lease term, including any reasonably assured renewal terms, of 12 months or less. Upon adoption
of ASC 842, the Company also recorded lease liabilities computed as the present value of future minimum lease payments, including reductions
from any landlord incentives, plus any additional direct costs from executing the leases. Lease liabilities are amortized using the effective
interest method using a discount rate of . Depreciation on the ROU asset is calculated as the difference between the expected straight-line
rent expense over the lease term less the accretion on the lease liability. The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability
for these operating leases in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company s lease agreements also include obligations for the
Company to pay for other services, including operations and maintenance. The Company accounts for these services separately.

of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan to 
million shares (previously 
million shares were reserved for issuance under the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan), as well as certain other amendments, subject to
stockholder approval and notice. The Plan, as amended and restated, became effective on October 18, 2024. 

Administration: 

The
Board of Directors delegated to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors the authority to administer the Plan (the
 Plan Administrator ), which includes the authority to interpret the Plan, to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and
regulations relating to the Plan, to provide for conditions and assurances deemed necessary or advisable to protect the interest of
the Company, and to make all other determinations necessary for the administration of the Plan to the extent not contrary to the
express provisions of the Plan. 

Eligibility: 

Eligible
participants in this Plan include employees of, non-employee directors of, and consultants to the Company. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, awards may also be granted to prospective employees and non-employee members of the Board, but no portion of any
such award shall vest, become exercisable, be issued or become effective prior to the date on which such individual begins providing
services to the Company. 

The
Plan Administrator has the sole discretion to determine which participants will receive an award, including the determination of whether an
award to an eligible participant will further the Plan s purposes of providing incentives to attract, retain and motivate
eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are important to the Company s success by offering them an
opportunity to participate in the Company s future performance through the grant of awards, as well as the type of any award to be granted, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to any award, and
the terms and conditions of any award. 

Awards: 

As
of September 30, 2024, only Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units RSUs were outstanding under the Plan. 

The
Plan permits the following types of awards: 

Stock
Appreciation Rights: 

Stock
Appreciation Rights SARs may be granted to Participants and shall have a per-share base value equal to the Fair
Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Grant Date. SARs may be settled at such times, and subject to restrictions and
conditions, which need not be the same for all Participants; provided that no SAR shall settle later than ten (10) years from the
Grant Date. Upon settlement, the Participant shall be entitled to receive payment of an amount determined by multiplying (a) the
difference, if any, between the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the date of settlement and the base value of one
share of Common Stock on the Grant Date; and (b) the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the SAR is settled.
Payment for SARs shall be in cash, shares of Common Stock of equivalent value, or in a combination thereof. As of September 30,
2024, the Company has not issued any SARs. 

Restricted
Stock: 

Restricted
Stock awards may be subject to transfer and other restrictions including, without limitation, continued employment, performance conditions,
or limitations on voting and/or dividend rights. Restricted Stock awards will be forfeited if the restrictions imposed on the Grant Date
have not expired at the time of termination of employment or service in the case of a non-employee director or consultant. As of September
30, 2024, the Company has not issued any Restricted Stock. 

Stock
Grant Awards: 

Stock
Grant Awards grant the Participant the right to receive (or purchase at such price as previously determined in the award) a designated
number of shares of Common Stock free of any vesting restrictions. The purchase price, if any, shall be payable in cash or other form
of consideration. Stock Grant Awards may be granted or sold in respect of past services or other valid consideration, or in lieu of any
cash compensation due to the Participant. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not issued any Stock Grant Awards. 

Stock
Options: 

Under
the Plan, Stock Options may be granted to Eligible Participants at a per-share exercise no less than 100 of the Fair Market Value of one share
of Common Stock as of the Grant Date. The Administrator shall determine when the Stock Option may be exercised, including any performance,
vesting or other conditions, provided the term does not exceed ten (10) years from the Grant Date. If the Participant s employment
or service is terminated for cause, their unexercised Stock Options immediately lapse, including any vested Stock Options. Incentive
Stock Options ISOs may only be granted to Participants who are also employees. The exercise price of ISOs shall equal
the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock as of the Grant Date and shall expire upon the earlier of ten (10) years from the
Grant Date (unless a shorter time is set in the Participant s award agreement), provided that, ISOs granted to an employee who owns stock possessing more than 10 of the total combined voting
power of all classes of stock of the Company must have a per-share exercise price of no less than 110 of the Fair Market Value of one
share of Common Stock as of the Grant Date and cannot have a term exceeding five (5) years from the Grant Date. The vested portion of
a Stock Option lapses three (3) months following the effective date
of the Participant s termination of employment or twelve (12) months following the effective date of the Participant s termination of employment due to death or disability, as
defined in the Plan (in each case, unless a shorter time is set in the Participant s award agreement) but in no event later than
the expiration of the Stock Option.

The
Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements using a fair value method which requires the recognition of compensation expense
for costs related to all share-based payments, including stock options. The fair value method requires the Company to estimate the fair
value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model
to estimate the fair value of Stock Options granted that are then expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company
accounts for forfeitures as they occur in the year of forfeiture and share-based compensation expense adjusted accordingly. Option valuation
models, including the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, require the input of highly subjective assumptions, and changes in the assumptions
used can materially affect the grant-date fair value of an award. These assumptions include the risk-free rate of interest, expected
dividend yield, expected volatility, and the expected life of the award.

Restricted
Stock Units: 

Restricted
Stock Units RSUs grant the Participant the right to receive a certain number of shares of Common Stock, a cash
payment equal to the Fair Market Value of that number of shares of Common Stock (determined as of a specified date), or a
combination thereof, based on the terms and conditions of the award, as determined by the Plan Administrator. Upon termination of employment (or
service as a non-employee director or consultant), unvested RSUs shall be forfeited. 

RSUs
represent a right to receive a single common share.
RSU awards generally and stock-based compensation is recognized over the service period. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not grant any RSUs. 

During

Total Stock-Based Compensation Expense 

The
expected life of employee stock options was estimated using the simplified method, as the Company has no historical information
to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and employment duration for its stock option grants. The simplified
method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant. The expected life of awards that vest
immediately use the contractual maturity since they are vested when issued. For stock price volatility, the Company uses public company
compatibles as a basis for its expected volatility to calculate the fair value of option grants. The risk-free interest rate is based
on U.S. Treasury notes with a term approximating the expected life of the option at the grant-date. 

The
Company recognizes stock option forfeitures as they occur as there is insufficient historical data to accurately determine future forfeiture
rates. 

Future
stock-based compensation expense related to these options and RSUs as of September 30, 2024, to be recognized is approximately
 thousand,
which is expected to be expensed over the remaining average vesting period of 
year. The amount of future stock-based compensation expense could be affected by any future option and RSU grants or by any
forfeitures.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited
consolidated financial statements and related notes for the years ended December 31, 2023 included in our most recent annual report on
Form 10-K filed on the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on April 1, 2024.. The condensed consolidated financial
statements of the Company appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited, and may not include year-end adjustments necessary
to make those financial statements comparable to audited results, although, in the opinion of management, all adjustments and disclosures
necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been included. The results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full
year. 

In
addition to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that
reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.
See above Forward-Looking Statements . 

Overview 

BOXABL
Inc. (the Company is a manufacturer of building systems and is in the process of scaling our production of Casitas 
to meet the demand for our products. In addition to our first Nevada manufacturing facility Factory 1 ), which we took
possession of in May 2021, we expanded our production capacity by signing a lease for additional Nevada facilities Factory 2 in June 2022 and Factory 3 in May 2023. While our growth has mainly been funded by our capital raising activities as
described below in Liquidity, we anticipate our increased manufacturing capacity will allow us to build Boxes more efficiently,
and, in doing so generate additional revenue in the future. We continue to improve our workforce including the expansion of our business
development and sales teams to focus and better support the B2B, B2C, and B2G channels, respectively. 

To
date, we have manufactured 659 Casitas and have completed deliveries in eight states. The majority of US states have a statewide modular
program which requires approval of a specific product prior to the product being able to be sold and installed within the state. The
requirements to obtain these approvals vary across each state, and the approval process has caused delays in the ability to deliver the
product across the country which has affected the timing and amount of the Company s revenues. Currently, the Company is in the
process of obtaining these state-by-state approvals related to the Casitas. 

The
Company has already obtained these state approvals in Arizona, New Mexico, and certain climate zones in California. The approvals were
obtained as follows: 

- 
 During
 December 2023, BOXABL completed the required third-party inspection for the State of Arizona and received a report recommending Factory
 and Casita certification which was approved by the State. 

- 
 During
 May 2024, BOXABL received approval to sell units in California in certain climate zones. 

- 
 During
 July 2024, BOXABL received approval to sell units in New Mexico. New sales within these approved states may continue to face delays
 due to the time needed for site preparation, arranging payment for the units by the purchaser, and other preparatory steps that are
 required to arrange delivery and installation of the units. 

BOXABL
currently has the ability to explore selling our product in multiple jurisdictions that do not have a statewide modular housing program.
In these areas, the ultimate approval comes down to the local jurisdiction and is determined on a site-by-site basis. This pertains to
the following areas: 

- 
 Alaska 

- 
 Hawaii 

- 
 Kansas 

- 
 Oklahoma 

- 
 Oregon 

- 
 Utah 

- 
 Vermont 

- 
 West
 Virginia 

- 
 Wyoming 

24 

BOXABL
is generally also able to sell our product as a Park Model RV under ANSI A119.5 in the majority of US states. 

The
Company retained multiple third-party inspection agencies to assist in achieving certification in multiples states with modular housing
legislation simultaneously. The Company does not expect that this regulatory process will cause further delays in our ability to generate
revenue with respect to our current or future production. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company sold eighteen units to approved states, states that do not have modular housing legislation, or under
the Park Model RV classification. 

The
Company maintains short-term liquidity (which includes cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Notes) of
 28,439 thousand and 46,259 thousand as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment loss of deposits on equipment and fixed assets totaling
 12,237 thousand. These losses are related to assets that were procured for the anticipated ramp up of the generation 2.0 Casita. Prompted
by a key supplier of equipment failing to fulfill their obligation, the Company determined that it no longer plans to continue with
production of the Generation 2.0 Casita. Considering that this equipment was customized for the production of 2.0 Casitas and is
unable to be used for an alternative purpose, the Company recognized an impairment loss. 

The
Company expects to generate funds from the sale of its current inventory in 2024, sale of future inventory resulting from manufacturing,
sales of equity securities pursuant to an offering under Regulation A, which was qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission
on June 24, 2024, sales of securities in Canadian Provinces under Canadian National Instrument 45-106 law, as well as sales to accredited
and institutional investors under Regulation D. 

Trend
Information 

In
total, we have received interest from more than 185 thousand potential customers reserving their place in line for a Casita Box. Of
that number, we currently have deposits from over 8 thousand potential customers ranging from 100 to 5,000. We are currently only
accepting deposits of 200. While there is no assurance that any of these reservations will result in binding orders or revenue, we
believe that the volume of reservations demonstrates significant interest in our product, which necessitates our efforts to focus on
scaling up production capacity. 

Between October 1, 2024 and November 12, 2024, the Company shipped 14 units, recognizing revenues
of 780 thousand. As of November 12, 2024, the Company had remaining contracts with customers for the future delivery of 102 units. 

The
Company is currently engaging in the developmental phase of an expanded product line, which includes a variety of sizes and configurations
that extend beyond our existing Casita model. The growing interest expressed by various external stakeholders including developers has
prompted us to explore additional sales channels. We anticipate the delivery of the initial prototypes in 2024. 

Inflation 

We
have not yet been materially impacted by inflationary pressures because of the key differentiators in our building components compared
to traditional, stick-built homes, as well as our manufacturing process in the factory setting compared to construction in the field.
If the Company encounters significant increases in the cost of manufacture due to inflation, we believe we would be able to pass on those
costs to end consumers as they would likely encounter greater inflationary impacts in traditionally built homes. Recent inflationary
pressures have not materially impacted the Company s operations.

Revenues 

Gross
Revenues were 854 thousand and 99 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which represents
an increase of 762 . The increase in revenues is attributable to additional shipments of our Casitas and installer training. We are
continuing to work to execute on the new sales strategy, which includes closing deals from our waitlist. On July 17, 2024, the
Company announced its new distribution program involving BOXABL dealerships through which customers can purchase Casitas, arrange
financing and installation. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of Goods Sold were 3,319 thousand and 3,476 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which
represents a decrease of 4.5 . Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost of products used in the production of the
Company s finished products, shipping, the related labor, stock compensation expense and overhead charges associated with that
production. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, manufacturing overhead was 2,574 thousand and 3,431 thousand,
respectively. This consists primarily of the allocation of indirect labor, rent and lease expense, and depreciation expense. Other
allocations to manufacturing overhead included indirect supplies, scrapped material, and maintenance costs. These overhead costs are
relatively fixed and will not increase proportionally with the increase in production or sales. 

The
cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, consist of the following:

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company continued developing and implementing strategic cost-saving initiatives to reduce
the cost of goods sold. In particular, standardizing terms and conditions with suppliers, improving manufacturing efficiencies and reducing
quality issues, implementing risk management procedures and maintaining employee engagement. In addition, the Company continued upgrading
the manufacturing concept to scale production. We expect this will allow the Company to ramp up production and reduce the cost per unit
further.

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our total operating expenses were 7,050 thousand as compared to total operating expenses
of 6,940 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which represents an increase of 1.6 . 

The
increase in total operating expenses between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is primarily attributable to sales and
marketing activities. The decrease in general and administrative expenses between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
was primarily related to lower headcount. 

General
and administrative expenses consist of compensation and benefits for positions on the factory floor and company administration, rents,
shop supplies, and utilities. As we expand production capacity and ramp up operations, we expect these expenses to continue to increase.
Sales and marketing expenses generally consist of advertising and promotions. We have undertaken advertising campaigns specific to the
product, as well as advertising directly to investors. Research and development is essential to test and develop the BOXABL product further
and reflects a push to increase capacity, sales, and further test raw material used in production and researching industry standards
and regulations. In addition, the Company recognized impairment losses in connection with a key supplier of automation equipment failing
to fulfill their obligation. For details, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations Overview. 

Compensation
Expense 

The
Company s 2021 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of Stock Options (including both ISO s and NQSO s)
and Restricted Stock Units RSUs ). The RSUs granted by the Board vest depending upon future events and are expensed
periodically, over the vesting term. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 50,786 thousand and 60,500
thousand RSUs outstanding. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 286 thousand and 286 thousand RSU shares, respectively,
were fully vested. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 50,200 thousand and 55,236 thousand shares
underlying stock options, respectively, outstanding. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company recognized 1,750 thousand and 2,953 thousand in stock-based
compensation, respectively. The decrease in 2024 is attributed to employee forfeitures upon termination. 

Total
Other Income and Expenses 

Total
other income and expenses include income and expenses that are not included in the ordinary day-to-day activities of our business. This
includes interest and accretion expenses on our financing arrangements, fair value gains or losses on our financial instruments and/or
investments, and income earned from arrangements that are not from our ordinary revenue streams selling our Casitas products. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our total other income was 480 thousand as compared to total other income of 778
thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which represents a decrease of 38 . 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

Gross
Revenues were 1,562 thousand and 197 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which
represents an increase of 693 . The increase in revenues is attributable to the sales of our Casitas, including the shipment of 18
Casitas to six customers. As discussed above, we are continuing to work to execute on the new sales strategy, which includes closing
deals from our waitlist. On July 17, 2024, the Company announced its new distribution program involving BOXABL dealerships through
which customers can purchase Casitas, arrange financing and installation. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of Goods Sold were 10,651 thousand and 7,525 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which
represents an increase of 42 . Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost of products used in the production of the
Company s finished products, shipping, the related labor, stock compensation expense and overhead charges associated with that
production. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, manufacturing overhead was 9,243 thousand and 7,525 thousand,
respectively. This consisted primarily of the allocation of indirect labor, rent and lease expense, and depreciation expense. Other
allocations to Manufacturing Overhead included indirect supplies, scrapped material, and maintenance costs. These overhead costs are
relatively fixed and will not increase proportionally with the increase in production or sales. 

27 

The
cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, consist of the following:

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company continued developing and implementing strategic cost-saving initiatives to reduce
the cost of goods sold. In particular, standardizing terms and conditions with suppliers, improving manufacturing efficiencies and reducing
quality issues, implementing risk management procedures and maintaining employee engagement. In addition, the Company continued upgrading
the manufacturing concept. We expect this will allow the Company to ramp up production and reduce the cost per unit further.

75.4 . 

The
increase in total operating expenses between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is primarily attributable to sales and
marketing activities, research and development for our next generation product, and the impairment loss related to the Brave equipment.
The decrease in general and administrative expenses between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily related to
lower headcount. 

General
and administrative expenses consist of compensation and benefits for positions on the factory floor and company administration, rents,

to the product, as well as advertising directly to investors. Research and development is essential to test and develop the BOXABL product
further and reflects a push to increase capacity, sales, and further test raw material used in production and researching industry standards

automation equipment failing to fulfill their obligations. For details, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations Overview.

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company recognized 6,675 thousand and 5,823 thousand in stock-based
compensation, respectively. The increase is attributable to RSUs issued under the Company s 2021 stock incentive plan during
the second quarter of 2023. 

Total
Other Income and Expenses 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total other income was 1,550 thousand as compared to total other income of 2,445
thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which represents a decrease of 36.6 . 

The
decrease in total other income between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is primarily attributable to lower balances
of interest-bearing deposits. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Sources
of Liquidity 

To
date, our operations have been primarily financed by our exempt offerings of securities made in reliance on Regulation A, Regulation
CF and both Rule 506(c) and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D. For details regarding our securities offerings, see below Sales of Securities. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company held 6,650 thousand in cash and cash equivalents and 21,789 thousand in investments in
short-term treasury notes, compared to 18,574 thousand in cash and cash equivalents and 27,685 thousand in investments in
short-term treasury notes as of December 31, 2023. 

Historical
Cash Flows 

On
September 30, 2024, our principal source of liquidity was cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments, which we achieved
through our offerings of securities as discussed above. Based on the Company s current burn rate, we anticipate that the current
short-term liquidity will be sufficient to meet our immediate cash needs for approximately 14.9 months.

Operating
Activities 

Cash
used in operating activities included net loss adjusted for several non-cash items such as depreciation amortization, stock-based
compensation, impairment loss and other non-cash expenses, in addition to the change in working capital. 

29 

Investing
Activities 

Primary
investing activities included purchase of Property, equipment, leasehold improvement, Payment of security deposit for our factory and
other facility, and acquisition and sales of short-term and long-term investments. The decrease in cash flows provided by Investing activities
was due to a large sale of investments (U.S. Treasuries) during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Financing
Activities 

Primary
sources of our financial activities included net proceeds from issuance and sales of securities. The Company saw an increase in cash
flows provided by financing activities primarily due to the offering of securities under regulation A during 2024. 

Inventory 

Our
physical assets increased with inventory of 22,955 thousand as of September 30, 2024, which is primarily finished goods including
398 Casita Boxes units, compared to 18,694 thousand as of December 31, 2023, which is primarily finished goods, including 313
Casita Boxes units. As we continue producing Casita Boxes, the amount of inventory consisting of finished goods has increased
compared to the amount of raw materials in inventory. 

Property,
Plant and Equipment 

Property,
Plant and Equipment decreased to 9,512 thousand as of September 30, 2024, from 10,766 thousand at December 31, 2023 resulting from
impairment of equipment offset by capital improvements to our manufacturing facility, less depreciation and impairments. 

In
addition to installed capital equipment, as of September 30, 2024, we recorded 51 thousand in deposits related to production
equipment, compared to 9,822 thousand as of December 31, 2023, which decreased due to impairments.

Our long-term lease liability decreased to 8,068 thousand as of September 30, 2024, from 10,661 thousand as of December 31, 2023
due to the passage of time. 

Customer
Deposits 

The
Company records its obligation to customers who have placed deposits on the purchase of a Casita as customer deposits on its
unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held Customer deposits in the amount
of 3,660 thousand, a decrease from 3,987 thousand as of December 31, 2023. This decrease is due to refunds and/or application of
customer deposits to customer orders that were fulfilled. 

30 

Deferred
Revenue 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recorded 2,862 thousand and 2,684 thousand of deferred revenue related to purchase
orders from Oklahoma and the Purchase Agreement with Pronghorn Services LLC (included as Exhibit 10.8) . The Company received
the full payment of the purchase orders ahead of shipping units). Pursuant to ASC 606, Revenue Recognition, the Company records
deferred revenue for paid, unfulfilled performance obligations which are represented by the Casitas or installer training sessions
that had not yet been delivered as of the date of these consolidated financial statements. 

Going
Concern 

These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that
the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
is probable. Primarily due to a decline in sales associated with delays in obtaining US statewide modular approvals, the Company reported
a net loss of 42,921 thousand, an operating cash outflow of 28,632 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September
30, 2024 the Company had an accumulated deficit of 710,406 thousand. Absent any other action, the Company will require additional liquidity
to continue its operations over the next 12 months. 

The continuing viability of the Company and its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company
being successful in its continued efforts in growing its revenue and/or accessing additional sources of capital. Management s plan
to address this need includes (a) continued exercise of tight controls to conserve cash, (b) accelerating sales of Casitas to generate
revenue, and (c) raising funds through equity financing. The Company anticipates current capital on hand and expected future funding will
be sufficient to fund the Company s operations in excess of twelve months. The Company is currently selling shares of its preferred
stock through Regulation A and Regulation D offerings in the United States, securities offerings in Canada, and anticipates raising funds
through other offerings of preferred stock. Management believes that the actions presently being taken by the Company will provide sufficient
liquidity for the Company to continue to execute its business plan over the next year. However, there can be no assurances that management s
plans will be achieved. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Inventory 

Inventory
consists of raw materials, in-bound freight and duties, work in progress, and finished goods. Inventories available for sale are valued
at the lower of cost or net realized value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. This valuation requires us to make
judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers,
bulk sales, and the expected recoverable values for each disposition category. On a periodic basis, the Company performs a physical count
of its inventory and records an Inventory Valuation Allowance for inventory that has become obsolete or inventory that has a cost basis
in excess of the expected net realizable value. Damaged and obsolete inventory are valued based on management s best estimate and
any difference charged to expense. 

Intangible
Assets 

Intangible
assets are amortized over the respective estimated lives on a straight-line basis unless the lives are determined to be indefinite and
reviewed for impairment whenever events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The
Company s intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life of 14 years, or the stated expiration date, whichever
is more determinable. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company applies ASC 718 for its Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation for all stock-based awards, including stock options and restricted
stock, are measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the associated vesting periods. The fair value of stock options
is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model. The fair value of restricted stock awards is estimated on the date of
the grant based on the fair value of the Company s underlying common stock. The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock
options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the associated service or vesting periods. 

31 

Determining
the grant date fair value of options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires management to make assumptions and judgments.
These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and, if different assumptions had been used, stock-based compensation expense could have
been materially different from the amounts recorded. 

Planned
Timeline 

With
the success of our initial fundraising through our offerings under Regulation A, Regulation D, and Regulation CF, we have continued to
advance our planned timeline beyond initial testing of Casitas, delivery of orders, and developing Factory 2 and 3. As of October 25,
2024, we see our next 12-month timeline as follows: 

Month 1-3 
 
 Continued delivery
 of orders to states that do not have modular housing legislation, Park Model RV configuration, and sales of Modular homes to California,
 to New Mexico and to Arizona. Costs are estimated to be 3 million. 

Obtain
 plant and Casita certification in Florida and Texas. Costs are estimated to be 100 per state. 
 
 Complete
 the design and prototyping of our next Generation of Boxes (new sizes) and begin production of these generations. Costs are estimated
 to be 9 million. 

Month 4-6 
 
 Begin and complete ramp
 up of production to achieve our desired production at scale for our facilities 

Month 7+ 
 
 Obtain next generation
 Casita certification in several states including Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas and Nevada. Costs are estimated to be 100
 per state. 

The
Company believes the above referenced activities are achievable with its current cash and cash equivalents as referenced in Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview. 

There
is no assurance that we will be able to meet this timeline. It is provided to identify our intentions for moving forward during the next
12 months of operations.

As
a smaller reporting company as defined by 229.10(f)(1), BOXABL is not required to provide the information under this Item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

The
term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the Exchange Act ), refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design
of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact there are resource constraints and management are required to apply judgment
in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management,
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated as of the end of the period covered
by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Employment
Matters 

On
or about June 13, 2023, the Company filed two lawsuits against former employees alleging claims including breach of contract, violations
of the Computer Fraud Abuse Act, violations of the Defend Trade Secrets Act, conversion, unjust enrichment, breach of covenant
of good faith and fair dealing, and demand for temporary and permanent injunctive relief. These litigation matters remain pending. Management
does not anticipate these matters will have a material impact on the Company s results of operations or financial condition. 

The
Company is addressing a situation where a former employee violated their confidentiality agreement post-termination. Quantifying the
resulting harm is complex and ongoing. Legal action has been initiated in Nevada State Court against the former employee, with efforts
underway to fulfill court requirements for service. The Company s claim is straightforward, and it anticipates a judgment in its
favor, likely resulting in a recovery below 250 thousand. 

On
September 2, 2022, BOXABL received notice of a charge of employment discrimination had been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission EEOC against BOXABL under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII). The circumstances of the
alleged discrimination are alleged to have occurred on or about May 1, 2022. On October 3, 2022, BOXABL (through counsel) filed a position
statement refuting the allegations and providing supporting documentation of BOXABL s position. The matter is pending before the
EEOC. Management does not anticipate this matter will have a material impact on the Company s results of operations or financial
condition. 

On
or about September 25, 2023, BOXABL received notice of a charge of unfair labor practices had been filed with the National Labor Relations
Board against BOXABL under Section 7 of the NLRA. The circumstances of the alleged charge are alleged to have occurred between March
2023 and September 2023. On or about October 12, 2023, BOXABL (through counsel) filed a position statement refuting the allegations and
providing supporting documentation of BOXABL s position. The matter is pending before the NLRB. Management does not anticipate
this matter will have a material impact on the Company s results of operations or financial condition. 

On
May 7, 2024, BOXABL received notification that a former employee filed a charge of employment discrimination against BOXABL with the
EEOC under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII). The alleged discrimination involves claims of race-based discrimination,
retaliation, and harassment. On the same day, BOXABL engaged external legal counsel to submit a Position Statement, contesting these
allegations and providing supporting documentation. The matter is currently under review by the EEOC and has not progressed to a formal
court case. Management does not anticipate this matter will have a material impact on the Company s results of operations or financial
condition. 

Other
Litigation 

On
July 3, 2024, Ro-Matt International Inc. and Electra-Tech Manufacturing Inc. Applicants filed a lawsuit against Brave
Control Solutions, Inc., BOXABL Inc., and Royal Bank of Canada in Ontario, Canada, in the Superior Court of Justice. The Applicants seek
an Order for binding directions on the costs associated with the storage and removal of the Assembly Line Equipment, the sale process,
and the distribution of sale proceeds among competing parties. Counsel for BOXABL is arranging for BOXABL s dismissal from the
case. Management does not anticipate the dismissal will have a material impact on the Company s results of operations or financial
condition. 

On
April 30, 2024, the Company filed a lawsuit against Brave Control Solutions, Inc. Brave ), and its CEO, Brent McPhail.
The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The lawsuit related to the Company s
claim of breach of contract by Brave related to the design, manufacture, and programing of specialized equipment to be used by the Company.
Management does not believe this litigation will have a material effect on the Company s operations. Although recovery of these
assets is uncertain, the Company intends to seek full redress available to it. 

33 

On
June 13, 2023, the Company filed a lawsuit against a person, not affiliated with the Company, alleging claims based on business
disparagement and defamation of the Company. On August 5, 2024, the court entered a default judgment in favor of the Company,
awarding 50 thousand in damages. Management plans to pursue all legal remedies and compensation that it is entitled to under the
law. 

On
November 19, 2021, a former employee, who served as Chief Operating Officer during the seven-month period from March 2021 until September
27, 2021, at which time he was terminated, filed a complaint against the Company and its directors in the Eighth Judicial District Court
of Clark County, Nevada, claiming breach of contract and wrongful termination. While the legal action has proceeded to discovery, the
Company denies the merit of the allegations and will continue to defend against them. Management does not anticipate these matters will
have a material impact on the Company s results of operations or financial condition. 

On
or about October 5, 2023, Leader Capital High Quality Income Fund, a series of Leader Funds Trust, a Delaware statutory trust, commenced
an action against BOXABL and other defendants in the District Court for Nevada asserting claims for breach of duty to register a transfer
of a security (NRS 104.8401), Conversion, Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage. Plaintiff claims that it requested
the removal of a restrictive legend to shares held by Plaintiff and that BOXABL refused and/or delayed approval of the removal and caused
Plaintiff to suffer damages. The Company has agreed to provide a defense to Transfer Online and
we have been engaged in defending the lawsuit. The discovery phase has not yet commenced, and it is difficult to quantify the potential
for liability at this early stage of the litigation. BOXABL denies the merit of the allegations and damages sought and will continue
to defend against them. Management does not anticipate these matters will have a material impact on the Company s results of operations
or financial condition. 

We
know of no other existing or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any proceeding or pending litigation.
There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or any of their respective affiliates, or any beneficial stockholder,
is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. 

The
Company is party to various legal proceedings and claims from time to time. A liability will be accrued when a loss is both probable
and can be reasonably estimated. Management believes that the probability of a material loss is remote. However, litigation is inherently
uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate disposition of these proceedings.
