units (the Units and, with respect to the Ordinary Shares included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares ), at per Unit, generating gross proceeds of (the Initial Public Offering , or IPO ), and incurring offering costs of . The Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional Units at the Initial Public Offering price to cover over-allotments, if any. As of September 13, 2024, the over-allotment option was exercised, generating gross proceeds of and deposited into the Trust Account. Meanwhile, ordinary shares were issued to the underwriter at the closing of the IPO as representative shares Representative Shares ), and representative shares will be issued as the deferred underwriting commission at the consummation of a Business Combination. 

Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of units (the Placement Units to the Sponsor at a price of per Unit, generating gross proceeds of (the Private Placement ). (see Note 4). 

The Company s initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target sufficient for the post-transaction company not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. 

Following the closing of the IPO on September 13, 2024, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Placement Units was placed in a trust account Trust Account and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, with a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company. The proceeds from this offering held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account (1) to the Company, until the completion of the initial business combination, or (2) to public shareholders, until the earliest of: (a) the completion of the initial Business Combination, (b) the redemption of any ordinary shares sold as part of the units in this offering (the public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company s second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to provide holders of the Company s ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with the Company s initial business combination or to redeem 100 of the Company s public shares if the Company does not complete the initial business combination March 13, 2026 or up to September 13, 2026 (an Extension Period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of the Company s ordinary shares, and (c) the redemption of the Company s public shares if it has not consummated the business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering or during any Extension Period, subject to applicable law. Public shareholders who redeem their ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (b) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if the Company has not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering, with respect to such ordinary shares so redeemed. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company s public shareholders. 

The shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially 10.05 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter. The ordinary shares subject to redemption will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the IPO, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. The Company will have only 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or during any Extension Period to complete the initial Business Combination (the Combination Period ). If the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company for working capital purposes or to pay the Company s taxes (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and its board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete the Business Combination within the 18 months from the closing of this offering or during any Extension Period. 

The Founder shares except as described below, are identical to the ordinary shares included in the units being sold in this offering, and holders of Founder shares have the same shareholder rights as public shareholders, except that (a) prior to the initial business combination, only holders of the founder shares have the right to vote on the appointment of directors and holders of a majority of the founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason; (b) in a vote to continue the company in a jurisdiction outside of the Cayman Islands, holders of founder shares will have ten votes for every founder share and holders of ordinary shares will have one vote for every ordinary share; (c) the Founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below; (d) the Company s initial shareholder has entered into an agreement with the Company, pursuant to which they have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder shares in connection with the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder shares and public shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company s second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to provide for the redemption of the Company s public shares in connection with an initial Business Combination or to redeem 100 of the Company s public shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering or during any Extension Period, and (B) with respect to any other provisions relating to shareholders rights, and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder shares if w the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering or during any Extension Period, (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public shares they hold if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame), and I are entitled to registration rights. If the Company submits its initial Business Combination to its public shareholders for a vote, its founder has agreed (and its permitted transferees will agree) to vote their Founder shares, private shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of its initial Business Combination. The other members of the Company s management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by the Company s Sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering. 

The Company will have until 18 months from the closing of the IPO (or up to 24 months from the closing of this offering if the Company extends the period of time to consummate a Business Combination by up to six additional months through six one-month extensions of time, as further provided in the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) to consummate a Business Combination (the Combination Period ). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to the Company to pay its franchise and income taxes as well as expenses relating to the administration of the trust account (less up to of interest released to the Company to pay taxes and potentially, dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under the Companies Act to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

The underwriter has agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the IPO price per Unit 10.05). 

The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or by a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) 10.05 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than 10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then the Company s Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. 

Going Concern Consideration 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had of cash in its operating bank account. 

The Company s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the IPO were satisfied through the payment of from the Sponsor to cover for certain offering costs on the Company s behalf in exchange for issuance of Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5), and loan from the Sponsor of under the Promissory Note (as defined in Note 5). The Company repaid the Promissory Note in full shortly after receipt of funds in the operating bank account from the Trust Account. Subsequent to the consummation of the IPO, the Company s liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 5). As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loan. 

The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of the consummation of an initial Business Combination. In addition, the Company initially has until March 13, 2026 to consummate the initial Business Combination (assume no extensions). If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the prescribed timeline, the Company will trigger an automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. Notwithstanding management s belief that the Company would have sufficient funds to execute its business strategy, there is a possibility that business combination might not happen within the 18-month period from the issuance date of these financial statements. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should a business combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, management has determined that such additional condition raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern until the earlier of the consummation of the Business Combination or the date the Company is required to liquidate. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the Company s inability to consummate the initial Business Combination to continue as a going concern. 

Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

consisting of and of underwriting commissions which were paid in cash and representative shares (57,500 ordinary shares)
at the closing date of the IPO, respectively and of other offering costs. 

.
The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on
such account. 

Ordinary Shares sold as part of the Units in the IPO contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 

The Company accounted for its ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480). Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) were classified as a liability instrument and will be measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control) were classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares were classified as stockholders equity. In accordance with ASC 480-10-S99, the Company classified the ordinary shares subject to redemption outside of permanent equity as the redemption provisions are not solely within the control of the Company. 

Given that the ordinary shares sold as part of the units in the IPO were issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., rights), the initial carrying value of ordinary shares classified as temporary equity has been allocated to the proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either (i) accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or (ii) recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes in redemption value as a charge against additional paid-in-capital over an expected 18-month period, which is the initial period that the Company has to complete a Business Combination. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024
and for the period from January 30, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, the Company recorded accretion of ordinary share subject
to redemption value of .

The Company determined that the Cayman Islands
is the Company s only major tax jurisdiction. 

The Company may be subject to potential examination
by taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions,
the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company s
management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. 

There is currently no taxation imposed on income

All of the public
shares sold as part of the Public Units in the IPO contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such public shares
if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to
the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, or in connection with the Company s liquidation.
In accordance with the SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99,
redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside
of permanent equity. 

The Company s redeemable
ordinary share is subject to SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99.
If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either accrete changes in the redemption
value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable,
if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur
and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected
to accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance which is the IPO date. The accretion or remeasurement
is treated as a deemed dividend and charged against additional paid-in capital. 

Placement Units at a price of per Placement Unit raising in the aggregate. 

The proceeds from the sale of the Placement Units

Any permitted transferees would be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of our sponsor, directors and executive officers with respect to any founder shares. 

Promissory Note Related Party 

On February 22, 2024, the Company issued a promissory note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of (the Promissory Note to be used for a portion of the expenses for the IPO. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier of (1) September 30, 2024 or (2) the closing of the IPO. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of the IPO out of the offering proceeds not held in the Trust Account. 

The Company had borrowed under the Promissory Note with the Sponsor for its IPO. Shortly after completion of the IPO, such amount was fully repaid. As of September 30, 2024, amounts under the Promissory Note have been drawn. 

Working Capital Loans 

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, the Sponsor, the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required. If the Company completes the initial Business Combination, it intends to repay such loaned amount at closing. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to of such working capital loans Working Capital Loans made by the Sponsor, the Company s officers and directors, or the Company s or their affiliates to the Company prior to or in connection with its initial Business Combination may be convertible into units, at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender, upon consummation of its initial Business Combination. The units would be identical to the Placement Units. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had borrowings under the Working Capital Loans. 

Administrative Services Arrangement 

Commencing on the effective date of the registration statement of the IPO, the Company has agreed to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a total of per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of its initial Business Combination or its liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees.

an aggregate of shares that are subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriter s over-allotment option is not
exercised in full or in part, so that the initial shareholder will own 20 of the Company s issued and outstanding ordinary shares
(excluding the Private Placement Units and Representative shares (as defined below) and assuming the initial shareholder does not purchase
any shares in the IPO). Meanwhile, the Sponsor irrevocably surrendered to the Company for cancellation and for nil consideration 
ordinary shares. 

As of September 30, 2024, as a result of
closing of the IPO and the exercise of the Representative s Over-Allotment Option on September 13, 2024, there were 
ordinary shares issued and outstanding, including ordinary shares subject to possible redemption. 

Rights 

As of September 30, 2024, there were 
public rights and private rights include in the Placement Units outstanding. There was no right attached to the Representative

Company will not be the surviving company upon completion of our initial business combination, each holder of a right will be required
to affirmatively convert his, her or its rights in order to receive the one-tenth (1/10) of a share of the Company underlying each right
upon consummation of the business combination unless otherwise waived in the course of the business combination. No fractional shares

share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of Cayman Law. If the Company is unable to complete an initial
Business Combination within the required time period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights
will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets
held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless. Further, there are no contractual
penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of an initial Business Combination. Accordingly,
the rights may expire worthless. 

Representative Shares

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

References to the Company, Future Vision, our, us or we refer to Future Vision II Acquisition Corp. The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward- looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, could, would, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, continue, or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in our other U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings. 

Overview 

We are a blank check company incorporated on January
30, 2024, as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share
purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have not selected any business combination target
and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination
target. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the initial public offering (the IPO and the private placement of the private placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our securities in connection with our initial business
combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of this offering
or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to banks or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination
of the foregoing. 

On September 13, 2024, we consummated our IPO
of 5,000,000 Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 50,000,000, and incurring offering costs of 1,845,513. We granted
the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 750,000 Units at the IPO price to cover over-allotments, if any. As of
September 13, 2024, the over-allotment option was exercised, generating gross proceeds of 7,500,000 and deposited into the Trust Account.
Meanwhile, 57,500 ordinary shares were issued to the underwriter at the closing of the IPO as representative shares, and 28,750 representative
shares will be issued as the deferred underwriting commission at the consummation of a Business Combination. 

Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing
of the IPO, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 299,000 units to the Sponsor at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating
gross proceeds of 2,990,000. 

Following the closing of the IPO on September
13, 2024, an amount of 57,500,000 10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and a portion of the proceeds
from the sale of the Placement Units was placed in a trust account Trust Account and established for the benefit of the
Company s public shareholders and the underwriters of the IPO with Wilmington Trust, National Association acting as trustee. 

Currently, we have no revenue, have had losses
since inception from incurring formation and operating costs and have had no operations other than identifying and evaluating suitable
acquisition transaction candidates. We have relied upon the working capital available to us following the consummation of the IPO and
the Private Placement (as defined below) to fund our operations, as well as the funds loaned by the Sponsor (as defined below), our officers,
directors or their affiliates. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure
you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful. 

19 

Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future
Events 

We have neither
engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities
and those necessary to prepare for our IPO. Following our IPO, we will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our
initial business combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents after
our IPO. There has been no significant change in our financial position and no
material adverse change has occurred since February 29, 2024, the date of our audited financial statements .
We expect that we will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and
auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with completing a business combination. 

For the period from
January 30, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 137,178, which consists of income earned on marketable
securities held in trust account of 147,779, interest income earned on bank account of 712 and operating expenses of 11,313.
For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 141,906, which consists of income earned on marketable securities
held in trust account and cash account of 147,779, interest income earned on bank account of 712 and operating expenses of 6,585. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

For the period from
January 30, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 14,703. As of September 30, 2024,
we had cash of 1,464,303 available for working capital needs. All marketable securities are
held in the Trust Account and is generally unavailable for our use, prior to an initial
business combination, and is restricted for use either in a business combination or to redeem the ordinary shares. As of September 30,
2024, none of the amount on marketable securities in the Trust Account was available
to be withdrawn as described above. 

We intend to use
substantially all of the net proceeds of the IPO, including the marketable securities held in the Trust Account ,
to acquire a target business or businesses and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including deferred underwriting commissions of 575,000
payable to Kingswood Capital Partners, LLC in cash, the representative of the underwriters of the IPO. To the extent that our share capital
is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account
as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such
working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business operations, for
strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay
any operating expenses or finders fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our initial business combination if the
funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses. 

Over the next 12 months (assuming
a business combination is not consummated prior thereto), we will be using the funds held outside of the Trust Account for identifying
and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing business due diligence on prospective target businesses, traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses, reviewing corporate documents and material agreements
of prospective target businesses, selecting the target business to acquire and structuring, negotiating and consummating the business
combination. 

If our estimates of the costs
of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do
so, or the amount of interest available to us from the Trust Account is less than we expect as a result of the current interest rate environment,
we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain
additional financing either to consummate our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number
of our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur
debt in connection with such business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only consummate such
financing simultaneously with the consummation of our initial business combination. Following our initial business combination, if cash
on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 

20 

As of September 30, 2024, we had
cash of 1,464,303 and a working capital of 1,393,405. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant professional costs
to remain as a publicly traded company and to incur significant transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a business combination.
In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting
Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern, management has determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Our management s plan in addressing this uncertainty is funds loaned from our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates.
In addition, if we are unable to complete a business combination by March 31, 2026 (or up to September 30, 2026 if extended) Combination
Period ), our board of directors would proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of us. There
is no assurance that our plans to consummate a business combination will be successful within the Combination Period. As a result, management
has determined that such additional conditions also raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial
statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, we have no obligations,
assets or liabilities that would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established
for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements,
established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual Obligations 

As of September 30, 2024, we do not have any long-term
debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. 

We are obligated to pay the underwriters a deferred
underwriting commission equal to 1.0 of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or 575,000, will be paid to the underwriters in cash from the
funds held in the Trust Account, and 28,750 representative shares will be issued at the consummation of a Business Combination. 

The founder shares, the Ordinary Shares included
in the Private Units, and any Ordinary Shares that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any underlying securities)
will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the IPO. The holders
of these securities are entitled to make up to two demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition,
the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our
completion of our initial business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration
statements. 

Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates 

In preparing these financial statements
in conformity with US GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported expenses during the reporting
period. 

Making estimates requires management
to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set
of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could
change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, actual results may differ from these estimates. We have
identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates: 

Marketable Securities Held in Trust Account 

As of September 30, 2024, all of the assets
held in the Trust Account were held in U.S. Treasury Securities Money Market Funds. All of the Company s investments held in the
Trust Account are classified as marketable securities. Marketable securities are presented on the condensed balance sheet at fair value
at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of marketable securities held in Trust Account
are included in income earned on marketable securities held in Trust Account in the accompanying condensed statement of operations. The
estimated fair values of marketable securities held in Trust Account are determined using available market information. As of September 30,
2024, the estimated fair value of marketable securities held in Trust Account was 57,935,279. 

21 

Offering Costs Associated with the Initial
Public Offering 

Offering costs consisted of legal, accounting,
underwriting fees and other costs incurred through the IPO that were directly related to the IPO. Offering cost amounted to 1,845,513,
consisting of 862,500 and 522,019 of underwriting commissions which were paid in cash and representative shares (57,500 ordinary shares)
at the closing date of the IPO, respectively and 460,994 of other offering costs. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

ASC Topic 820 Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value, the methods used to measure fair value and the expanded disclosures about fair
value measurements. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between the buyer and the seller at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the valuation techniques consistent with the market
approach, income approach and cost approach shall be used to measure fair value. ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for
inputs, which represent the assumptions used by the buyer and seller in pricing the asset or liability. These inputs are further defined
as observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are those that buyer and seller would use in pricing the asset or liability based
on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company s assumptions about the
inputs that the buyer and seller would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the
circumstances. 

The fair value hierarchy is categorized
into three levels based on the inputs as follows: 

Level
 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
 to access. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not being applied. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are
 readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment. 

Level
 2 - Valuations based on (i) quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, (ii) quoted prices in markets that
 are not active for identical or similar assets, (iii) inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities, or (iv) inputs
 that are derived principally from or corroborated by market through correlation or other means. 

Level
 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 

The fair value of the Company s assets and
liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820 approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying
balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities held in trust account, accounts payable and accrued expenses and due to related parties, each
qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period between the origination
of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. 

Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption 

All of the 5,750,000 Ordinary Shares sold as part
of the Units in the IPO contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s
liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain
amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 

The Company accounted for its ordinary shares
subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity 
(ASC 480). Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) were classified as a liability instrument and will be measured at
fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that features redemption rights that are either within
the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control)
were classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares were classified as stockholders equity. In accordance
with ASC 480-10-S99, the Company classified the ordinary shares subject to redemption outside of permanent equity as the redemption provisions
are not solely within the control of the Company. 

Given that the 5,750,000 ordinary shares sold
as part of the units in the IPO were issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., rights), the initial carrying value of ordinary
shares classified as temporary equity has been allocated to the proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20. If it is probable that
the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either (i) accrete changes in the redemption value over the
period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the
earliest redemption date of the instrument or (ii) recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the
carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize
the changes in redemption value as a charge against additional
paid-in-capital over an expected 18-month period, which is the initial period that the Company has to complete a Business Combination. 

22 

Net Income (Loss) Per Ordinary Share 

The Company complies with accounting and disclosure
requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share . The unaudited condensed statements of operations include
a presentation of income (loss) per redeemable share and income (loss) per non-redeemable share following the two-class method of income
per share. In order to determine the net income (loss) attributable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares, the Company
first considered the undistributed income (loss) allocable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares and the undistributed
income (loss) is calculated using the total net income (loss) less any dividends paid. The Company then allocated the undistributed income
(loss) ratably based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding between the redeemable and non-redeemable shares. Any remeasurement
of the accretion to redemption value of the shares subject to possible redemption was considered to be dividends paid to the public shareholders.
For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and for the period from January 30, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, the Company
did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then
share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted income (loss) per share is the same as basic loss per share for the period
presented. 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC
740 Income Taxes ASC 740 ). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected
impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit
to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when
it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

ASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process
for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits
to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides
guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition. 

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest
and penalties as of September 30, 2024. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant
payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. 

The Company determined that the Cayman Islands
is the Company s only major tax jurisdiction. 

The Company may be subject to potential examination
by taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions,
the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company s management does
not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. 

There is currently no taxation imposed on income
by the Government of the Cayman Islands for the period from January 30, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which requires

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our Management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report include the risk factors described in the registration statements on Form S-1 for our IPO filed with the SEC. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the previously disclosed risk factors. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

On February 27, 2024, our Sponsor paid an aggregate of 25,000, or approximately 0.017 per share, for the purchase of 1,437,500 founder shares, par value 0.0001. Our Sponsor is an accredited investor for purposes of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Each of the equity holders in our Sponsor are accredited investors under Rule 501(a) of Regulation D. The sole business of our Sponsor is to act as the Company s sponsor in connection with this offering. 

On September 13, 2024, we consummated its IPO
of 5,000,000 Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 50,000,000. We granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase
up to an additional 750,000 Units at the IPO price to cover over-allotments. As of September 13, 2024, the over-allotment option was exercised,
generating gross proceeds of 7,500,000 and deposited into the Trust Account. Meanwhile, 57,500 ordinary shares were issued to the underwriter
at the closing of the IPO as representative shares, and 28,750 representative shares will be issued as the deferred underwriting commission
at the consummation of a Business Combination. The securities sold in the IPO were sold pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1
(File No.: 333-272605). The registration statement became effective on September 11, 2023. 

Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing
of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 299,000 units to the Sponsor at a price of 10.00 per Unit,
generating gross proceeds of 2,990,000. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO except that the holder has agreed
not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the
Registration Statement) until the completion of the Company s initial business combination. The sponsor was granted certain demand
and piggy-back registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units. The issuance was made pursuant to the exemption
from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 

On September 13,
2024, a total of 57,787,500 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account established
for the benefit of the public shareholders and for the period from January 30, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, income earned
on marketable securities held in Trust Account were 147,779, resulted in fair value of marketable securities held in Trust Account of 57,935,279.

Transaction costs of the Initial Public Offering
with the exercise of the over-allotment amounted to 1,845,513, consisting of 862,500 of underwriting commissions which were paid in cash and 522,019 of underwriting commissions which
were paid in representative shares (57,500 ordinary shares), at the closing date of the
IPO, respectively and 460,994 of other offering costs.

of the IPO, or 575,000, will be paid in cash, and 28,750 representative shares will be issued, both of which as the deferred underwriting
commission at the consummation of a Business Combination.
