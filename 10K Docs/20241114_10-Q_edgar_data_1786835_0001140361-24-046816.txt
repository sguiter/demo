Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (including those relating to current and future market conditions and trends in respect thereof) that are not historical facts are based on
 current expectations, estimates, projections, opinions and/or beliefs of Star Mountain Lower Middle-Market Capital Corp. (the Company ), Star Mountain Fund Management, LLC (the Advisor and Star Mountain Capital, LLC Star
 Mountain ). Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. Certain information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitutes
 forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, should, seek, expect, anticipate, project, estimate, intend, continue, target, or believe or
 the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. Due to various risks and uncertainties, actual events or results or the actual performance of the Company may differ materially from those reflected or
 contemplated in such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company s control and are difficult to
 predict, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements including, without limitation, the risks, uncertainties and other factors the Company identifies in the
 section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ).

Although the Company believes that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, some of those assumptions are based on the work of third parties and any of those
 assumptions could prove to be inaccurate; as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could prove to be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or
 forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that the Company s plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or
 identified in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this
 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information contained herein, except as required by applicable law. The safe harbor
 provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form
 10-Q because the Company is an investment company.

The following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from the Company s forward-looking statements:

the Company s future operating results;

changes in the general interest rate environment;

inflation could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company s portfolio companies;

the Company s business prospects and the prospects of the Company s prospective portfolio companies;

the impact of increased competition;

the Company s contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;

the dependence of the Company s future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which the Company invests;

the ability of the Company s prospective portfolio companies to achieve their objectives;

the relative and absolute performance of the Advisor;

the ability of the Advisor and its affiliates to retain talented professionals;

risks associated with possible disruptions in the Company s operations or the economy generally due to war, terrorism or other disruptive geopolitical events domestically and/or globally;

the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Russia, including sanctions and market volatility related to such conflict, may adversely impact the industries and portfolio companies in which the Company invests;

the impact of future acquisitions and divestitures;

the Company s regulatory structure as a business development company BDC and tax status as a regulated investment company (a RIC and

future changes in laws or regulations and conditions in the Company s operating areas.

Overview:

Star Mountain Lower Middle-Market Corp. is an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, as amended. In
 addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company has elected to be treated and intends to continue to be treated as a RIC under the subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As such, the Company is
 required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70 of the Company s assets in qualifying assets, source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the
 requirement to distribute annually at least 90 of the Company s taxable income.

The Company s investment objectives are to generate current income and capital appreciation. The Company seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing primarily in privately negotiated loans
 and equity investments to SMBs generally with annual revenues greater than 15 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of less than 50 million. Generally, these businesses are owner-operated with an
 average 20+ year operating history. To accomplish this, the Company makes direct investments in SMBs and makes investments in investment funds focused primarily on investing in SMBs generally not owned by large private equity firms.

The Company seeks to provide investors with access to a diversified portfolio of credit investments generating current income distributions with equity upside. Capital protection is achieved through
 defensive structures with affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and active portfolio management which results in generally low volatility and low correlation to public market indices. The Company aims to target
 diversification of assets by vintage, industry and geography through direct originations and acquisitions of loan portfolios.

The Company s investment strategy may be complemented by secondary fund investments and secondary loans, consisting of generally non-brokered purchases of limited partnership interests in lower
 middle-market credit-oriented funds and secondary loans. This complementary strategy may result in portfolio construction and diversification benefits.

The Company s investments are subject to a number of risks. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
 ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.

Characteristics of and Risks Related to Investments in Private Companies:

Investments in private businesses involve a high degree of business and financial risk, which can result in substantial losses for the Stockholders in those investments and accordingly should be
 considered speculative. There is generally no publicly available information about the companies in which the Company invests, and the Company relies significantly on the diligence of its service providers and agents to obtain
 information in connection with investment decisions. If the Company is unable to identify all material information about these companies, among other factors, the Company may fail to receive the expected return on investment or lose
 some or all of the money invested in these companies. In addition, these businesses may have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines, smaller market shares and less experienced management than their larger competitors and
 may be more vulnerable to customer preferences, market conditions, and loss of key personnel, or economic downturns, which may adversely affect the return on, or the recovery of, investments in such businesses.

The Company generally invests in limited partnership interests of funds focused on making investments in SMBs and in long-term loans to and private equity investments in small and medium-sized private
 companies that do not have an established trading market. The Company typically exits its debt and equity investments through structured terms and amortization or when the portfolio company has a liquidity event such as a sale,
 recapitalization, or initial public offering of the company. The illiquidity of the Company s investments may adversely affect the Company s ability to dispose of debt and equity securities at times when it may be otherwise
 advantageous for the Company to liquidate such investments. In addition, if the Company were forced to immediately liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio, the proceeds of such liquidation could be significantly less
 than the current value of such investments.

Table of Contents 

Operating and Regulatory Structure:

The Company s investment activities are managed by the Advisor and supervised by the Board, a majority of whom are independent. Under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company
 pays the Advisor a quarterly management fee based on the Company s average gross assets (excluding cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) as of the end of each of the two most recently completed
 calendar quarters as well as incentive fees based on the Company s performance.

The Company has entered into an Administration Agreement with the Advisor to serve as Administrator for the Company. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Advisor provides the Company with
 services such as accounting, financial reporting, legal and compliance support and investor relations support, necessary for the Company to operate or engage a third-party firm to perform some or all of these functions. The
 Administrator has entered into a sub-administration agreement with SS C Technologies, Inc. (the "Sub-Administrator"), under which the Sub-Administrator provides various accounting and administrative services to the Company.

Revenues:

The Company generates revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the Portfolio Investments the Company holds. In addition, the Company generates income from various loan origination and
 other fees and dividends on direct equity investments. The debt the Company invests in will typically not be rated by any rating agency, but if it were, it is likely that such debt would be rated below investment grade.

Expenses:

Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator is authorized to incur and pay, in the name and on behalf of the Company, all expenses which it deems necessary or advisable.

The Advisor is responsible for and will pay, or cause to be paid, all Overhead Expenses, except to the extent provided below. For this purpose, Overhead Expenses include overhead expenses of an
 ordinarily recurring nature such as rent, utilities, supplies, secretarial expenses, stationery, charges for furniture, fixtures and equipment, employee benefits including insurance, payroll taxes and compensation of all employees.

The Company reimburses the Advisor or its affiliates, as applicable, for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with administering the Company s business including out of pocket expenses
 (including travel, lodging and meals), the Company s allocable portion of the Advisor s or any affiliated Administrator s overhead expenses in performing its obligations under the Advisory Agreement or any Administration Agreement, as
 applicable, including rent and the allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Advisor or its affiliates, as applicable, to the Company s Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs (based on
 the percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the business affairs of the Company), third- party software licensing, implementation, data management and recovery services and custom development costs.

All other expenses are borne by the Company, including legal, accounting, tax, auditing, consulting and other professional expenses (including, without limitation, expenses relating to establishing
 reputation and public relations in connection with self-sourced lending or other financial transactions); the Management Fee and Incentive Compensation; professional liability insurance (including costs relating to directors and
 officers liability insurance and errors and omissions insurance); research and market data expenses; interest on indebtedness; custodial fees; bank service fees; investment-related fees and expenses (such as third-party sourcing
 fees, fees and expenses of legal and other professionals, due diligence expenses and travel, lodging and meal expenses) related to the analysis, purchase or sale of investments, whether or not the investments are consummated; expenses
 related to special purpose vehicles (each, an SPV (including, without limitation, Overhead Expenses related thereto); interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance the Company s investments; other expenses related to the
 purchase, monitoring, sale, settlement, custody or transmittal of Company assets (directly or through trading affiliates) as will be determined by the Advisor or an affiliate thereof, as applicable, in its sole discretion (including
 costs associated with systems and software used in connection with investment-related activities); costs of reporting to Stockholders and Stockholder meetings; administration fees and expenses charged by any third-party provider of
 administration services; entity-level taxes; expenses relating to the offer, transfer, sale and marketing of shares; filing fees and expenses; Federal and state registration fees and expenses; regulatory and compliance fees and
 expenses of the Company (including with respect to any registration activities of the Company); costs of winding up and liquidating the Company; costs associated with ensuring compliance with the applicable BDC and RIC requirements,
 including, but not limited to, costs incurred in connection with the organization of, and transfer of assets to, a private investment vehicle; expenses incurred in connection with a Stockholder that defaults in respect of a Capital
 Commitment; and other expenses associated with the operation of the Company and its investment activities, including extraordinary expenses such as litigation, workout and restructuring and indemnification expenses, if any. For the
 avoidance of doubt, the Company will also bear its allocable share (based on invested capital) of any of the expenses listed above incurred by any Subsidiary Investment Vehicle.

43 

Table of Contents 

The Company is also responsible for the costs of the offering of common shares and other securities, including, but not limited to, all expenses incurred in connection with an IPO; costs and expenses
 relating to distributions paid to Stockholders; costs of effecting sales and repurchases of the Company s securities; allocated costs incurred by the Advisor or its affiliate in providing managerial assistance to those companies in
 which the Company has invested who request it; transfer agent fees; fees and expenses paid to the Company s independent directors (including expenses and costs related to meetings of the independent directors); costs of preparing and
 filing reports with the SEC and other Company reporting and compliance costs, including registration and listing fees; the Company s allocable portion of the fidelity bond; the costs of reports, proxy statements or other notices to
 Stockholders, including printing and mailing costs; the costs of any Stockholders meetings and communications; expenses payable under any underwriting agreement, including associated fees, expenses and any indemnification
 obligations; and all other expenses incurred by the Company in connection with maintaining its status as a BDC. In addition, the Company may make investments in investment funds focused primarily on investing in SMBs. As a result, the
 Company (and the Stockholders, indirectly through the Company) bear the Company s proportionate share of the fees and expenses paid by the shareholders of such investment fund.

Generally, expenses incurred directly in connection with a particular investment (or proposed investment) of the Company and other Star Mountain accounts in which Star Mountain conducts substantial
 investment and other activities in their own accounts and the accounts of other clients (the Star Mountain Accounts will be allocated among the Company and other Star Mountain Accounts pro rata based upon capital invested (or
 proposed to be invested) in such investment; provided that expenses specifically attributable to the Company or any other Star Mountain Account may be allocated to the Company or any such other Star Mountain Account, as applicable.
 The Advisor will allocate other expenses among the Company and other Star Mountain Accounts in a fair and equitable manner taking into account such factors as it deems appropriate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in light of the Company s investment mandate, which may include investments in small loans, niche credits and other similar securities, it may not be practical to
 specifically allocate certain investment-related expenses to the particular loans to which they relate. The Advisor, in its absolute and sole discretion, may instead allocate such expenses (along with expenses that relate to
 transactions that are not consummated) pro rata across one or more investments.

Advisor Expenses:

The Advisor shall pay (a) the respective compensation and expenses of the officers and employees of the Advisor, including salaries and benefits of the officers and employees of the Advisor, except as
 otherwise specified (b) expenses associated with office space and facilities, utilities and telephone services, news, quotation and similar information and pricing services, computer equipment, travel expenses and support of the
 Advisor incurred in connection with Company operations and (c) organizational expenses in excess of 1,000,000.

Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement:

The Investment Advisory Agreement was initially approved by the Board at a meeting of the Board called, in part, for such purpose, on February 24, 2021. On June 14, 2023, the Company and the Advisor
 entered into an Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement pursuant to which the Management Fee (as defined in the Investment Advisory Agreement) was reduced from 1.75 to 1.25 per annum of the average of the Company s total
 gross assets (excluding cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts). The Income Incentive Fee (as defined in the Investment Advisory Agreement) was reduced from 20.0 to 17.5 of the Company s
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in the Investment Advisory Agreement). The Capital Gains Incentive Fee (as defined in the Investment Advisory Agreement) was reduced from 20.0 to 17.5 of cumulative realized
 capital gains. The Advisor indicated to the Board of Directors of the Company that this change was proposed to better position the Company to capitalize on the current market dynamics which it believes are compelling for its market
 strategy, and that there would be no reduction in services provided to the Company in connection with the fee reduction. No other material changes were made to the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Board, including a majority of the
 directors that are not interested persons as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, most recently approved the renewal of the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement on November 13, 2024.

Such approvals were made in accordance with, and on the basis of an evaluation satisfactory to the Board as required by, Section 15(c) of the 1940 Act and applicable rules and regulations thereunder,
 including a consideration of, among other factors, (i) the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided under the agreement, (ii) the investment performance of the personnel who manage investment
 portfolios with objectives similar to the Company s, (iii) comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives and (iv) information about the services to be
 performed and the personnel performing such services under the agreement.

Net Gain (Loss):

We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or
 losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments within net change in unrealized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Portfolio Asset Quality:

The Advisor employs an investment risk rating to assign each investment an investment grade no less than quarterly. The system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio
 investment relative to the Company s initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances, the portfolio company s cash flow
 generation relative to underwriting expectations, recent business performance trends, collateral coverage and other relevant factors. When necessary, the Advisor will update its investment risk ratings, borrowing base criteria and
 covenant compliance reports. The investment risk rating of a particular investment should not, however, be deemed to be a guarantee of the investment s future performance.

Investment Performance 

 Risk Rating

Summary Description

Grade 1

Investment is performing above expectations. Full return of principal, interest and dividend income is expected.

Grade 2

Investment is performing in-line with expectations. Risk factors remain neutral or favorable compared with initial underwriting. All investments are given a 2 at the time of origination

Grade 3

Investment is performing below expectations. Capital impairment or payment delinquency is not anticipated. The investment may also be out of compliance with certain financial covenants.

Grade 4

Investment is performing below expectations. Quantitative or qualitative risks have increased materially. Delinquency of interest and / or dividend payments is anticipated. No loss of principal
 anticipated.

Grade 5

Investment is performing substantially below expectations. It is anticipated that the Company will not recoup its initial cost basis and may realize a loss upon exit. Most or all of the debt
 covenants are out of compliance. Amortization, interest and / or dividend payments are substantially delinquent.

In the event of credit deterioration, the Advisor may form a team or engage outside advisors to preserve the value of the Company s investment, including requirement of additional equitization from the
 ownership group or exercising other creditor rights.

46 

Table of Contents 

For investments rated Grade 4 or Grade 5, the Advisor enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company and will develop an action plan to address the underperformance. The
 Advisor s senior investment team has extensive experience managing investments through workouts, restructurings, and bankruptcies.

Income Taxes, Including Excise Tax:

The Company has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The Company has also elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and intends to qualify annually as a RIC. As long
 as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its Stockholders. Rather, any tax
 liability related to income earned by the Company represents obligations of the Company s Stockholders and will not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

To qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, the Company must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for RIC tax
 treatment, the Company must distribute to its Stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90.0 of its investment company taxable income for that year, which is generally its ordinary income plus the excess of its realized net
 short-term capital gains over its realized net long-term capital losses. In order for the Company not to be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, it must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98.0 of its net
 ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2 of its capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (iii) any net
 ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and
 pay a 4.0 nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on this income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not record a net expense on the Consolidated Statements of
 Operations for U.S. federal excise tax.

The Company accounts for income taxes in conformity with ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes ASC Topic 740 ). ASC Topic 740 provides guidelines for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,
 measured, presented and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC Topic 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are
 more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense in the current year. It is the Company s
 policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company did not record any uncertain income tax positions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended
 December 31, 2023 on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations:

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was 4,673,482 and 7,050,000 , respectively. Based on the weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s per share net increase (decrease) in
 net assets resulting from operations was 0 .55 and 0 .87 , respectively.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was 4,922,189 and 16,323,205,
 Based on the weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company s per share net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was 0 .65 and 2.26, respectively.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources:

The Company will generate cash primarily from the net proceeds generated from private offerings, and from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from investments and principal repayments,
 proceeds from sales of investments and borrowings under the Company s Secured Credit Facility. The Company s primary use of funds will be direct credit and equity investments in SMBs, payments of expenses and distributions to holders
 of the Company s Common Stock and, to a lesser extent, the Company may invest in limited partnership interests of funds focused on making investments in SMBs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had
 approximately 6.0 million and 5.0 million, respectively, in cash on deposit with financial institutions and 129.5 million and 176.5 million,
 respectively, in debt outstanding.

49 

Table of Contents 

In accordance with the 1940 Act, the Company generally is required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings and other senior securities, which include all borrowings and any
 preferred stock that may be issued in the future, of at least 150 . If this ratio declines below 150 , the Company cannot incur additional debt and could be required to sell a portion of the Company s investments to repay some debt
 when it is disadvantageous to do so.

Capital Contributions:

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into subscription agreements (collectively, the Subscription Agreements with new

Distributions:

The Board will determine the timing and amount, if any, of the Company s distributions. The Company intends to pay distributions on a quarterly basis. In order to avoid corporate-level tax on the
 distributed income as a RIC, the Company must distribute to Stockholders at least 90.0 of ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, on an annual basis out of
 the assets legally available for such distributions. In order for the Company to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, the Company currently intends to distribute, or be deemed to distribute, during each calendar year an amount
 at least equal to the sum of (1) 98.0 of the Company s ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of the Company s capital gain in excess of capital loss for the one-year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year and
 (3) any ordinary income and net capital gain for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.

50 

Table of Contents 

The Company has adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan DRP for Stockholders. When a distribution is declared, Stockholders cash distributions will automatically be reinvested in additional
 shares of Common Stock unless a Stockholder specifically opts out of the Company s DRP. Stockholders may opt out of the Company s DRP by providing notice twenty (20) business days in advance of the distribution payment date.

If a Stockholder opts out, that Stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of Common Stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
 results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources of the Company.

Critical Accounting Policies:

This discussion of the Company s operating plans is based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
 the U.S., or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements will require the Advisor to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the
 economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, the Company s critical accounting policies, including
 revenue recognition and taxes, have been described in Item 1. Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

Valuation of Portfolio Investments:

Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, the Company utilizes a number of factors to determine if the
 quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued quarterly at fair
 value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on, among other considerations, the input of the Advisor, the Company s Audit Committee and an independent third-party valuation firm, engaged at the direction of the Board.

The Board oversees a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:

the quarterly valuation process commences with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated by the investment professionals of the Advisor responsible for the monitoring of the portfolio investment;

the Advisor s Valuation Committee reviews the valuations provided by the independent third-party valuation firm and develops a valuation recommendation. Valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee of the
 Board;

the Audit Committee of the Board reviews valuation recommendations of the Advisor incorporating any adjustments or further supplements by the Advisor to the valuations; and

the Board discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith, based on the input of the Advisor, the independent valuation firm, and the Audit Committee.

The Company applies Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC Topic 820 ), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair
 value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC Topic 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly
 transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent,
 knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, the Company considers its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC Topic 820 specifies a fair value
 hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value.

The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized below.

Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets/exchanges for identical investments as of the reporting date.

Level 2 - Pricing inputs are observable inputs including, but not limited to, prices quoted for similar assets or liabilities in active markets/exchanges or prices quoted for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
 markets that are not active, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies.

53 

Table of Contents 

Level 3 - Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include activities where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into determination of fair value require significant
 management judgment and estimation.

The use of these valuation models requires significant estimation and judgment by the Advisor. The Advisor uses a third-party valuation firm to ensure fair values are determined on an independent basis.
 While the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate, other market participants may value identical assets differently than the Company at the measurement date. The methods used by the Company may produce a fair value
 calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. The Company may also have risk associated with its concentration of investments in certain geographic regions and industries.

To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Those estimated values do not
 necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair
 value is greatest for securities categorized in Level 3.

The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgment by the Company. The Company considers observable data to be market data, which is readily available, regularly
 distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, which may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair
 value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The categorization of an investment within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency
 of the investment and observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many investments. This condition could cause the investment to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy.

The Board, with the assistance of the Advisor, the Company s Audit Committee, and independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of the Board, will determine the fair value of the
 Company s assets, including such assets that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, on at least a quarterly basis, in accordance with the terms of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and
 Disclosures. The Audit Committee is comprised of the Independent Directors.

Item 3. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. The Company invests primarily in illiquid debt securities of private companies. Most of the Company s investments
 do not have a readily available market price, and the Company values these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on, among other considerations, the input of the Advisor, the Company s Audit
 Committee and an independent third-party valuation firm, engaged at the direction of the Board in accordance with the Company s valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result,
 determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each Portfolio Investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments the Company makes.

The majority of the loans in the Company s portfolio have floating interest rates, and we expect that the Company s loans in the future may also have floating interest rates. These loans are usually
 based on a floating benchmark rate (e.g., 3-month SOFR) plus a spread and typically have interest rate re-set provisions that adjust applicable interest rates under such loans to current market rates on a monthly or quarterly basis.
 The majority of the loans in the Company s current portfolio have interest rate floors which will effectively convert the loans to fixed rate loans for certain periods of time during which the floating rate benchmark is less than such
 interest rate floor.

All of the Company s relevant credit agreements have transitioned to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as of December 31, 2023.

A reduction in the interest rates on new investments relative to interest rates on current investments could also have an adverse impact on the Company s net interest income. An increase in interest
 rates could decrease the value of any investments the Company holds which earn fixed interest rates, including subordinated loans, senior and junior secured and unsecured debt securities and loans and high yield bonds, and also could
 increase the Company s interest expense, thereby decreasing its net income. Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make investment in the Company less attractive if the Company is not able to increase its
 dividend or distribution rate, which could reduce the value of an investment in the Company.

Investors should also be aware that a change in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to a change in the interest rate the Company may receive on many of its debt investments.
 Accordingly, a change in the interest rate could make it easier for the Company to meet or exceed the performance threshold and may result in a substantial increase in the amount of incentive fees payable to the Advisor with respect
 to the portion of the incentive fee based on income.

Assuming that the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, was to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter the Company s existing interest rate
 sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates:

Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of the Company s existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and
 composition of the assets in the Company s portfolio and other business developments, including borrowing under the credit facility or other borrowings that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net
 income. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above.
