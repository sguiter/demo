 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's only significant measurements of assets or liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition were certain long-lived assets. 
 Long-lived assets 
 The Company reviews the carrying amounts of long-lived assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company assesses performance quarterly against historical patterns, projections of future profitability, and whether it is more likely than not that the assets will be disposed of significantly prior to the end of their estimated useful life for evidence of possible impairment. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset (disposal) group is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The Company estimates the fair values of assets subject to long-lived asset impairment based on the Company's own judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets and observable market data, when available.

 million and certain long-lived assets, including intangible assets, were written down to their estimated fair value of million, resulting in asset impairment charges of million in the second quarter of 2023.

See Note 2 for further information on the Company's discontinued operations.

The Company recognized a million gain on the sale in the third quarter of 2024. As a result of this sale, the Company had no assets held for sale as of September 30, 2024. The Company remains obligated under the terms of the leases for the rent and other costs that may be associated with the lease of the Munhall facility through 2036. 
 Other assets, net Assets held for sale 
 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and the Company's note payable approximated their carrying value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company's revolving line of credit and long-term debt, which is based on a variable interest rate, are also reflected in the financial statements at carrying value which approximate fair values as of September 30, 2024. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents are considered Level 1 measurements. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable, note payable, revolving line of credit and long-term debt are considered Level 2 measurements.

 During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company entered into a Limited Consent, Second Amendment to Credit Agreement and Omnibus Amendment to Loan Documents with BMO Bank N.A. and the other lenders under the Company s credit facility (the Credit Facility Amendment ). The Credit Facility Amendment contains a consent for the SPT divestiture, released the lien on the assets of SPT and removed SPT as a loan party. The Credit Facility Amendment also reduced the maximum revolving loan commitment under the credit facility from million to million, and increased the interest rate for the credit facility from SOFR plus an interest rate margin of between and to SOFR plus an interest rate margin of between and , depending on average availability under the credit facility and the Company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. As required by the Credit Facility Amendment, the Company used the proceeds from the SPT divestiture to prepay in full the term loan in the original principal amount of million under the credit facility and used the remaining proceeds to prepay in part the revolving loans under the credit facility. 
 
 The borrowing capacity under the credit facility totals million consisting of a million revolving line of credit which includes a million machinery and equipment sub-limit. The Company had debt outstanding under its credit facilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit currently bear interest at (a) the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus , or (b) SOFR plus . The Credit Agreement also provides an unused commitment fee based on the daily used portion of the credit facility.

 Executive Overview 
 Ascent Industries Co. is a diverse industrials company focused on the production of specialty chemicals and industrial tubular products. Ascent Industries Co. was incorporated in 1958 as the successor to a chemical manufacturing business founded in 1945 known as Blackman Uhler Industries Inc. 
 The Company's business is divided into two reportable operating segments, Specialty Chemicals and Tubular Products. The Specialty Chemicals segment produces specialty products for the pulp and paper, coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers (CASE), textile, automotive, household, industrial and institutional ("HII"), agricultural, water and waste-water treatment, construction, oil and gas and other industries. The Tubular Products segment serves markets through pipe and tube production and customers in the appliance, architectural, automotive and commercial transportation, brewery, chemical, petrochemical, pulp and paper, mining, power generation (including nuclear), water and waste-water treatment, liquid natural gas ("LNG"), food processing, pharmaceutical, oil and gas and other industries. 
 Munhall Closure 
 During the second quarter of 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company made the decision to permanently cease operations at Munhall effective on or around August 31, 2023. This strategic decision is part of the Company s ongoing efforts to consolidate manufacturing to drive an increased focus on its core operations and to improve profitability while driving operational efficiencies. Munhall results are included within discontinued operations in all periods presented. 
 Divestiture of Specialty Pipe Tube, Inc. 
 On December 22, 2023, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Specialty Pipe Tube, Inc. SPT entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which Ascent and SPT sold substantially all of the assets primarily related to SPT to Specialty Pipe Tube Operations, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The consideration for the transaction was approximately 55 million of cash proceeds subject to certain closing adjustments. The transaction closed on December 22, 2023. As result of the sale, SPT results of operations are classified under discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior to the divestiture, SPT was reported under the Company's Tubular Products segment. The discussion and analysis of our results of operations refers to continuing operations unless noted. 
 Macroeconomic Events 
 Macroeconomic and inflationary pressures have negatively impacted our revenue, operating margins and net income in 2023 and 2024 to date, including increased pricing pressures within both segments of our business. During the quarter, we continued to see demand fluctuations in our end user markets resulting in decreases in volume year over year and sequentially from the second quarter, however, we continue to focus on stabilization initiatives centered around pricing and product mix optimization, strategic sourcing, labor and overhead improvements and working capital which has allowed us to achieve three consecutive quarters of positive margin expansion and setting the foundation for future growth. The ongoing factors driving volatility in global markets that could impact our business' earnings and cash flows include, but are not limited to, the misalignment of supply and demand for labor, energy, raw materials and other inputs, the inflation of (or unavailability of) raw material inputs and transportation and logistics services, currency fluctuations, interest rates and extreme weather, the purchasing of commodities and relative commodity prices. The Company continues efforts to offset these inflationary pressures and continues to implement initiatives to improve working capital and evaluate other opportunities to maintain and improve financial performance in the short and long term, however, if these inflationary and demand pressures continue, our revenue, gross and operating margins and net income (loss) will continue to be impacted for the remainder of 2024.

 The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 1,612.2 and 124.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0 primarily due to discrete tax charges associated with the recording of a valuation allowance on cumulative U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. During the period, the Company determined it was more likely than not that the existing cumulative deferred tax assets would be unrealizable and recorded a discrete tax charge of 6.2 million. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful because they are key measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions as well as allow readers to compare the financial results between periods. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider the Company's performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results or financial condition as reported under GAAP. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define "EBITDA" as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define "Adjusted EBITDA" as EBITDA further adjusted for the impact of non-cash and other items we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing performance. These items include: goodwill impairment, asset impairment, gain on lease modification, stock-based compensation, non-cash lease cost, acquisition costs and other fees, shelf registration costs, loss on extinguishment of debt,

 retention costs and restructuring and severance costs from net income. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because not all companies calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these non-GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including level of investment required to support our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, credit facilities and working capital management. Capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy which we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment. We have a disciplined approach to capital allocation focusing on priorities that support our business and growth. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Funds generated by operating activities supplemented by our available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities are our most significant sources of liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, we held 8.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, as well as 57.5 million of remaining available capacity on our revolving line of credit. We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures as well as repay our debt obligations as they become due over the next 12 months and beyond. 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Cash flows from continuing operations were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 7,445 4,002 Investing activities (1,281) (2,411) Financing activities (678) (19,433) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 5,486 (17,842) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven changes in working capital partially offset by decreases in net losses year over year. Changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of inventory production and purchases, customer payments of accounts receivable and payments to vendors in the regular course of business. Inventory increased operating cash flows for the first nine months of 2024 by 8.0 million compared to an increase of 5.9 million for the first nine months of 2023, while accounts payable decreased operating cash flows by 4.2 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to an 8.9 million increase in the first nine months of

Table of Contents 

 2023. The changes in inventory and accounts payable is primarily driven by lower inventory purchases to match inventory levels with sales, partially offset by higher inventory turns year-over-year and decreases in days payables outstanding on a nine-month average basis. Accounts receivable decreased operating cash flows by 1.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to a 3.8 million increase in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in cash generated by accounts receivable is primarily driven by a decrease in sales partially offset by a decrease in days sales outstanding compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities primarily consists of transactions related to capital expenditures. The decrease in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by decreases in capital expenditures in the current year compared to the prior year. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities primarily consists of transactions related to our long-term debt. The decrease in cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by decreased total borrowings and repayments under the Company's credit facility compared to the prior year. 
 Short-term Debt 
 The Company has a note payable in the amount of 0.9 million with an annual interest rate of 3.70 maturing April 1, 2025, associated with the financing of the Company's insurance premium in 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance was 0.6 million. 
 Long-term Debt 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company entered into a Limited Consent, Second Amendment to Credit Agreement and Omnibus Amendment to Loan Documents with BMO Bank N.A. and the other lenders under the Company s credit facility (the Credit Facility Amendment ). The Credit Facility Amendment contains a consent for the SPT divestiture, released the lien on the assets of SPT and removed SPT as a loan party. The Credit Facility Amendment also reduced the maximum revolving loan commitment under the credit facility from 105 million to 80 million, and increased the interest rate for the credit facility from SOFR plus an interest rate margin of between 1.60 and 1.70 to SOFR plus an interest rate margin of between 1.85 and 2.10 , depending on average availability under the credit facility and the Company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. The Company had no debt outstanding under its credit facilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The Credit Agreement contains covenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio if excess availability falls below the greater of (i) 7.5 million and (ii) 10 of the revolving credit facility (currently 8.0 million). As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial debt covenants. See Note 8 in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Company's line of credit. 
 Share Repurchases and Dividends 
 We have a share repurchase program, authorized by the Company's Board of Directors, that is executed through purchases made from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market or privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. Shares repurchased are returned to status of authorized, but unissued shares of common stock or held in treasury. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 462,685 shares of its share repurchase authorization remaining.

Table of Contents 

 Shares repurchased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Number of shares repurchased 42,623 44,799 74,186 95,955 Average price per share 9.79 8.87 9.92 9.38 Total cost of shares repurchased 418,563 398,861 738,361 903,012 
 
 At the end of each fiscal year the Board of Directors reviews the financial performance and capital needed to support future growth to determine the amount of cash dividend, if any, which is appropriate. In 2023, no dividends were declared or paid by the Company. 
 
 Other Financial Measures 
 Below are additional financial measures that we believe are important in understanding the Company's liquidity position from year to year. The metrics are defined as: 
 
 Liquidity Measure: 
 Current ratio = current assets divided by current liabilities. The current ratio will be determined by the Company using generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied. 
 Leverage Measure: 
 Debt to capital = total debt divided by total capital. The debt to capital ratio will be determined by the Company using generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied. 
 Profitability Ratio: 
 Return on average equity ("ROAE") = net income divided by the trailing 12-month average of equity. The ROAE will be determined by the Company using generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied. 
 
 Results of these additional measures are as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Current ratio 3.8 3.7 Debt to capital Return on average equity (14.4) (38.6) 
 
 Material Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, our material cash requirements for our known contractual and other obligations were as follows: 
 Operating and Finance Leases - The Company enters into various lease agreements for the real estate and manufacturing equipment used in the normal course of business. Operating and finance lease obligations were 33.3 million, with 1.7 million payable within 12 months. See Note 9 for further detail of our lease obligations and the timing of expected future payments.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act; therefore, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act as controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, because of the previously reported material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, as described below. 
 Previously Reported Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15f-15(f). As reported in our 2023 Form 10-K, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 as a result of material weaknesses in the control environment and control activities areas. A material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Refer to our 2023 Form 10-K for a description of our material weaknesses. 
 Ongoing Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weaknesses 
 Our material weaknesses were not remediated at September 30, 2024. Our Board of Directors and management are committed to the continued implementation of remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses. The Company has a remediation plan which includes designing and implementing review and approval controls over the data utilized in various accounting processes, controls that will address the accuracy, timely recording and completeness of data used in the determination of significant accounting estimates, reserves and valuations in accordance with U.S. GAAP, controls that will address the sufficient review of complex accounting areas and controls that will address the monitoring of general information technology areas including user access, cyber security and segregation of duties. 
 The following steps are among the measures being taken by the Company with a number of these initiatives directly related to strengthening our controls and addressing specific control deficiencies which contributed to the material weaknesses. The steps to remediate the deficiencies underlying the material weaknesses include: 
 Engaging an outside service provider to assist management with the remediation efforts including to help review and make recommendations with respect to the redesign and implementation of our internal controls over general information technology controls, including user access provisioning, cyber-security and segregation of duties 
 Enhancing/designing/implementing controls over the inventory, revenue recognition and accounts receivable, period-end financial reporting, account analyses, and journal entry processes 
 Enhancing/designing/implementing controls over accounting for income taxes 
 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is monitoring management's ongoing remediation efforts. With the Audit Committee's oversight, management has dedicated significant resources and efforts to improve our internal control environment to remedy the identified material weaknesses. As we continue to evaluate and implement improvements to our internal control over financial reporting, our management may decide to take additional measures to address our control deficiencies or to modify the remediation efforts undertaken. Because the reliability of the internal control process requires repeatable execution, our material weaknesses cannot be considered fully remediated until all remedial processes and procedures (including additional remediation efforts identified by our senior management as necessary) have been

 implemented, each applicable control has operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. Until all identified material weaknesses are remediated, we will not be able to assert that our internal controls are effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the ongoing remediation efforts described above, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 It is not unusual for us and our subsidiaries to be involved in various unresolved legal actions, administrative proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business involving, among other things, product liability, commercial, employment, workers' compensation, and environmental matters..

At the termination of any such Temporary Taking, Lessee will, at its own cost and expense and pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.02, promptly commence and complete restoration of such Property. Section 11.05. Adjustment of Losses. Any loss under any property damage insurance required to be maintained by Lessee shall be adjusted by Lessor and Lessee. Any Net Award relating to a Total Condemnation or a Partial Condemnation shall be adjusted by Lessor or, at Lessor s election, Lessee. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provisions of this Section 11.05 to the contrary, if at the time of any Condemnation or any Casualty or at any time thereafter an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessor is hereby authorized and empowered but shall not be obligated, in the name and on behalf of Lessee and otherwise, to file and prosecute Lessee s claim, if any, for a Net Award on account of such Condemnation or such Casualty and to collect such Net Award and apply the same to the curing of such Event of Default and any other then existing Event of Default under this Lease and/or to

If such failure cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period, as determined by Lessor in its reasonable discretion, and Lessee is diligently pursuing a cure of such failure, then Lessee shall have a reasonable period to cure such failure beyond such thirty (30)-day period, which shall in no event exceed ninety (90) days after receiving notice of such failure from Lessor.

Section 12.02. Remedies. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, with or without notice or demand, except as otherwise expressly provided herein or such other notice as may be required by statute and cannot be waived by Lessee, Lessor shall be entitled to exercise, at its option, concurrently, successively, or in any combination, all remedies available at Law or in equity, including, without limitation, any one or more of the following: (a) to terminate this Lease, whereupon Lessee s right to possession of the Properties shall cease and this Lease, except as to Lessee s liability, shall be terminated; (b) to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, to (i) re-enter and take possession of the Properties (or any part thereof), any or all personal property or fixtures of Lessee upon the Properties and, to the extent permissible, permits and other rights or privileges of Lessee pertaining to the use and operation of the Properties, and (ii) expel

If Lessee shall, after default, voluntarily give up possession of the Properties to Lessor, deliver to Lessor or its agents the keys to the Properties, or both, such actions shall be deemed to be in compliance with Lessor s rights and the acceptance thereof by Lessor or its agents shall not be deemed to constitute a termination of the Lease.

Except to the extent required by applicable Law, Lessor shall have no obligation to relet the Properties or any part thereof and shall in no event be liable for refusal or failure to relet the Properties or any part thereof, or, in the event of any such reletting, for refusal or failure to collect any rent due upon such reletting, and no such refusal or failure shall operate to relieve Lessee of any liability under this Lease or otherwise to affect any such liability.

Every power and remedy given by this Section or by Law to Lessor may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by Lessor, subject at all times to Lessor s right in its sole judgment to discontinue any work commenced by Lessor or change any course of action undertaken by Lessor.
