in the State of Delaware under the name Cellular Transplants, Inc. The original Certificate of
Incorporation was restated on February 14, 1992 to change the name of the Company to Cyto Therapeutics, Inc. On May 24, 2000, the Certificate
of Incorporation as restated was further amended to change the name of the Company to StemCells, Inc. 

On
November 28, 2016, the Company consummated a transaction pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 15, 2016, with Microbot
Medical Ltd., a private medical device company organized under the laws of the State of Israel Microbot Israel ). On the
same day and in connection with the Merger, the Company changed its name from StemCells, Inc. to Microbot Medical Inc. On November 29,
2016, the Company s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol MBOT . 

The
Company and its subsidiary are sometimes collectively referred to as the Company as the context may require. 

B.
Risk Factors 

Going
Concern 

To
date, the Company has not generated revenues from its operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash equivalents and a marketable
securities balance of approximately , excluding restricted cash. Due to continuing research and development activities, the Company
expects to continue to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future, as well as to seek to raise additional funds through future
issuances of either debt and/or equity securities and possibly additional grants from government institutions. The Company will require
additional capital and its ability to raise additional capital in the equity and debt markets is dependent on a number of factors, including,
but not limited to, the market demand for the Company s stock, which itself is subject to a number of development and business
risks and uncertainties, as well as the uncertainty that the Company would be able to raise such additional capital at a price or on
terms that are favorable to the Company. 

Accordingly,
these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

War
in Israel 

On
October 7, 2023, the State of Israel, where the Company s operations are primarily based, suffered a surprise attack by hostile
forces from Gaza, which led to ongoing military operations and armed conflicts in the Gaza Strip. It continues to evolve and has since
spread to northern Israel and threatens to spread to other Middle Eastern countries including Lebanon and Iran. These military operations
and related activities are on-going as of the issuance date of these financial statements. 

The
Company has considered various ongoing risks relating to the military operation and related matters, including: 

That some of the Company s Israeli subcontractors, vendors, suppliers and other companies in which the Company relies, are
currently only partially active, as instructed by the relevant authorities; 

A slowdown in the number of international flights in and out of Israel; and 

Reduced workforce due to military service of some employees 

The
Company is closely monitoring how the military operation and related activities could adversely affect its anticipated milestones and
its Israel-based activities to support future clinical and regulatory milestones, including the Company s ability to import materials
that are required to construct the Company s devices and to ship them outside of Israel. As of the filing date of the Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q of which these financial statements are a part, the Company has determined that there have not been any materially
adverse effects on its business or operations, but it continues to monitor the situation, as any future escalation or change could result
in a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company s Israeli office to support the Company s clinical and regulatory
activities. The Company does not have any specific contingency plans in the event of any such escalation or change. 

C.
Unaudited Interim Condensed Financial Statements

accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim
condensed financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC regulations. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In

and returned the licensed intellectual property for the SCS (ViRob) back to TRDF in July 2023. As a result, as of the date of these financial
statements, the License Agreement is limited to the certain technology relating to the Company s LIBERTY Endovascular
Robotic Surgical System. 

C.

On
January 4, 2018, Microbot Israel entered into an agreement with CardioSert (the CardioSert Agreement to acquire certain

and maintaining, the Technology, which resulted in CardioSert triggering on March 3, 2024 its right to reacquire the Technology for nominal

Agreement. As a result, Microbot Israel s liability to repay CardioSert s IIA grants in the aggregate amount of approximately

E.

F.
Acquisition of Nitiloop s assets: 

On
October 6, 2022, Microbot Israel purchased substantially all of the assets, including intellectual property, devices, components and
product related materials (the Assets ), of Nitiloop Ltd., an Israeli limited liability company Nitiloop ).
The Assets include intellectual property and technology in the field of intraluminal revascularization devices with anchoring mechanism
and integrated microcatheter (the Technology and the products or potential products incorporating the Technology owned
by Nitiloop and designated by Nitiloop as NovaCross , NovaCross Xtreme and NovaCross BTK and
any enhancements, modifications and improvements thereof Devices ). Microbot Israel did not assume any material liabilities
of Nitiloop other than obligations Nitiloop has to the IIA and relating to certain renewal/maintenance fees for a European patent application. 

In
consideration for the acquisition of the Assets, Microbot Israel shall pay royalties to Nitiloop, which shall not, in the aggregate,
exceed , as follows:

at a rate of of net revenue generated as a result of sales, license or other exploitation of the Devices; and 

Royalties
at a rate of of net revenue generated from the sale, license or other exploitation of commercialization of the technology as part
of an integrated product. 

Based
on the Company s analysis, the Company concluded that the acquisition of the assets does not meet the definition of a business
for the purpose of applying SEC Rules (S-X Rules of 3-05, 8-04 and 11-01). 

G.
Litigation resulting from the 2017 financing: 

The
Company was named as the defendant in a lawsuit captioned Empery Asset Master Ltd., Empery Tax Efficient, LP, Empery Tax Efficient II,
LP, Hudson Bay Master Fund Ltd., (the Plaintiffs ), against Microbot Medical Inc., Defendant, in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York (Index No. 651182/2020) (the Lawsuit ). The complaint alleged, among other things,
that the Company breached multiple representations and warranties contained in the Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA related to the Company s June 8, 2017 equity financing (the 2017 Financing ), of which the Plaintiffs participated,
and fraudulently induced Plaintiffs into signing the SPA. The complaint sought rescission of the SPA and return of the Plaintiffs 
 purchase price with respect to the 2017 Financing. 

On
January 26, 2024 (the Effective Date ), the Company entered into a settlement agreement and release with the Plaintiffs
(the Settlement Agreement ), effectively resolving the Lawsuit. 

Pursuant
to the Settlement Agreement, the Company paid consisting of a cash payment of , covered by the Company s insurance
company, and shares of restricted common stock which were subsequently registered for resale. Furthermore, the Company s
insurance company is responsible for covering legal expenses incurred by the Company in relation to the legal proceedings of the Lawsuit.
In February 2024, the Plaintiffs filed a stipulation discontinuing the Lawsuit with prejudice. 

The
Company concluded the Settlement Agreement gave rise to loss contingencies in the scope of ASC Subtopic 450-20, Contingencies 
Loss Contingencies, and as of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a contingent liability, as the Company deemed it both probable
and reasonably estimable. 

The
Company determined that the loss contingency should be recognized as non-operating losses, offset by loss recoveries received from the
Company s insurance company. 

As
a result of the Settlement Agreement and the insurance recovery received from the insurance company, as of December 31, 2023, the Company
recorded a liability and an asset on its balance sheet totaling and , respectively. Within this asset, represents
the recovery of the cash payment of the settlement amount, and represents recovery of legal expenses. A net non-operating loss of
 from legal settlement was reflected in the Company s statement of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2023.
In the first quarter of 2024, the Company received from the insurance company, subsequently closing the asset recorded as of December
31, 2023. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2024, the Company paid the settlement amount by transferring to the Plaintiffs
and issuing shares of the Company s common stock, thereby closing the liability recorded as of December 31, 2023. 

H.
Mona litigation: 

On
April 28, 2019, the Company brought an action against Alliance Investment Management, Ltd. Alliance ), later amended to
add Joseph Mona Mona as a defendant, in the Southern District of New York under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), to compel Alliance and/or Mona to disgorge short swing profits realized from purchases
and sales of the Company s securities within a period of less than six months. The amount of profits was estimated in the complaint
to be approximately . 

On
March 31, 2021, the Court entered a judgment against Mona and in favor of the Company in the amount of approximately . Collection
of the judgment was deferred pending resolution of Mona s counterclaim. 

On
August 22, 2023, the District Court dismissed the Section 10(b) counterclaim in its entirety. After the Company initiated efforts to
execute on the judgment against Mona (the Judgment ), Mona urged the Court to decide the motion to vacate the 16(b)
Judgment on the grounds that the Company purportedly lacks Constitutional standing to bring this case, which he originally filed prior
to the final dismissal of his 10(b) counterclaim. On January 30, 2024, a Report Recommendation was issued that the motion be denied,
which the Court adopted in the entirety in an Order on March 5, 2024. Mona has purported to appeal that denial. The Company believes
Mona s purported appeal is untimely and substantively meritless. Mona s appellate brief was filed on June 28, 2024 and the
Company s opposition has also been filed. The Company is waiting for the Court s determination as to whether oral arguments
will be required, which if so are expected to be held by January 2025. 

As
of May 10, 2024, Mona posted a bond in the full amount of the Judgment, which the Company will move to collect if the appeal is denied
or the original judgment in the Company s favor is upheld. 

I.
Contingent bonus commitments based on future capital raising: 

In February 2024, the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors of the Company approved certain bonuses for the 2023 fiscal year contingent on capital raising efforts. These

Overview 

Microbot
is a preclinical medical device company specializing in the research, design and development of next generation robotic endoluminal surgery
devices targeting the minimally invasive surgery space. Microbot is primarily focused on leveraging its robotic technologies with the
goal of redefining surgical robotics while improving surgical outcomes for patients. 

Using
our LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System, we are developing the first ever fully disposable robot for various
endovascular interventional procedures. 

Technological
Platforms 

LIBERTY 
Endovascular Robotic Surgical System 

On
January 13, 2020, Microbot unveiled what it believes is the world s first fully disposable robotic system for use in endovascular
interventional procedures, such as cardiovascular, peripheral and neurovascular. The LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System
features a unique compact design with the capability to be operated remotely, reduce radiation exposure and physical strain to the physician,
reduce the risk of cross contamination, as well as the potential to eliminate the use of multiple consumables when used with its NovaCross 
 platform or possibly other guidewire/microcatheter technologies. 

The
LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System is designed to maneuver guidewires and over-the-wire devices (such as microcatheters)
within the body s vasculature. It eliminates the need for extensive capital equipment requiring dedicated Cath-lab rooms as well
as dedicated staff. 

We
believe the addressable markets for the LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System are the Interventional Cardiology,
Interventional Radiology and Interventional Neuroradiology markets. 

The
unique characteristics of the LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System - compact, mobile, disposable and remotely controlled
- open the opportunity of expanding telerobotic interventions to patients with limited access to life-saving procedures, such as mechanical
thrombectomy in ischemic stroke. 

The
LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System is being designed to have the following attributes: 

Compact
 size - Eliminates the need for large capital equipment in dedicated cath-lab rooms with dedicated
 staff. 

Fully
 disposable - To our knowledge, the first fully disposable, robotic system for endovascular
 procedures. 

One
 Done - Can be made compatible with Microbot s NitiLoop s NovaCross 
 products or possibly other guidewire/microcatheter technologies, that combines guidewire
 and microcatheter into a single device. 

State
 of the art maneuverability - Provides linear and rotational control of its guidewire, as
 well as linear and rotational control of a guide catheter, and the linear motion for an additional
 over the wire device. 

Compatibility
 with a wide range of commercially-available guidewires, microcatheters and guide-catheters. 

Enhanced
 operator safety and comfort - Aims to reduce exposure to ionizing radiation and the need
 for heavy lead vests otherwise to be worn during procedures, as well as reducing the exposure
 to Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI). 

Ease
 of use - Its intuitive remote controls aims to simplify advanced procedures while shortening
 the physician s learning curve. 

Telemedicine
 compatible - Capable of supporting tele-catheterization, carried out remotely by highly trained
 specialists. 

12 

On
August 17, 2020, Microbot announced the successful conclusion of its feasibility animal study using the LIBERTY Endovascular
Robotic Surgical System. The study met all of its end points with no intraoperative adverse events, which supports Microbot s objectives
to allow physicians to conduct a catheter-based procedure from outside the catheterization laboratory (cath-lab), avoiding radiation
exposure, physical strain and the risk of cross contamination. The study was performed by two leading physicians in the neuro vascular
and peripheral vascular intervention spaces, and the results demonstrated robust navigation capabilities, intuitive usability and accurate
deployment of embolic agents, most of which was conducted remotely from the cath-lab s control room. 

On
May 3, 2023, we announced that the LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System has surpassed its 100th catheterization during multiple
preclinical studies, with a 95 success rate of reaching pre-determined vascular targets, such as distal branches of hepatic, gastric,
splenic, mesenteric, renal and hypogastric arteries. Moreover, all of the procedures were completed without notable signs of intraoperative
injury. 

On
June 29, 2023, we announced the successful completion of a two-day preclinical study held by leading key opinion leaders at a New York-based
research lab, where they performed dozens of catheterizations, including the utilization of the LIBERTY Endovascular
Robotic Surgical System s remote operation capabilities, to pre-determined vascular targets, with a 100 success rate of reaching
the intended target with no observable on-site complications. 

In
October 2023, we announced the successful initial outcomes from our pivotal preclinical study with the LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic
Surgical System. The pivotal study was conducted by three leading interventional radiologists that utilized the LIBERTY Endovascular
Robotic Surgical System to reach a total of 48 animal targets. A total of 6 LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical Systems
were used in the study. All 6 LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical Systems performed flawlessly, with 100 usability and technical
success. No acute adverse events or complications were visually observed intra-operative. In December 2023, we announced that the final
histopathology and lab report supplements our previous findings, and that the results of the study will support our Investigational Device
Exemption IDE submission to the FDA to commence human clinical study. 

On
October 24, 2023, we announced that we received confirmation for the commencement of the process to support our future CE Mark approval,
and to ultimately allow us to market the LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System in Europe as well as other regions
who accept the CE Mark. As a result, we recently were granted ISO 13485 certification for our quality management system, which is required
to obtain CE mark approval for sales in the European Union. In addition, in view of the recent revision published by the U.S. Food 
Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the QMSR (quality system management regulation) and its incorporation by reference of the ISO 13485
standard, we believe it will help streamline our transition into this revised FDA regulation. 

On
January 29, 2024, the Company submitted an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application with the FDA, in order to commence its
pivotal clinical trial in humans. On June 3, 2024, we announced that we received the FDA s approval to proceed with our pivotal
human clinical trial as part of our IDE application for our LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System. Since then,
Brigham and Women s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, Baptist Hospital of Miami, which includes Miami Cardiac Vascular Institute
and Miami Cancer Institute, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, have each enrolled in the clinical trial as part of
the IDE for the Company s LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System. Since then, in October 2024, the Company
has successfully completed enrollment and follow up for all patients in its human clinical trial. 

The Company also announced that
is has successfully completed all biocompatibility tests, as required by its Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application and received
full approval for the IDE study from the FDA. 

The
Company currently anticipates filing its 510(k) submission with the FDA by of the end of 2024, and receiving 510(k) clearance from the
FDA in the first half of 2025. Due to recent changes in the regulations that govern the production and distribution of medical devices
in Europe (EU MDR), where the Company has already achieved the first step of obtaining the ISO 13485 certification, the Company now anticipates
CE Mark approval in the second half of 2026. However, we can give no assurance that we will meet any of these projected milestones, if
ever. 

The
Company entered into an agreement with Emory University, which will allow the parties to evaluate and explore the potential for a future
collaboration in connection with autonomous robotics in endovascular procedures. Under the terms of the agreement, Emory University will
assume the responsibility of exploring the feasibility of integrating the LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System with an imaging
system to create an autonomous robotic system for endovascular procedures. 

NovaCross 

On
October 6, 2022, we purchased substantially all of the assets, including intellectual property, devices, components and product related
materials of Nitiloop Ltd., an Israeli limited liability company. The assets include intellectual property and technology in the field
of intraluminal revascularization devices with anchoring mechanism and integrated microcatheter, and the products or potential products
incorporating the technology owned by Nitiloop and designated by Nitiloop as NovaCross , NovaCross Xtreme 
and NovaCross BTK and any enhancements, modifications and improvements. This technology is also expected to be incorporated
in our One Done feature. 

War
in Israel 

On
October 7, 2023, the State of Israel, where the Company s research and development and other operations are primarily based, suffered
a surprise attack by hostile forces from Gaza, which led to ongoing military operations and armed conflicts in the Gaza Strip. It continues
to evolve and has since spread to northern Israel and threatens to spread to other Middle Eastern countries including Lebanon and Iran.
These military operations and related activities are on-going as of the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

The
Company has considered various ongoing risks relating to the military operation and related matters, including: 

That
 some of the Company s Israeli subcontractors, vendors, suppliers and other companies
 in which the Company relies, are currently only partially active, as instructed by the relevant
 authorities; 

A
 slowdown in the number of international flights in and out of Israel; and 

Reduced
 workforce due to military service of some employees. 

13 

The
Company is closely monitoring how the military operation and related activities could adversely affect its anticipated milestones and
its Israel-based activities to support future clinical and regulatory milestones, including the Company s ability to import materials
that are required to construct the Company s devices and to ship them outside of Israel. As of the filing date of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has determined that there have not been any materially adverse effects on its business or operations,
but it continues to monitor the situation, as any future escalation or change could result in a material adverse effect on the ability
of the Company s Israeli office to support the Company s clinical and regulatory activities. The Company does not have any
specific contingency plans in the event of any such escalation or change. 

Financial
Operations Overview 

Research
and Development Expenses, net 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses and overhead for Microbot s research, development and
engineering personnel, prototype materials and research studies, obtaining and maintaining Microbot s patent portfolio, net of
government grants. Microbot expenses its research and development costs as incurred. 

General
and Administrative Expenses, net 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with management salaries and benefits, professional fees for accounting,
auditing, consulting, legal services, and insurance expenses. 

Microbot
expects that its general and administrative expenses will increase over the long-term, even if a period-to-period comparison may show
a decrease, as it expands its operating activities, maintains compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements. Microbot expects
these potential increases will likely include management costs, legal fees, accounting fees, directors and officers liability
insurance premiums and expenses associated with investor relations. 

Income
Taxes 

Microbot
has incurred net losses and has not recorded any income tax benefits for the losses. It is still in its development stage and has not
yet generated revenues, therefore, it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will not be available for the tax losses
to be fully utilized in the future. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

Management s
discussion and analysis of Microbot s financial condition and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires Microbot to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Microbot bases its estimates
on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

While
Microbot s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to its consolidated financial statements,
Microbot believes the following accounting policies are the most critical for fully understanding and evaluating its consolidated financial
condition and results of operations. 

Contingencies 

Management
records and discloses legal contingencies in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 450 Contingencies .
A provision is recorded when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
The Company monitors the stage of progress of its litigation matters to determine if any adjustments are required. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
Company measures the fair value of certain of its financial instruments on a recurring basis. 

A
fair value hierarchy is used to rank the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Financial assets and
liabilities carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 

Level
1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 

Level
2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets
and liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices in the markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated
by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level
3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or
liabilities.

Research
and Development Expenses, net . The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in clinical study expenses, regulation consultations and
payroll expenses, offset by deduction of government grants and a decrease in animal study expenses. 

The
increase in research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023 was primarily due to the increases in payroll expenses due to the cease of cost reduction plan which was implemented in 2023,
an increase in clinical study expenses and increase in regulation expenses, offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expenses,
a decrease in animal study expenses and a decrease due to deduction of government grants. 

General
and Administrative Expenses, net . The increase in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024
compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in payroll expenses due to the cease of cost reduction
plan which was implemented in 2023, offset by a decrease in legal expenses. 

The
increase in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in payroll expenses due to the cease of cost reduction plan which was
implemented in 2023 as well as increase in stock based compensation expenses, offset by a decrease in travel expenses and legal
expenses. 

Financing
Income, net . The decrease in financing income, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to expenses incurred from changes in exchange rates, partially offset by an increase
in interest income. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

To
date, Microbot has not generated revenues from operations. Microbot has incurred losses since inception and negative cash flows from
operating activities for all periods presented. As of September 30, 2024, Microbot had a net working capital of approximately 3.6 million,
consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. This compares to net working capital of approximately 4.1
million as of December 31, 2023. Microbot anticipates that it will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as it continues
research and development efforts of its primary product candidate and continues to incur costs associated with being a public company. 

Microbot
has funded its operations through the issuance of capital stock, grants from the Israeli Innovation Authority, and convertible debt.
Since inception (November 2010) through September 30, 2024, Microbot has raised cash proceeds of approximately 72.8 million and incurred
a total cumulative loss of approximately 87.5 million. 

Microbot
Israel obtained from the Israeli Innovation Authority IIA grants for participation in research and development for the
years 2013 through September 30, 2024 in the total amount of approximately 1.9 million. This amount includes amounts received of approximately
 378,000, which are a portion of an additional grant from the IIA in the
amount of approximately NIS 1.6 million (approximately 447,000) approved by the IIA on June 1, 2023, to further finance the development
of the manufacturing process of the LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System. On January 4, 2018, Microbot Israel
entered into an agreement with CardioSert to acquire certain of its patent-protected technology as well as to assume CardioSert s
grants from the IIA in the aggregate amount of approximately 530,000. During the 3 rd quarter of 2024, Microbot Israel transferred
such technology back to CardioSert, for nominal consideration and, as a result, Microbot Israel s liability to repay CardioSert s
IIA grants in the aggregate amount of approximately 530,000 was also transferred back to CardioSert. On October 6, 2022, Microbot Israel
entered into an agreement with Nitiloop Ltd. to acquire substantially all of its assets. Nitiloop received grants from the IIA in the
aggregate amount of approximately 925,000 and Microbot Israel took over the liability to repay such grants. 

Microbot
Israel is obligated to pay royalties amounting to 3 -5 of its future sales up to the amount of the grants. The grants are linked to
the exchange rate of the dollar to the New Israeli Shekel and bears interest at an annual rate of SOFR, a benchmark interest rate which
replaced LIBOR. Under the terms of the grants and applicable law, Microbot is restricted from transferring any technologies, know-how,
manufacturing or manufacturing rights developed using the grant outside of Israel without the prior approval of the Israel Innovation
Authority. Microbot has no obligation to repay the grants, if the applicable project fails, is unsuccessful or aborted before any sales
are generated; accordingly, as we have discontinued the CardioSert program and are returning the technology to CardioSert, we do not
expect to repay, or have the obligation to repay, the grants relating to that technology. The financial risk is assumed completely by
the IIA. 

15 

On
March 2, 2023, the Company announced that it received approval for a grant from the Ministry of Economy in the amount of approximately
NIS 300,000, which based on an exchange rate on such date of NIS 1.00 = 0.2923, would be approximately 88,000, to further finance the
marketing activities of the LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System in the U.S. market. In relation to the Ministry of Economy
grant, the Company is obligated to pay royalties amounting to 3 of future sales of the LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System
up to the grant amount plus interest. 

During
the second fiscal quarter of 2023, Microbot commenced a core-business focus program and a cost reduction plan while it sought to raise
sufficient additional capital to continue development of the LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System. In May and
June 2023, Microbot raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 7.6 million, before fees and expenses of approximately 1.1 million,
from investors, to continue to fund its operations and research and development activities and will need additional funds to continue
the FDA approval process for the LIBERTY Endovascular Robotic Surgical System. We also raised approximately 5.05 million
in gross proceeds, before fees and expenses of approximately 661,000, from financing activities through September 30, 2024, and raised
an aggregate of approximately 734,000 in gross proceeds, before fees and expenses of approximately 49,000, through our recently reinstated
At-the-Market Agreement with HC Wainwright (the ATM Agreement since July 1, 2024. To the extent available, Microbot intends
to raise capital through future public and private issuances of debt and/or equity securities, including continuing to raise capital,
if available, pursuant to the ATM Agreement until the maximum of 4,819,905 is raised. The capital raises from issuances of convertible
debt and equity securities could result in additional dilution to Microbot s shareholders. In addition, to the extent Microbot
determines to incur additional indebtedness, Microbot s incurrence of additional debt could result in debt service obligations
and operating and financing covenants that would restrict its operations. Microbot can provide no assurance that financing will be available
in the amounts it needs, at the times it needs it or on terms acceptable to it, if at all.

believes we have sufficient funds for our operations for less than one year. As a result of the foregoing and our current cash position,
these conditions raise substantial doubt about Microbot s ability to continue as a going concern, which could adversely affect
our ability to raise capital, expand our business and develop our planned products. The accompanying consolidated interim condensed financial
statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and reclassification of assets or
the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Cash
Flows 

The
following table provides a summary of the net cash flow activity for each of the nine-month periods presented (in
thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 

2024 
 2023 
 
 Net cash flows used in operating activities 
 (7,136 
 (6,712 
 
 Net cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities 
 42 
 (984 
 
 Net cash flows provided by financing activities 
 5,104 
 6,558 
 
 Decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 (1,990 
 (1,138 

The
increase in net cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily
due to ceasing our cost reduction plan which was implemented in 2023, which led to an increase in the net loss in the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 as costs again increased. 

The increase in net cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was mainly due to the timing of purchases, sales and maturities of our marketable
securities portfolio. 

The decrease in net cash flows provided by financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was due to a decrease in net proceeds received from fundraising activities from
2023 to 2024.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Interest
Rate Risk 

Microbot s
cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 consisted of readily available checking and money market funds. Microbot s primary
exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. However,
because of the short-term nature of the instruments in Microbot s portfolio, a sudden change in market interest rates would not
be expected to have a material impact on Microbot s financial condition and/or results of operations. Microbot does not believe
that its cash or cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While Microbot believes its cash and cash equivalents
do not contain excessive risk, Microbot cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future its investments will not be subject to adverse
changes in market value. In addition, Microbot maintains significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions
that are in excess of federally insured limits. 

Foreign
Exchange Risks 

Our
financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and financial results are denominated in U.S. dollars, while a significant portion
of our business is conducted, and a substantial portion of our operating expenses are payable, in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 

Exchange
rate fluctuations may have an adverse impact on our future revenues, if any, or expenses as presented in the financial statements. We
may in the future use financial instruments, such as forward foreign currency contracts, in its management of foreign currency exposure.
These contracts would primarily require us to purchase and sell certain foreign currencies with or for U.S. dollars at contracted rates.
We may be exposed to a credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties of these contracts. In addition, these financial
instruments may not adequately manage our foreign currency exposure. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are
unable to successfully manage currency fluctuations in the future. 

Effects
of Inflation 

Inflation
generally affects Microbot by increasing its research and development expenses. Microbot does not believe that inflation and changing
prices had a significant impact on its results of operations for any periods presented herein. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). As required by Rule 13a-15(b)
under the Exchange Act, management of the Company, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, reviewed
and performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that review and evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, along with the management of the Company, have determined that as of September 30, 2024, the disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control
that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

PART
II 

OTHER
INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However,
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may
harm business. 

See
 Note 3.H. Mona Litigation: , to the financial statements included earlier in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Other
than the foregoing, we are not currently a party in any legal proceeding or governmental regulatory proceeding nor are we currently aware
of any pending or potential legal proceeding or governmental regulatory proceeding proposed to be initiated against us, in any case that
would have a material adverse effect on us or our business. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

Except
as set forth below, there have been no material changes to our risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023. For a further discussion of our Risk Factors, refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

There
can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. If we are not able to comply with
the applicable continued listing requirements or standards of the Nasdaq Capital Markets, Nasdaq could delist our common stock. 

Our
common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and
other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding minimum stockholders equity, minimum market value,
minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements. 

On
October 9, 2024, we received a deficiency letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications department of The Nasdaq
Stock Market, LLC, notifying us that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum
Bid Price Requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as the minimum bid price of our common stock on the
Nasdaq Capital Market was below 1.00 for 30 consecutive business days, from August 26, 2024 to October 7, 2024. 

We
may not be in a position to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or remain in compliance with any other listing
requirements or standards. 

If
Nasdaq delists our common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we and our stockholders could
face significant material adverse consequences including: 

a
 limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 
 
 reduced
 liquidity for our securities; 
 
 a
 determination that common stock is penny stock which will require brokers trading
 in the common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level
 of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 
 
 a
 limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 
 
 a
 decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

The
National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the
sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. To the extent our common stock are listed on Nasdaq,
they are covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow
the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states
can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities
would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. 

Upon
delisting from Nasdaq, our common stock may be traded, if at all , in the over-the-counter inter-dealer quotation system, more commonly
known as the OTC. OTC transactions involve risks in addition to those associated with transactions in securities traded on securities
exchanges such as Nasdaq. Many OTC stocks trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than exchange-listed stocks. Accordingly, our
stock would be less liquid than it would be otherwise. Also, the values of OTC stocks are often more volatile than exchange-listed stocks.
Additionally, institutional investors are often prohibited from investing in OTC stocks, and it might be more challenging to raise capital
when needed. 

In
addition, if our common stock is delisted, your ability to transfer or sell your shares of our common stock may be limited and the value
of those securities will be materially adversely affected.

5. Other Information. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer, as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,
