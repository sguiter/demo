Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 16, 2021 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. The Company announced on November 4, 2024 that because it did not complete its initial business combination by November 2, 2024, it has decided to dissolve and liquidate with a redemption of its public shares expected to occur on November 15, 2024. Prior to the Company s accouncement, our intention was to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from March 16, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024, were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and identifying a target company for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues as a result of its November 4, 2024 announcement to dissolve and liquidate. Prior to our announcement, we generated non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We incurred expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 610,208, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 1,423,400, offset by an unrealized loss on marketable securities held in Trust Account of 3,802, operating costs of 521,774 and provision for income taxes of 287,616. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 3,055,078, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 5,210,147, offset by operating costs of 1,138,297 and provision for income taxes of 1,016,772. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 1,193,412, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 1,888,100, offset by unrealized loss on marketable securities held in Trust Account of 51,242, operating costs of 275,991, and provision for income taxes of 367,455.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 2,309,197, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 4,001,782 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in Trust Account of 14,515, offset by operating costs of 898,670 and provision for income taxes of 808,430. Liquidity and Capital Resources On March 2, 2023, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 13,800,000 Units, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 1,800,000 Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 138,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 4,260,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 6,390,000. Following the Initial Public Offering, the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, a total of 139,380,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred 8,385,876 consisting of 2,484,000 of underwriting fees, net of 276,000 reimbursed by the underwriter, 4,830,000 of deferred underwriting fees, and 1,071,876 of other offering costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 2,289,251. Net income of 3,055,078 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 5,210,147. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used 134,182 of cash for operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 1,236,942. Net income of 2,309,197 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 4,001,782 and unrealized gain on marketable securities held in Trust Account of 14,515. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 470,158 of cash for operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 40,751,549 (including approximately 2,381,504 of interest income that has not been withdrawn) consisting of money market funds. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through September 30, 2024, we have withdrawn 2,582,353 of interest earned from the Trust Account. Prior to our announcement to redeem all our public shares, we had intended to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt was used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account would have been used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash of 184,174 and restricted cash of 134,246. Prior to our announcement of our intention to dissolve and liquidate, we had intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete an initial business combination. Subsequent to the announcement of our intention to dissolve and liquidate, we intend to use such funds to pay expenses associated with the liquidation and to settle outstanding liabilities of the Company. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an initial business combination, the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates might have, but were not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we had completed an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. As we have not completed a Business Combination within the Combination Period and have announced our intention to dissolve and liquidate, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 2,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of 1.50 per warrant, at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. The Company announced on November 4, 2024 that because it did not complete its initial business combination by November 2, 2024, it has decided to dissolve and liquidate with a redemption of its public shares expected to occur on November 15, 2024. We have determined that such mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution and the liquidity issue raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time which is considered to be one year from the date of the issuance of the condensed financial statements. The condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 0.35 per Unit, or 4,830,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee would have become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we completed an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that feature redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. Our Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders (deficit) equity section of our condensed balance sheets. Net Income Per Common Share We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Net income per common share, basic and diluted for Class A redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing the interest income earned on the Trust Account, net of applicable franchise and income taxes, by the weighted average number of Class A redeemable common stock outstanding for the period. Net income per common share, basic and diluted for Class B non-redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing the net income, less income attributable to Class A redeemable common stock, by the weighted average number of Class B non-redeemable common stock outstanding for the period presented. Recent Accounting Standards Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our condensed financial statements.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not required for smaller reporting companies. Item 4.
