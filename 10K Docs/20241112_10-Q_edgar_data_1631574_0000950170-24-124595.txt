 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the representatives of the underwriters in connection with the previously disclosed underwritten public offering (the September 2024 Offering exercised their option in full to purchase an additional ordinary shares, for additional net proceeds of approximately million to the Company. The Company expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next twelve months. The Company has based this expectation on the best information available, however the Company may use its available capital resources sooner than it currently expects. If the Company s anticipated operating results are not achieved in future periods, planned expenditures may need to be further reduced in order to extend the time period over which the then-available resources would be able to fund the Company s operations. In addition, the Company may elect to raise additional funds before it needs them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable due to market conditions or strategic considerations, even if the Company expects it has sufficient funds for its current or future operating plans.

The 2021 Plan authorizes (and the 2014 Plan previously authorized) the Company s board of directors or a committee of the board of directors to, among other things, grant non-qualified share options, restricted awards, which include restricted shares and restricted share units RSUs ), and performance awards to eligible employees and directors of the Company. The Company accounts for grants to its board of directors as grants to employees. Options generally vest over periods of one to , and options that are forfeited or cancelled are available to be granted again. The contractual life of options is generally five or from the grant date. RSUs can be time-based or performance-based. Time-based RSUs generally vest over a period of one to . The vesting of performance-based RSUs is contingent on the achievement of certain performance milestones. Any RSUs that are forfeited are available to be granted again. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted an aggregate of options and time-based RSUs to employees and non-employee directors. As of September 30, 2024 , ordinary shares remained available for future grant under the 2021 Plan.

The Wave Life Sciences Ltd. 2019 Employee Share Purchase Plan, as amended (the ESPP ), allows full-time and certain part-time employees to purchase the Company s ordinary shares at a discount to fair market value. Eligible employees may enroll in a six-month offering period beginning every January 15th and July 15th. Ordinary shares are purchased at a price equal to of the lower of the fair market value of the Company s ordinary shares on the first business day or the last business day of an offering period. The aggregate number of ordinary shares authorized for issuance under the ESPP was originally and was subsequently increased to in August 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , ordinary shares were issued under the ESPP. As of September 30, 2024 , there were ordinary shares available for issuance under the ESPP. 

 million. Simultaneously with the execution of the GSK Collaboration Agreement, Wave entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the SPA on December 13, 2022, with Glaxo Group Limited GGL ), an affiliate of GSK, pursuant to which Wave agreed to sell of its ordinary shares to GGL at a purchase price of per share (the GSK Equity Investment ). The GSK Equity Investment closed on January 26, 2023, following the completion of customary closing conditions. The ordinary shares purchased by GGL are subject to lock-up and standstill restrictions and carry certain registration rights, customary for transactions of this kind. The Company did not incur any material costs in connection with the issuance of the ordinary shares under the SPA.

million upfront, the million in premium related to the GSK Equity Investment and the fixed consideration related to the additional target validation research funding. The Company allocated the estimated variable consideration relating to the target validation research to the Discovery Research Collaboration and the variable consideration relating to the development milestone to the AATD Collaboration and then allocated the fixed consideration to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company determined that the GSK Collaboration Agreement did not contain a significant financing component. The program initiation fees to advance up to eight programs from the Discovery Research Collaboration to preclinically develop the GSK collaboration programs and the additional potential milestone payments were excluded from the transaction price, as all milestone amounts were fully constrained at the inception of the GSK Collaboration Agreement. The Company will reevaluate the transaction price at the end of each reporting period, and as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur, the Company will adjust its estimate of the transaction price. Under the GSK Collaboration Agreement, GSK can advance up to eight programs leveraging Wave s PRISM platform and multiple RNA-targeting modalities (RNA editing, splicing, siRNA, and antisense) with target validation work ongoing across multiple therapy areas. GSK selected its first two programs to advance to development candidates following achievement of target validation in the three months ended June 30, 2024 . These programs utilize Wave s next generation GalNAc-siRNA format and are in hepatology. Under the GSK Collaboration Agreement, GSK is required to provide an aggregate initiation payment of million to Wave for these two oligonucleotide programs, for which the million was received during the three months ended June 30, 2024 .

 The Company developed the estimated standalone selling price for the global license for WVE-006, under the AATD Collaboration, using a discounted cash flow model. For the performance obligation associated with the research and development services under the Discovery Research Collaboration and the research and development services for WVE-006 under the AATD Collaboration, the Company determined the standalone selling price using estimates of the costs to perform the research and development services, including expected internal and external costs for services and supplies, adjusted to reflect a profit margin. The total estimated cost of the research and development services reflected the nature of the services to be performed and the Company s best estimate of the length of time required to perform the services. Revenue associated with the AATD Collaboration performance obligation is being recognized as the research and development services are provided using an input measure, according to the costs incurred and the total costs expected to be incurred to satisfy the performance obligation. The revenue associated with the Discovery Research Collaboration performance obligation is being recognized as the research and development services are provided using an input measure, according to the costs incurred and the total costs expected to be incurred to satisfy the performance obligation. The amounts received that have not yet been recognized as revenue are recorded in deferred revenue on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. Additional funding related to the Company s research activities related to Discovery Research Collaboration will be recorded as accounts receivable when contractually enforceable and recorded as deferred revenue, or as revenue as the services are provided. During the year ended December 31, 2023 , the Company achieved a developmental milestone which pertained to the initiation of dosing in healthy volunteers in the RestorAATion clinical trial program, triggering a million milestone payment to the Company from GSK. As of December 31, 2023, the million related to the achievement of the milestone was included in the current portion of accounts receivable and payment was received from GSK in the first quarter of 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an million reduction to cumulative revenue due to a change in the estimate to fulfill the GSK Collaboration performance obligations . For the three months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recognized revenue of million under the GSK Collaboration Agreement using the input method described above. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of million and million , respectively, using the input method described above. Through September 30, 2024, the Company had recognized revenue of million under the GSK Collaboration Agreement as collaboration revenue in the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Takeda Collaboration and Equity Agreements In , Wave USA and Wave UK entered into a global strategic collaboration (the Takeda Collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited Takeda ), pursuant to which Wave USA, Wave UK and Takeda agreed to collaborate on the research, development and commercialization of oligonucleotide therapeutics for disorders of the Central Nervous System CNS ). The Takeda Collaboration provides the Company with at least million in committed cash and Takeda with the option to co-develop and co-commercialize the Company s CNS development programs in (1) Huntington s disease HD (2) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS and frontotemporal dementia FTD and (3) the Company s discovery-stage program targeting ATXN3 for the treatment of spinocerebellar ataxia 3 SCA3 (collectively, Category 1 Programs ). In addition, the Takeda Collaboration provided Takeda the right to exclusively license multiple preclinical programs for CNS disorders, including Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease (collectively, Category 2 Programs ). In April 2018, the Takeda Collaboration became effective and Takeda paid the Company million as an upfront payment. Takeda also agreed to fund the Company s research and preclinical activities in the amount of million during the research term and to reimburse the Company for any collaboration-budgeted research and preclinical expenses incurred by Wave that exceed that amount. Simultaneously with Wave USA and Wave UK s entry into the collaboration and license agreement with Takeda dated February 19, 2018, as amended (the Takeda Collaboration Agreement ), the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with Takeda (the Takeda Equity Agreement, and together with the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, the Takeda Agreements pursuant to which it agreed to sell to Takeda of its ordinary shares at a purchase price of per share. In , the Company closed the Takeda Equity Agreement and received aggregate cash proceeds of million. The Company did not incur any material costs in connection with the issuance of the shares. With respect to Category 1 Programs, the Company will be responsible for researching and developing products and companion diagnostics for Category 1 Programs through completion of the first proof of mechanism study for such products. Takeda will have an exclusive option for each target and all associated products and companion diagnostics for such target, which it may exercise at any time through completion of the proof of mechanism study. If Takeda exercises this option, the Company will receive an opt-in payment and will lead manufacturing and joint clinical co-development activities and Takeda will lead joint co-commercial activities in the United States and all commercial activities outside of the United States. Global costs and potential profits will be shared : and the Company will be eligible to receive development and commercial milestone payments. In addition to its 50 profit share, the Company is eligible to receive option exercise fees and development and commercial milestone payments for each of the Category 1 Programs. With respect to Category 2 Programs, the Company granted Takeda the right to exclusively license multiple preclinical programs during a research term (subject to limited extension for programs that were initiated prior to the expiration of the research term, in accordance with the Takeda Collaboration Agreement) Category 2 Research Term ). During that term, the Takeda Collaboration provided that the parties may collaborate on preclinical programs for up to targets at . The Company was responsible for researching and preclinically developing products and companion diagnostics directed to the agreed upon targets through completion of Investigational IND enabling studies in the first major market country. Thereafter, Takeda would have an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize products and companion diagnostics directed to such targets, subject to the Company s retained rights to lead manufacturing activities for products directed to such targets. Takeda agreed to fund the Company s research and preclinical activities in the amount of million during the research term and reimburse the Company for any collaboration-budgeted research and preclinical expenses incurred by the Company that exceeded that amount. The Company was also eligible to receive tiered high single-digit to mid-teen royalties on Takeda s global commercial sales of products from each Category 2 Program. Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, each party granted to the other party specific intellectual property licenses to enable the other party to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, including license grants to enable each party to conduct research, development and commercialization activities pursuant to the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement.

and, unless terminated earlier, will continue until the date on which: (i) with respect to each Category 1 Program target for which Takeda does not exercise its option, the expiration or termination of the development program with respect to such target; (ii) with respect to each Category 1 Program target for which Takeda exercises its option, the date on which neither party is researching, developing or manufacturing any products or companion diagnostics directed to such target; or (iii) with respect to each Category 2 Program target, the date on which royalties are no longer payable with respect to products directed to such target. Takeda may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement for convenience on days notice, in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis. Subject to certain exceptions, each party has the right to terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement on a target-by-target basis if the other party, or a third party related to such party, challenges the patentability, enforceability or validity of any patents within the licensed technology that cover any product or companion diagnostic that is subject to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. In the event of any material breach of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement by a party, subject to cure rights, the other party may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in its entirety if the breach relates to all targets or on a target-by-target basis if the breach relates to a specific target. In the event that Takeda and its affiliates cease development, manufacturing and commercialization activities with respect to compounds or products subject to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement and directed to a particular target, the Company may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement with respect to such target. Either party may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement for the other party s insolvency. In certain termination circumstances, the Company would receive a license from Takeda to continue researching, developing and manufacturing certain products, and companion diagnostics. The Takeda Collaboration is managed by a joint steering committee in which both parties are represented equally. The joint steering committee is tasked with overseeing the scientific progression of each Category 1 Program and, prior to the Amendment (discussed below), the Category 2 Programs. The Company assessed this arrangement in accordance with ASC 606 and concluded that the contract counterparty, Takeda, is a customer for Category 1 Programs prior to Takeda exercising its option, and for Category 2 Programs during the Category 2 Research Term. The Company identified the following material promises under the arrangement: (1) the non-exclusive, royalty-free research and development license for each Category 1 Program; (2) the research and development services for each Category 1 Program through completion of the first proof of mechanism study; (3) the exclusive option to license, co-develop and co-commercialize each Category 1 Program; (4) the right to exclusively license the Category 2 Programs; and (5) the research and preclinical development services of the Category 2 Programs through completion of IND-enabling studies. The research and development services for each Category 1 Program were determined to not be distinct from the research and development license and should therefore be combined into a single performance obligation for each Category 1 Program. The research and preclinical development services for the Category 2 Programs were determined to not be distinct from the exclusive licenses for the Category 2 Programs and therefore were combined into a single performance obligation. Additionally, the Company determined that the exclusive option for each Category 1 Program was priced at a discount, and, as such, provide material rights to Takeda, representing three separate performance obligations. Based on these assessments, the Company identified seven performance obligations in the Takeda Collaboration Agreement: (1) research and development services through completion of the first proof of mechanism and non-exclusive research and development license for HD; (2) research and development services through completion of the first proof of mechanism and non-exclusive research and development license for ALS and FTD; (3) research and development services through completion of the first proof of mechanism and non-exclusive research and development license for SCA3; (4) the material right provided for the exclusive option to license, co-develop and co-commercialize HD; (5) the material right provided for the exclusive option to license, co-develop and co-commercialize ALS and FTD; (6) the material right provided for the exclusive option to license, co-develop and co-commercialize SCA3; and (7) the research and preclinical development services and right to exclusively license the Category 2 Programs. At the outset of the arrangement, the transaction price included the million upfront consideration received and the million of committed research and preclinical funding for the Category 2 Programs. The Company determined that the Takeda Collaboration Agreement did not contain a significant financing component. The option exercise fees to license, co-develop and co-commercialize each Category 1 Program that may be received are excluded from the transaction price until each customer option is exercised. The potential milestone payments were excluded from the transaction price, as all milestone amounts were fully constrained at the inception of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. The Company will reevaluate the transaction price at the end of each reporting period and as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur, if necessary, will adjust its estimate of the transaction price.

, Wave USA, Wave UK and Takeda entered into the Second Amendment to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement (the Amendment ), which discontinued the Category 2 component of the Takeda Collaboration. The Category 1 Programs under the Collaboration Agreement remain in effect and are unchanged by the Amendment. Pursuant to the Amendment, Takeda agreed to pay the Company an additional million as full payment for reimbursable Category 2 Programs collaboration-budgeted research and preclinical expenses. The Company received this payment from Takeda related to the Category 2 component and recognized the full amount as collaboration revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021. In May 2023, the Company announced its decision to discontinue clinical development of WVE-004 for C9orf72-associated ALS and FTD C9 for ALS/FTD ), one of the Category 1 Programs. In July 2023, the joint steering committee that manages the Takeda Collaboration terminated C9 for ALS/FTD as a target under the collaboration (the C9 Target and consequently Takeda and the Company s rights and obligations under the Takeda Collaboration were terminated with respect to the C9 Target. As a result of the termination of the C9 for ALS/FTD Category 1 Program, the Company recognized million in revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which represented the remainder of the deferred revenue for the C9 for ALS/FTD Category 1 Program as of June 30, 2023. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company achieved a developmental milestone related to the HD Category 1 Program, which pertained to the positive results from a non-clinical study of WVE-003 in non-human primates NHPs ). As a result of achieving the milestone, the Company recognized million in revenue, which was not previously recorded in deferred revenue, as it was fully constrained at the inception of the Takeda Collaboration. In December 2023, the joint steering committee that manages the Takeda Collaboration terminated the SCA3 Category 1 Program as a target under the collaboration and consequently, Takeda and the Company s rights and obligations under the Takeda Collaboration were terminated with respect to the SCA3 Category 1 Program. As a result of the termination of the SCA3 Category 1 Program, the Company million in revenue during the three months ended December 31, 2023, which represented the remainder of the deferred revenue for the SCA3 Category 1 Program as of September 30, 2023. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, on October 11, 2024, the Company was notified by Takeda that Takeda did not intend to exercise and therefore elected to terminate its option Option Termination for the HD target under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. As HD was the last active collaboration target under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, the Takeda Collaboration Agreement expired with immediate effect.

million and million, respectively, under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of approximately million and million, respectively, under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. Through September 30, 2024, the Company had recognized revenue of million under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement as collaboration revenue in the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the Company s unsatisfied and partially unsatisfied performance obligations and recorded in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million , respectively, and all of the deferred revenue was included in current liabilities. The Company expects to recognize the remaining deferred revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024.

These 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants were recorded as a component of shareholders equity within additional paid-in capital. The gross proceeds to the Company from the September 2024 Offering were million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. The net proceeds to the Company from the September 2024 Offering were approximately million after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses. The 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants are exercisable at any time after their original issuance and on or prior to the five-year anniversary of the original issuance date. A holder of the 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants may not exercise the warrant if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own more than (or at the election of such holder, or of the number of the Company s ordinary shares outstanding or more than (or at the election of such holder, or of the combined voting power of the Company s securities outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise, unless and until shareholder approval is obtained. ordinary shares, which increased the aggregate number of ordinary shares sold in the September 2024 Offering to .

2024 Pre-Funded Warrants, which are included in the total vested and exercisable pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded Warrants ). As of September 30, 2024 , there are vested and exercisable Pre-Funded Warrants outstanding to purchase ordinary shares for the exercise price of per share, provided that, unless and until the Company obtains shareholder approval for the issuance of the shares underlying the Pre-Funded Warrants, a holder will not be entitled to exercise any portion of any Pre-Funded Warrant, which, upon giving effect to such exercise, would cause (i) the aggregate number of our ordinary shares beneficially owned by the holder (together with its affiliates) to exceed (or at the election of such holder, or of the number of our ordinary shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, or (ii) the combined voting power of our securities beneficially owned by the holder (together with its affiliates) to exceed (or at the election of such holder, or of the combined voting power of all of our securities then outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Pre-Funded Warrants. The Pre-Funded Warrants are included in the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of basic net loss per share as the exercise price is negligible and the warrants are fully vested and exercisable. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and Pre-Funded Warrant holders by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares and Pre-Funded Warrants outstanding. The Company s potentially dilutive shares, which include outstanding share options to purchase ordinary shares, RSUs, and Series A preferred shares, are considered to be ordinary share equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 6, 2024, as amended (the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K ). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Risk Factor section of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on unlocking the broad potential of ribonucleic acid RNA medicines (also known as oligonucleotides), or those targeting RNA, to transform human health. Our RNA medicines platform, PRISM , combines multiple modalities, chemistry innovation and deep insights into human genetics to deliver scientific breakthroughs that treat both rare and prevalent disorders. Our toolkit of RNA-targeting modalities includes RNA editing, splicing, antisense silencing and RNA interference RNAi"), providing us with unique capabilities for designing and sustainably delivering candidates that optimally address disease biology. Our lead programs are in rare and prevalent diseases, including alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency AATD ), obesity, Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD ), and Huntington s disease HD ). 
 We were founded on the recognition that there was a significant, untapped opportunity to use chemistry innovation to tune the pharmacological properties of oligonucleotides. Today, we have more than a decade of experience challenging convention related to oligonucleotide design and pioneering novel chemistry modifications to optimize the pharmacological properties of our molecules. We have seen preclinically and in clinical trials that these chemistry modifications enhance potency, distribution, and durability of effect of our molecules. Our novel chemistry also allows us to avoid using complex delivery vehicles, such as lipid nanoparticles and viruses, and instead use clinically proven conjugates e.g., N -acetylgalactosamine or GalNAc )) or free uptake for delivery to a variety of cell and tissue types. We maintain strong and broad intellectual property, including for our novel chemistry modifications. 
 Our best-in-class chemistry capabilities have also unlocked new areas of biology, such as harnessing adenosine deaminases acting on RNA ADAR enzymes for messenger RNA mRNA correction and upregulation, selectively silencing a mutant allele, and more. By opening up new areas of biology, we have also opened up new opportunities to slow, stop or reverse disease and have expanded the possibilities offered through our platform. 
 The inspiration for our multimodal platform is based on the recognition that the biological machinery (i.e., enzymes) needed to address human disease already exists within our cells and can be harnessed for therapeutic purposes with the right tools. We believe that we have built the most versatile toolkit of RNA-targeting modalities in the industry, with multiple means of repairing, restoring, or reducing proteins and designing best-fit solutions based on the unique biology of a given disease target. We are actively advancing programs in all of our modalities. 

21 

We intentionally focus on targeting the transcriptome using oligonucleotides rather than other nucleic acid modalities such as gene therapy and DNA editing. This focus enables us to: 
 Leverage diversity of expression across cell types by modulating the many regulatory pathways that impact gene expression, including transcription, endogenous RNA interference pathways, splicing, and translation; 

Address diseases that have historically been difficult to treat with small molecules or biologics; 

Access a variety of tissue types or cell types throughout the body and modulate the frequency of dosing for broad distribution in tissues over time; 

Avoid the risk of permanent off-target genetic changes and other challenges associated with DNA editing or gene therapy approaches; and 

Leverage well-established industry manufacturing processes and regulatory, access, and reimbursement pathways. 

We have a robust and diverse pipeline of potential first-or best-in-class programs, including: 
 GalNAc-conjugated oligonucleotides for hepatic and metabolic diseases including: 

o AATD: WVE-006 is a GalNAc-conjugated SERPINA1 RNA editing oligonucleotide; 

o Obesity: WVE-007 is a GalNAc-conjugated RNAi oligonucleotide targeting inhibin E INHBE 

o Liver disease: GalNAc-conjugated RNA editing oligonucleotide targeting PNPLA3 I148M for correction; and 

o Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia HeFH ): GalNAc-conjugated RNA editing oligonucleotide targeting low-density lipoprotein receptor LDLR for upregulation and GalNAc-conjugated RNA editing oligonucleotide targeting apolipoprotein B APOB for correction. 

Unconjugated oligonucleotides for muscle, CNS and other disease areas including: 

o DMD: WVE-N531 is an exon 53 splicing oligonucleotide; and 

o HD: WVE-003 is an allele-selective oligonucleotide designed to lower mutant huntingtin mHTT protein and preserve healthy, wild-type huntingtin wtHTT protein. 

We are also building a pipeline of novel A-to-I RNA editing oligonucleotides AIMers ). Our RNA editing capability affords us the dexterity to address both rare diseases, as well as those diseases impacting large patient populations. AIMers are designed to target single bases on an RNA transcript and recruit proteins that exist in the body, called ADAR enzymes, which naturally possess the ability to change an adenine (A) to an inosine (I), which cells read as guanine (G). This approach enables both the correction of G-to-A point mutations and the modulation of RNA to either upregulate protein expression, modify protein-protein interactions, or alter RNA folding and processing. AIMers enable simplified delivery and avoid the risk of permanent changes to the genome and irreversible off-target effects with DNA-targeting approaches. AIMers are short in length, fully chemically modified, and use our novel chemistry, which make them distinct from other ADAR-mediated editing approaches. 
 In December 2022, we announced a strategic collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property (No. 3) GSK to advance transformative oligonucleotide therapeutics, including WVE-006. The collaboration combines GSK s novel genetic insights, as well as its global development and commercial capabilities, with our PRISM platform and oligonucleotide expertise. The collaboration will enable us to continue building a pipeline of first-in-class oligonucleotide-based therapeutics and unlock new areas of disease biology, as well as realize the full value of WVE-006 as a potential best-in-class treatment for AATD that has the potential to simultaneously address both liver and lung manifestations of the disease. 
 Our GSK collaboration has three components: 
 (1) A discovery collaboration which enables us to advance up to three programs leveraging targets informed by GSK s novel insights, the first of which is our INHBE program (WVE-007) for obesity and other metabolic disorders; 
 (2) A discovery collaboration which enables GSK to advance up to eight programs leveraging PRISM and our oligonucleotide expertise and discovery capabilities, the first two of which were selected in April 2024; and 
 (3) An exclusive global license for GSK to WVE-006, our AATD program, that uses our proprietary AIMer technology. We will maintain development responsibilities for WVE-006 through completion of RestorAATion-2, at which point development and commercial responsibilities will transition to GSK. 
 22 

Our Current Programs 

Additional details regarding our lead therapeutic programs are set forth below. 
 Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency AATD 
 Our AATD program is the first to leverage our novel RNA editing capability and uses GalNAc-conjugated AIMers (RNA editing oligonucleotides) and endogenous ADAR enzymes to correct a single base in the mutant SERPINA1 mRNA. By correcting the single RNA base mutation that causes a majority of AATD cases with the Pi ZZ genotype (approximately 200,000 in the United States and Europe), RNA editing may provide an ideal approach for increasing circulating levels of wild-type Alpha-1 antitrypsin AAT protein and reducing mutant protein aggregation in the liver, thus simultaneously addressing both the lung and liver manifestations of the disease. 
 WVE-006 is first-in-class in AATD and is the most advanced program currently in development using an oligonucleotide to harness an endogenous enzyme for RNA editing. Our RestorAATion clinical program investigating WVE-006 as a treatment for AATD is ongoing. The RestorAATion clinical program includes both healthy volunteers RestorAATion-1 ), as well as patients with AATD who have the homozygous Pi ZZ mutation RestorAATion-2 and is designed to provide an efficient path to proof-of-mechanism as measured by restoration of wild-type alpha-1 antitrypsin M-AAT protein in serum. RestorAATion-2 is a Phase 1b/2a open label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics PD and pharmacokinetics PK of WVE-006 in individuals with AATD who have the homozygous Pi ZZ mutation. The trial includes both single ascending dose SAD and multiple ascending dose MAD portions. In the third quarter of 2024, we initiated dosing in the single dose portion of the first dose cohort of RestorAATion-2. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced positive proof-of-mechanism data from the ongoing Phase 1b/2a RestorAATion-2 study, which provided the first-ever clinical demonstration of RNA editing in humans. Following a single subcutaneous dose of 200 mg of WVE-006 in the study s first two patients, circulating wild-type M-AAT protein in plasma reached a mean of 6.9 micromolar at day 15, representing more than 60 of total AAT. Increases in neutrophil elastase inhibition from baseline were consistent with production of functional M-AAT. Mean total AAT protein increased from below the level of quantification at baseline to 10.8 micromolar at day 15, meeting the level that has historically been the basis for regulatory approval for AAT augmentation therapies. Increases in total AAT from baseline and M-AAT protein were observed as early as day 3 and through day 57. WVE-006 has been well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile. All adverse events in RestorAATion-2, as well as in the ongoing RestorAATion-1 trial of healthy volunteers, were mild to moderate, with no Serious Adverse Events reported. The RestorAATion-2 trial is ongoing and we expect to share multidose data in 2025. 
 Under our GSK collaboration, GSK received an exclusive global license for WVE-006, with clinical development and commercial responsibilities transitioning to GSK after we complete the RestorAATion-2 trial. Under the terms of the collaboration, we are eligible to receive up to 525 million in development, launch, and commercial milestone payments, as well as double-digit tiered royalties up to the high teens, as a percentage of net sales for WVE-006. In December 2023, we announced that we achieved the first WVE-006 milestone in our collaboration with GSK, resulting in a 20.0 million payment. 
 Preclinical data show that treatment with WVE-006 resulted in serum AAT protein levels of up to 30 micromolar in an established AATD mouse model (NSG-PiZ). WVE-006 also led to restoration of approximately 50 wild-type M-AAT protein in serum and a 3-fold increase in neutrophil elastase inhibition activity, indicating that the restored M-AAT protein was functional. Our AATD AIMers are highly specific to SERPINA1 RNA in vitro and in vivo based on transcriptome-wide analyses. 
 23 

Obesity and Other Metabolic Disorders 
 Our first wholly owned program to emerge from our collaboration with GSK is WVE-007, a GalNAc-small interfering RNA siRNA that is designed to silence the Inhibin E gene INHBE to induce lipolysis (fat-burning) while preserving muscle mass to restore and maintain a healthy metabolic profile. There are approximately 174 million people in the United States and Europe living with obesity, and therapeutic options beyond GLP-1 receptor agonists are needed. GLP-1 receptor agonists lead to weight loss at the expense of muscle, suppress the general reward system, and are associated with a poor tolerability profile and 68 drop-off after one year. Heterozygous INHBE loss-of-function human carriers exhibit a healthy metabolic profile, including reduced waist-to-hip ratio and reduced odds of developing type 2 diabetes or coronary artery disease, and reduction of INHBE by 50 or more is expected to restore a healthy metabolic profile. In connection with our 2023 Research and Development Day, we shared in vivo proof-of-concept data in diet-induced obesity mice demonstrating INHBE silencing well beyond the anticipated 50 therapeutic threshold, which led to substantially lower body weight and reduction of visceral fat as compared to controls. These are the first data to demonstrate INHBE silencing in vivo in an animal model is consistent with the phenotypes of heterozygous loss-of-function carriers. 
 WVE-007 utilizes our next generation GalNAc-siRNA format. In preclinical diet-induced obesity DIO mouse models, our INHBE GalNAc-siRNA has demonstrated highly potent INHBE silencing (ED50 
 24 

Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD 
 In DMD, we are advancing WVE-N531, which is designed to skip exon 53 within the dystrophin gene a therapeutic approach that would address approximately 8-10 of DMD cases. WVE-N531 is designed to cause the cellular splicing machinery to skip over exon 53 during pre-mRNA processing, which restores the dystrophin mRNA reading frame and enables production of a truncated, but functional, dystrophin protein. Exon skipping produces dystrophin from the endogenous dystrophin gene (not micro or mini dystrophin expressed from a foreign vector), under the control of native gene-regulatory elements, resulting in normal expression. WVE-N531 is our first splicing candidate incorporating PN backbone PN chemistry to be assessed in the clinic. In the third quarter of 2024, the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Orphan Drug Designation to WVE-N531. 
 In December 2022, we announced a positive update from Part A of the Phase 1b/2a proof-of-concept, open label trial of WVE-N531 in three boys with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping. High muscle concentrations of WVE-N531 and exon skipping were observed six weeks after initiating multi-dosing at 10 mg/kg every other week, achieving proof-of-concept in the trial. WVE-N531 also appeared safe and well-tolerated. 
 In September 2023, we shared an analysis of muscle biopsy data from the Part A proof-of-concept trial indicating that WVE-N531 was present in myogenic stem cells, which are integral to muscle regeneration. This is the first demonstration of uptake in myogenic stem cells in a clinical study and supports the potential differentiation of WVE-N531 from other therapeutics, including gene therapies. 
 In December 2023, we initiated dosing of WVE-N531 in FORWARD-53, the Phase 2 portion of the open-label trial Part B ). The study is designed to administer 10 mg/kg infusions of WVE-N531 every two weeks Q2W and muscle biopsies are taken after 24 and 48 weeks of dosing. The primary endpoint will be dystrophin protein levels, and the trial will also evaluate pharmacokinetics, digital and functional endpoints, and safety and tolerability. 
 In September 2024, we announced positive interim data from the ongoing Phase 2 FORWARD-53 study. Eleven boys amenable to exon 53 skipping (age 5-11; 10 ambulatory and 1 non-ambulatory) are enrolled. The interim analysis was conducted after 24 weeks of 10 mg/kg dosing Q2W. WVE-N531 appeared safe and well tolerated. We observed mean muscle content-adjusted dystrophin expression of 9.0 and unadjusted dystrophin of 5.5 , with high consistency across participants, in a prespecified analysis. Dystrophin expression was quantified from two isoforms consistent with those observed in Becker muscular dystrophy patients who display milder disease. In addition, we observed meaningful improvements in serum biomarkers for muscle health, with localization of WVE-N531 present in myogenic stem cells and regeneration of myofibers. Skeletal muscle concentrations of ~41,000 ng/g and 61-day tissue half-life observed support monthly dosing going forward. 
 In the first quarter of 2025, we expect to deliver the complete 48-week FORWARD-53 data, and receive feedback from regulators on a pathway to accelerated approval. Pending positive results from this trial, we are planning to advance a broader DMD pipeline with PN-modified splicing oligonucleotides designed to skip other exons, with the goal of providing new treatment options for a larger population of boys with DMD. 
 Huntington s disease HD 
 In HD, we are currently advancing WVE-003, a stereopure allele-selective oligonucleotide designed to selectively target an undisclosed single nucleotide polymorphism SNP ), mHTT SNP3 , associated with the disease-causing mHTT mRNA transcript within the Huntingtin HTT gene. Approximately 40 of the HD population carries SNP3 according to published literature (Carroll et al., Molecular Therapy, 2011), and up to 80 of HD may be addressed in the future with other SNP-targeted candidates. There are currently no disease modifying therapies for HD, which affects over 200,000 individuals across all disease stages in the United States and Europe alone. 
 WVE-003 incorporates our proprietary PN chemistry. Targeting mRNA with SNP3 allows us to lower expression of transcript from the mutant allele, while leaving the healthy transcript relatively intact, thereby preserving wild-type (healthy) huntingtin wtHTT protein, which is important for neuronal function. Only an allele-selective approach to mHTT lowering has the potential to both protect the reservoir of wtHTT protein and decrease the mHTT to wtHTT ratio in neurons, potentially releasing wtHTT from the inhibitory actions of mHTT. Our allele-selective approach may also enable us to address HD patient populations in early stages of disease prior to onset of clinical symptoms. In preclinical studies, WVE-003 showed dose-dependent and selective reduction of mHTT mRNA in vitro , as well as potent and durable knockdown of mHTT mRNA and protein in vivo in mouse models. 
 In the third quarter of 2023, we achieved a milestone in our collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited Takeda ), which pertained to the positive results from a non-clinical study of WVE-003 in non-human primates and resulted in a payment of 7.0 million to us. This study showed significant tissue exposure levels of WVE-003 in the deep brain regions, including striatum and bolstered our existing datasets that confirm the ability of our oligonucleotides to distribute to the areas of the CNS important for HD. 
 25 

The SELECT-HD trial was a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2a clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of WVE-003 in people with a confirmed diagnosis of HD who are in the early stages of the disease and carry SNP3 in association with their cytosine-adenine-guanine CAG expansion. Additional objectives included assessing pharmacokinetics and exploratory pharmacodynamic and clinical endpoints. 
 In June 2024, we announced positive clinical data from the Phase 1b/2a SELECT-HD study of WVE-003. Results from the multi-dose portion of the trial, which evaluated three doses of 30mg WVE-003 administered every eight weeks, showed clear translation of target engagement to clinic with statistically significant, potent, durable and allele-selective reductions in cerebrospinal fluid CSF mHTT of up to 46 and preservation of healthy protein. This cohort also revealed a statistically significant correlation between mHTT reductions and slowing of caudate atrophy, indicating a potential benefit of allele-selective mHTT reductions. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging MRI changes such as caudate atrophy are well-characterized measures of disease progression and neurodegeneration in HD. WVE-003 was generally safe and well-tolerated, with mild-to-moderate adverse events AEs and no Serious AEs SAEs ). In November 2024, five months after a patient completed their final safety visit, an SAE was reported that we assessed to be not-related to WVE-003. 
 Following our positive clinical results, we initiated engagement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ). In November 2024, we received supportive initial feedback from FDA, who recognize the severity of HD and are receptive to and engaged with us regarding a potential pathway to accelerated approval. FDA is open to our plan to evaluate biomarkers, including caudate atrophy, as an endpoint to assess HD progression with the potential to predict clinical outcome. Also in November 2024, FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to WVE-003. 
 Planning is underway for a global, potentially registrational Phase 2/3 study, including finalization of key aspects of design. We expect to submit an Investigational New Drug IND application for WVE-003 in the second half of 2025. 
 Discovery Pipeline 
 We are advancing new targets across multiple disease areas to expand our pipeline of wholly owned programs. Our compelling preclinical data indicates our oligonucleotides can distribute to various tissues and cells without complex delivery vehicles, enabling us to address a wide variety of diseases, including pulmonary and renal diseases. Within RNA editing, we have demonstrated preclinically that we can edit to correct monogenic diseases by restoring or correcting protein function for the treatment of AATD. Building on our work in AATD, we have demonstrated our ability to address more prevalent diseases by editing RNA to upregulate or increase the stability of the mRNA transcript, thereby increasing endogenous protein production. Utilizing our proprietary edit-verse, which is powered by genetic datasets and deep learning models, we have identified several RNA editing targets that leverage easily accessible biomarkers, offer efficient paths to proof-of-concept in humans, and represent meaningful commercial opportunities. We demonstrated preclinical proof-of-concept data on several of these new targets in 2023, achieving at least 2-fold mRNA upregulation in liver and kidney targets and more than 60 mRNA correction in liver and lung targets. 
 In October 2024, we announced three new, wholly owned RNA editing programs that are on track for candidate selection in 2025. These programs build on the achievement of proof-of-mechanism for RNA editing with WVE-006. As with WVE-006, these programs leverage GalNAc conjugates and have efficient clinical paths to proof-of-concept. These new programs include PNPLA3, which aims to use mRNA correction to restore the heterozygous phenotype for those at high risk for a variety of liver diseases, and LDLR and APOB which utilize first-in-class mRNA upregulation and mRNA correction treatment approaches to achieve target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients. 
 Through our collaboration with GSK, we are also leveraging GSK s novel genetics insights to expand our wholly owned pipeline, with the first being our INHBE program. In addition, we and GSK are actively working on multiple target validation programs for our GSK-partnered programs, for which all of our costs and expenses are prepaid by GSK. In April 2024, GSK selected its first two programs to advance to development candidates following achievement of target validation, triggering an aggregate initiation payment of 12.0 million from GSK. These programs utilize our next generation GalNAc-siRNA format and are in hepatology. 
 In 2026, we expect to have five GalNAc-conjugated clinical programs, including WVE-006, our WVE-007 siRNA program, and three new RNA editing programs.

Recent Developments 
 As previously disclosed, on September 27, 2024, we closed an underwritten public offering (the September 2024 Offering of 26,875,001 of our ordinary shares at a price of 8.00 per ordinary share and pre-funded warrants (the 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase 1,875,023 ordinary shares at a price of 7.9999 per 2024 Pre-Funded Warrant, for gross proceeds of 200.0 million. On October 1, 2024, the representatives of the underwriters in the September 2024 Offering exercised their option to purchase an additional 3,750,000 ordinary shares, for additional gross proceeds of 30.0 million to us. 
 Financial Operations Overview 
 We have never been profitable, and since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 61.8 million and our net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 7.3 million. Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 126.3 million and 41.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 1,151.1 million and 1,024.9 million, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. 
 Revenue 
 We recognize collaboration revenue under the GSK Collaboration Agreement, which became effective in January 2023, and the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, which became effective in April 2018 (both of which are defined in Note 5 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). We have not generated any product revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include: 
 compensation-related expenses, including employee salaries, bonuses, share-based compensation expense and other related benefits expenses for personnel in our research and development organization; 

expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations CROs that conduct research, preclinical and clinical activities on our behalf, as well as contract manufacturing organizations CMOs that manufacture drug product for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

expenses incurred related to our internal manufacturing of drug substance for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

expenses related to compliance with regulatory requirements; 

expenses related to third-party consultants; 

research and development supplies and services expenses; and 

facility-related expenses, including rent, maintenance and other general operating expenses. 

We recognize research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our financial statements as prepaid or accrued expenses. 
 Our primary research and development focus has been the development of our RNA medicines platform, PRISM. We are using PRISM, which includes our novel chemistry modifications, to design, develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of first- or best-in-class RNA medicines using our editing, RNAi, splicing, and antisense modalities. 
 27 

Our research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses related to our CROs, CMOs, consultants, other external vendors and fees paid to global regulatory agencies to conduct our clinical trials, in addition to compensation-related expenses, internal manufacturing expenses, facility-related expenses and other general operating expenses. These expenses are incurred in connection with research and development efforts and our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We track certain external expenses on a program-by-program basis. However, we do not allocate compensation-related expenses, internal manufacturing expenses, equipment repairs and maintenance expense, facility-related expenses or other operating expenses to specific programs. These expenses, which are not allocated on a program-by-program basis, are included in the Other research and development expenses (1) , including INHBE, RNA editing, PRISM, others category along with other external expenses related to our discovery and development programs, as well as platform development and identification of potential drug discovery candidates. 
 Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses in the foreseeable future as we continue to manage our existing clinical trials, initiate additional clinical trials for certain product candidates, pursue later stages of clinical development for certain product candidates, maintain our manufacturing capabilities and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates in multiple therapeutic areas. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, share-based compensation and other related benefits costs for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate, legal and administrative functions, as well as compensation-related expenses for our board of directors. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees; expenses associated with being a public company; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; other operating costs; and facility-related expenses. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net is comprised primarily of dividend income and refundable tax credits from tax authorities. We recognize refundable tax credits when there is reasonable assurance that we will comply with the requirements of the refundable tax credit and that the refundable tax credit will be received. 
 Income Taxes 
 We are a Singapore multi-national company subject to taxation in the United States and various other jurisdictions. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial accounting policies and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of the financial statements. Management must apply significant judgment in this process. We believe that our revenue recognition policy, particularly (a) assessing the number of performance obligations; (b) determining the transaction price; (c) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (d) determining the pattern over which performance obligations are satisfied, including estimates to complete performance obligations, and the assumptions and estimates used in our analysis of contracts with CROs and CMOs to estimate the contract expense, involve a greater degree of judgment, and therefore we consider them to be our critical accounting policies. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.

an increase of 9.0 million in other research and development expenses (1) , including INHBE, RNA editing, PRISM, and other internal and external research and development expenses that are not allocated on a program-by-program basis or are related to other discovery and development programs, and the identification of potential drug discovery candidates, mainly due to increases in compensation-related expenses and in other external research and development expenses; and 

a decrease of 2.6 million in external expenses related to our discontinued ALS and FTD program, WVE-004. 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 13.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily driven by increases in compensation related expenses and administrative expenses. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.1 million and 2.1 million, respectively, and consisted primarily of dividend income. 
 Income Tax Benefit (Provision) 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded no income tax benefit or provision. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an income tax benefit of 0.7 million due to a provision to return adjustment in connection with the U.S. tax guidance relating to the capitalization of research and development expenditures. We maintained a full valuation allowance for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in all jurisdictions due to uncertainty regarding future taxable income.

a decrease of 8.5 million in external expenses related to our discontinued ALS and FTD program, WVE-004. 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 42.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 37.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 5.3 million was primarily driven by increases in compensation related expenses and professional fees. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 7.1 million and 7.4 million, respectively, and consisted primarily of dividend income, as well as estimated refundable tax credits. 
 Income Tax Benefit (Provision) 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded no income tax benefit or provision. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an income tax benefit of 0.7 million due to a provision to return adjustment in connection with the U.S. tax guidance relating to the capitalization of research and development expenditures. We maintained a full valuation allowance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in all jurisdictions due to uncertainty regarding future taxable income. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have not generated any product revenue and have incurred recurring net operating losses. To date, we have primarily funded our operations through public and other registered offerings of our ordinary shares and other securities, collaborations with third parties and private placements of debt and equity securities. Through September 30, 2024, we have received an aggregate of approximately 1,544.9 million in net proceeds from these transactions, consisting of 944.3 million in net proceeds from public and other registered offerings of our ordinary shares and other securities, 511.3 million from our collaborations and 89.3 million in net proceeds from private placements of our debt and equity securities. 
 32 

In January 2024, the representatives of the underwriters in connection with the previously disclosed underwritten public offering (the December 2023 Offering exercised their option to purchase an additional 3,000,000 ordinary shares at a price of 5.00 per ordinary share as a part of the December 2023 Offering. We received an additional 14.0 million in net proceeds from the December 2023 Offering in January 2024. 
 On September 27, 2024, the Company closed the September 2024 Offering in which the Company issued and sold 23,125,001 of the Company s ordinary shares and the 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to 1,875,023 of the Company s ordinary shares. The gross proceeds to the Company from the September 2024 Offering were 200.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 310.9 million, restricted cash of 3.7 million and an accumulated deficit of 1,151.1 million. On October 1, 2024, the representatives of the underwriters in connection with the previously disclosed underwritten public offering exercised their option in full to purchase an additional 3,750,000 ordinary shares, for additional net proceeds to us of approximately 28.2 million. 
 We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. We have based this expectation on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, we may elect to raise additional funds before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable due to market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we expect we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. 
 Our operating lease commitments as of September 30, 2024 total approximately 31.4 million, of which approximately 2.3 million is related to payments in 2024 and approximately 29.1 million is related to payments beyond 2024. 
 Until we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to continue to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. In May 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the SEC pursuant to which we registered for sale an indeterminate amount of any combination of our ordinary shares, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine. Our shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR also included a prospectus covering up to an aggregate of 250.0 million in ordinary shares that we could issue and sell from time to time, through Jefferies LLC Jefferies acting as our sales agent, pursuant to the open market sales agreement that we entered into with Jefferies in May 2019, as amended in March 2020 and March 2022 (the Sales Agreement ), for our at-the-market equity program. Since we no longer qualified as a well-known seasoned issuer WKSI at the time of the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, we previously amended the shelf registration statement to register for sale up to 500.0 million of any combination of our ordinary shares, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine, including the 250.0 million in ordinary shares that we may issue and sell from time to time pursuant to our at-the-market equity program. This registration statement, which we refer to as the 2019 Form S-3, remained effective until our 2022 Form S-3 (as defined below) was declared effective on May 4, 2022, after which time we may no longer offer or sell any securities under the 2019 Form S-3. 
 On March 3, 2022, we filed a new universal shelf registration on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on May 4, 2022, pursuant to which we registered for sale up to 500.0 million of any combination of our ordinary shares, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine, which we refer to as the 2022 Form S-3. The 2022 Form S-3 included a prospectus covering up to approximately 132.0 million in ordinary shares that had not yet been issued or sold under our Sales Agreement with Jefferies at the time the 2022 Form S-3 was declared effective. In connection with and to access capacity for the September 2024 Offering, we reduced the amount of ordinary shares that may be sold pursuant to our at-the-market equity offering program with Jefferies to 0. 
 On November 12, 2024, we plan to file a WKSI shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the SEC pursuant to which we expect to register for sale an indeterminate amount of any combination of our ordinary shares, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine, which we refer to as the 2024 WKSI Shelf . Our 2024 WKSI Shelf is expected to include a prospectus covering up to an aggregate of 250.0 million in ordinary shares that we could issue and sell from time to time, through Jefferies LLC Jefferies acting as our sales agent, pursuant to the Open Market Sale Agreement, dated May 10, 2019, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated as of March 2, 2020, Amendment No. 2, dated as of March 3, 2022, and Amendment No. 3 (as defined below) (collectively, the Sales Agreement ), for our at-the-market equity program. As of the filing and automatic effectiveness of our 2024 WKSI Shelf, the 2022 Form S-3 will be deemed terminated. 
 Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and we may never do so.

Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities used 107.4 million of cash, due to our net loss of 126.3 million and offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of 2.5 million and by non-cash charges of 16.4 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, operating activities provided 13.8 million of cash, due to our net loss of 41.3 million, offset by non-cash charges of 14.5 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 40.6 million. The largest non-cash charge was the 7.4 million of share-based compensation. The largest change in operating assets and liabilities was a 62.3 million increase in deferred revenue, mainly driven by our GSK Collaboration Agreement, which became effective in January 2023, which was offset by the second largest change in operating assets and liabilities, the 7.0 million increase in accounts receivable related to the achievement of a milestone under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investing activities used 0.9 million of cash, related to purchases of property and equipment. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, investing activities used 0.8 million of cash, related to purchases of property and equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 218.9 million, which was primarily due to the 188.0 million in net proceeds from the September 2024 Offering of ordinary shares and the 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants; as well as the 14.0 million in net proceeds from the January 2024 exercise of the underwriters option to purchase an additional 3,000,000 shares under the December 2023 Offering. Additionally, we received 15.3 million in net proceeds from sales under our at-the-market equity program. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 38.6 million, which was primarily due to the GSK Equity Investment (as defined in Note 5). 
 Funding Requirements 
 We expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with our ongoing research and development activities and our internal cGMP manufacturing activities. Furthermore, we anticipate that our expenses will continue to vary if and as we: 
 continue to conduct our clinical trials evaluating our product candidates in patients; 

conduct research and preclinical development of discovery targets and advance additional programs into clinical development; 

file clinical trial applications with global regulatory agencies and conduct clinical trials for our programs; 

make strategic investments in continuing to innovate our research and development platform, PRISM, and in optimizing our manufacturing processes and formulations; 

maintain our manufacturing capabilities through our internal facility and our CMOs; 

maintain our intellectual property portfolio and consider the acquisition of complementary intellectual property; 

seek and obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates; 

34 

respond to the impacts of the local and global health epidemics, the conflict involving Russia and Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, global economic uncertainty, rising inflation, rising interest rates or market disruptions on our business; and 

establish and build capabilities to market, distribute and sell our product candidates. 

We may experience delays or encounter issues with any of the above, including but not limited to failed studies, complex results, safety issues or other regulatory challenges. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of drug candidates and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of product candidates is unknown, we are unable to estimate the amounts of future capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development for our therapeutic programs. Our future capital requirements for our therapeutic programs will depend on many factors, including: 
 the progress, results and costs of conducting research and continued preclinical and clinical development for our therapeutic programs and future potential pipeline candidates; 

the number and characteristics of product candidates and programs that we pursue; 

the cost of manufacturing clinical supplies of our product candidates; 

whether and to what extent milestone events are achieved under our collaborations with Takeda and GSK or any potential future licensee or collaborator; 

the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 

our ability to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates; 

the impacts of the local and global health epidemics, the conflict involving Russia and Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, global economic uncertainty, rising inflation, rising interest rates or market disruptions on our business; 

the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; 

market acceptance of our product candidates, to the extent any are approved for commercial sale, and the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; 

the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; 

the effect of competing technological and market developments; and 

the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, including entering into licensing or collaboration arrangements for product candidates. 

Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our product revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives. 
 Adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms when we need them, or at all. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds, except for possible future payments from Takeda or GSK under our collaborations with them. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. Additional debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute our shareholders ownership interests. 
 If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as, to a lesser extent, inflation and capital market risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk in the ordinary course of our business. Our cash and cash equivalents are comprised of funds held in checking accounts and money market accounts. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Due to our operations outside of the United States, we are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Historically, we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and, in some instances, could materially adversely affect our business, our financial conditions, our results of operations or our cash flows. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our historical financial position, our business, our financial condition, our results of operations or our cash flows. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the last two years. If global inflation trends continue, we expect appreciable increases in clinical trial, labor, and other operating costs. 
 Capital Market Risk 
 We currently have no product revenues and depend on funds raised through other sources. One possible source of funding is through further equity offerings. Our ability to raise funds in this manner depends upon capital market forces affecting our share price, including impacts of global economic uncertainty on the capital markets. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
