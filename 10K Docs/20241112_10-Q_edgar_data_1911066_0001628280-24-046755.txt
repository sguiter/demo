FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on our current expectations and estimates, our prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, outlook, potential, predicts and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 our future operating results; 
 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 
 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest;

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or a forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this report. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements, except as otherwise provided by law.

from its effective date, May 28, 2024 and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by the Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and, in each case, a majority of the Independent Trustees. The Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by the Adviser and may be terminated by the Adviser without penalty upon not less than days written notice to the Fund, or by the Fund without penalty upon not less than days written notice to the Adviser. 
 On April 29, 2024, the Fund entered into a management and incentive fee waiver agreement (the Prior Fee Waiver Agreement with Churchill, pursuant to which Churchill has agreed to extend the term of the initial fee waiver under the Prior Advisory Agreement, and (a) waive of the management fee payable to Churchill and (b) waive of the incentive fee based on income payable to Churchill for the period beginning June 1, 2024 until December 31, 2024. In connection with entering into the Advisory Agreement, on May 28, 2024, the Fund entered into a new management and incentive fee waiver agreement (the Fee Waiver Agreement with the Adviser, pursuant to which the Adviser has agreed to continue to waive the management fee and the incentive fee on income pursuant to the same terms and for the same period set forth in the Prior Fee Waiver Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fee Waiver Agreement does not amend the calculation of the management fee or the incentive fee based on income as set forth in the Advisory Agreement. Other than the waiver contemplated by the Fee Waiver Agreement, the terms of the Advisory Agreement will remain in full force and effect. 
 Base Management Fee 
 The management fee is payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of of the value of the Fund s net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month. For the first calendar month in which the Fund has operations, net assets will be measured using the beginning net assets as of the Escrow Break Date. In addition, the Adviser has agreed to waive 100 of its management fee until June 1, 2024, the expiry of twelve months from the Escrow Break Date, and 50 of the management fee for the period from June 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, base management fees earned were and , respectively, out of which and were waived by the Adviser, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, was payable to the Adviser related to management fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, base management fees earned were and , respectively, all of which were voluntarily waived by the Adviser. As of September 30, 2023, amounts were payable to the Adviser related to management fees. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee consists of components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not: (i) incentive fee on income and (ii) an incentive fee on capital gains. Each part of the incentive fee is outlined below. 
 Incentive Fee Based on Income 
 The portion based on income is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Fund receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee and any shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees).

per quarter annualized). 
 The Fund will pay the Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows: 
 No incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized); 
 of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of annualized). The Fund refers to this portion of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than as the catch-up. The catch-up is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 
 of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to the Adviser. 
 These calculations will be pro-rated for any period of less than three months. 
 The Adviser has agreed to waive the incentive fee based on income until December 31, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, income based incentive fees were and , respectively, which were waived by the Adviser. As of September 30, 2024, amounts were payable to the Adviser related to income based incentive fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, income based incentive fees were and , respectively, which were voluntarily waived by the Adviser. As of September 30, 2023, amounts were payable to the Adviser related to income based incentive fees. 
 Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains 
 The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, will be payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. The amount payable will equal: 
 of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Each year, the fee paid for the capital gains incentive fee will be net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for all prior periods. The Fund will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser if the Fund was to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to the Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Advisers Act, including Section 205 thereof. 
 The fees that are payable under the Advisory Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Fund did not incur any incentive fee based on capital gains.

 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 
 The Fund has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which it will reinvest all cash distributions declared by the Board on behalf of its shareholders who do not elect to receive their distributions in cash, except for shareholders in certain states. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and the Fund declares, a cash dividend or other distribution, then shareholders who have not opted out of the Fund s distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional Common Shares, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington investors and clients of certain participating brokers that do not permit automatic enrollment in the distribution reinvestment plan will automatically receive their distributions in cash unless they elect to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional Common Shares. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder s account to three decimal places. 
 Character of Distributions 
 The Fund may fund its cash distributions to shareholders from any source of funds available to the Fund, including but not limited to offering proceeds, net investment income from operations, capital gain proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings, dividends or other distributions paid to it on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and expense support from an affiliate of the Adviser, which is subject to recoupment.

of its Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board, in its sole discretion, may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in the best interest of the Fund s shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Fund s liquidity, adversely affect the Fund s operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Fund that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. Following any such suspension, the Board will consider on at least a quarterly basis whether the continued suspension of the share repurchase program is in the best interest of the Fund and shareholders, and will reinstate the share repurchase program when and if appropriate and subject to its fiduciary duty to the Fund and shareholders. However, the Board is not required to authorize the recommencement of the share repurchase program within any specified period of time. The Fund intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the 1940 Act. All Common Shares purchased by the Fund pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued Common Shares. 
 Under the share repurchase program, to the extent the Fund offers to repurchase Common Shares in any particular quarter, the Fund expects to repurchase Common Shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that Common Shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Fund for the benefit of remaining shareholders. The repurchase of the Adviser s shares, if any, will be on the same terms and subject to the same limitations as other shareholders under the Share Repurchase Program. 
 Payment for repurchased shares may require the Fund to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier than our Adviser would otherwise have caused these holdings to be liquidated, potentially resulting in losses, and may increase the Fund s investment-related expenses as a result of higher portfolio turnover rates. The Adviser intends to take measures, subject to policies as may be established by the Board, to attempt to avoid or minimize potential losses and expenses resulting from the repurchase of shares. Class I shares owned by TIAA will be subject to the following restrictions. TIAA may submit its Class I shares for repurchase beginning on March 31, 2027. Beginning March 31, 2027, the total amount of TIAA shares eligible for repurchase will be limited to no more than of the Fund s aggregate NAV per calendar quarter; provided that, if in any quarter the total amount of aggregate repurchase requests of all classes of Common Shares does not exceed the Share Repurchase Plan limit of of the aggregate NAV per calendar quarter, these redemption limits on the TIAA shares will not apply for that quarter, and TIAA will be entitled to submit its shares for repurchase up to the overall share repurchase program limits. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately Class I shares were repurchased. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Common Shares were repurchased.

ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The information in this section contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or the future performance or financial condition of Nuveen Churchill Private Capital Income Fund, including its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, "we", "us", "our", or the "Fund") and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in any forward-looking statements. 
 Overview 
 We were formed as a Delaware statutory trust on February 8, 2022. We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). 
 Our investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns primarily through current income and, secondarily, long-term capital appreciation, by investing in a diversified portfolio of private debt and equity investments in U.S. middle market companies owned by leading private equity firms, which we define as companies with 10 million to 250 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ). We primarily focus on investing in U.S. middle market companies with 10 million to 100 million of EBITDA, which we consider the core middle market. 
 We primarily invest in first-lien senior secured debt and first-out positions in unitranche loans (collectively Senior Loan Investments ), as well as junior debt investments, such as second-lien loans, unsecured debt, subordinated debt and last-out positions in unitranche loans (including fixed- and floating-rate instruments and instruments with payment-in-kind income) Junior Capital Investments ). Senior Loan Investments and Junior Capital Investments may be originated alongside smaller related common equity positions to the same portfolio companies. Our portfolio also will include larger, stand-alone direct equity co-investments in private-equity backed companies that may or may not be originated alongside or separately from Senior Loan Investments and/or Junior Capital Investments to the applicable portfolio company Equity Co-Investments ). We target an investment portfolio consisting, directly or indirectly, of 75 to 90 in Senior Loan Investments, 5 to 25 in Junior Capital Investments and up to 10 in Equity Co-Investments. To support our share repurchase program, we will also invest 5 to 10 of our assets in cash and cash equivalents, liquid fixed-income securities (including broadly syndicated loans) and other liquid credit instruments Liquid Investments ). While we seek to achieve the targets described above, the composition of the Fund s investment portfolio may vary from time to time due to various factors, such as market conditions and the availability of attractive investment opportunities.

 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity varies substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount we have available to invest as well as the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity in the middle market, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make, and other market conditions. 
 To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. To the extent we qualify as a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S federal income tax on any income we timely distribute to our shareholders. 
 As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we are generally required to invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets, including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. 
 As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Under the 1940 Act, the term eligible portfolio company includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than 250.0 million. We also must be organized in the United States to qualify as a BDC. 
 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on our Senior Loan Investments, our Junior Capital Investments and our Liquid Investments, and capital gains and dividend income from our Equity Co-Investments in our portfolio companies. Our Senior Loan Investments typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). Our Junior Capital Investments generally include cash paying subordinated debt (including fixed-rate subordinated loans, which may have a portion of PIK income, and floating-rate second-lien term loans), subordinated PIK notes (with no current cash payments) and/or equity securities (with no current cash payments). Our Liquid Investments includes a portfolio of cash and cash equivalents, liquid fixed-income securities (including broadly syndicated loans) and other liquid credit instruments. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at the maturity date. Original Issue discounts and market discounts or premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. 
 Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. In addition, we generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, and possibly consulting fees.

 Churchill, Nuveen Asset Management and their affiliates are responsible for the compensation and routine overhead expenses allocable to personnel providing investment advisory and management services to the Fund.

 The weighted average yields of our investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Weighted average yield on debt and income producing investments, at cost (1) 
 10.05 11.33 Weighted average yield on debt and income producing investments, at fair value (1) 
 10.12 11.44 Percentage of debt investments bearing a floating rate 92.32 84.74 Percentage of debt investments bearing a fixed rate 7.68 15.26 
 _______________ 
 (1) There were no investments on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 68.57 and 68.54 of our debt and income producing investments at cost and at fair value, respectively, had interest rate floors that limit the minimum applicable interest rates on such loans. As of December 31, 2023, 73.75 and 73.86 of our debt and income producing investments at cost and at fair value, respectively, had interest rate floors that limit the minimum applicable interest rates on such loans. 
 79 

The weighted average yield of our debt and income producing securities is not the same as a return on investment for our shareholders, but rather relates to our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiary s fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates as of each respective date, including accretion of original issue discount, but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level. Total weighted average yields of our debt and income producing investments, at cost, decreased from 11.33 to 10.05 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The decrease in weighted average yields was primarily due to the tightening of spreads in newly originated investments made year to date in 2024. We also saw an increase in repricing transactions for existing portfolio investments in the first three quarters of 2024. 
 As financial markets stabilize and private equity firms become more active in an effort to deploy dry powder and return capital to their investors we are seeing private equity mergers and acquisitions ("M A") volumes increase, leading to higher levels of demand for middle-market financings. Prepayment activity is also increasing as a result, driven primarily by M A activity, but also in part by repricing and refinancing while spreads continue to tighten. While prepayments serve as an offset to new transaction activity, we believe that lenders who are well positioned with available liquidity as well as incumbent positions in portfolio companies will benefit from increased levels of activity in the market. 
 Keeping the macro-economic environment in mind, we are closely monitoring the impacts to our portfolio companies, and we will continue to seek to invest in defensive businesses with low levels of cyclicality and strong levels of free cash flow generation. While we are not seeing signs of a broad-based deterioration in our performance or that of our portfolio companies at this time, there can be no assurance that the performance of certain of our portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by economic conditions, which could have a negative impact on our future results. 
 
 Asset Quality 
 In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, we use the Adviser s investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio, with the exception of the Liquid Investments managed by the leveraged finance division of Nuveen Asset Management. Each Investment Team intends to utilize a systematic, consistent approach to credit evaluation, with a particular focus on an acceptable level of debt repayment and deleveraging under a base case set of projections (the Base Case ), which reflects a more conservative estimate than the set of projections provided by a prospective portfolio company (the Management Case ). The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 
 1. Performing - Superior: Borrower is performing significantly above Management Case. 
 2. Performing - High: Borrower is performing at or near the Management Case (i.e., in a range slightly below to slightly above). 
 3. Performing - Low Risk: Borrower is operating well ahead of the Base Case to slightly below the Management Case. 
 4. Performing - Stable Risk: Borrower is operating at or near the Base Case (i.e., in a range slightly below to slightly above). This is the initial rating assigned to all new borrowers. 
 5. Performing - Management Notice: Borrower is operating below the Base Case. Adverse trends in business conditions and/or industry outlook are viewed as temporary. There is no immediate risk of payment default and only a low to moderate risk of covenant default. 
 6. Watch List - Low Maintenance: Borrower is operating below the Base Case, with declining margin of protection. Adverse trends in business conditions and/or industry outlook are viewed as probably lasting for more than a year. Payment default is still considered unlikely, but there is a moderate to high risk of covenant default. 
 7. Watch List - Medium Maintenance: Borrower is operating well below the Base Case, but has adequate liquidity. Adverse trends are more pronounced than in Internal Risk Rating 6 above. There is a high risk of covenant default, or it may have already occurred. Payments are current, although subject to greater uncertainty, and there is a moderate to high risk of payment default. 
 8. Watch List - High Maintenance: Borrower is operating well below the Base Case. Liquidity may be strained. Covenant default is imminent or may have occurred. Payments are current, but there is a high risk of payment default. Negotiations to restructure or refinance debt on normal terms may have begun. Further significant deterioration appears unlikely and no loss of principal is currently anticipated. 
 9. Watch List - Possible Loss: At the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay or refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Liquidity is strained. Payment default may have occurred or is very likely in the short term unless creditors grant some relief. Loss of principal is possible. 
 80 

10. Watch List - Probable Loss: At the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay or refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Payment default is very likely or may have already occurred. Liquidity is extremely limited. The prospects for improvement in the borrower s situation are sufficiently negative that loss of some or all principal is probable. 
 The Adviser regularly monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment rating assigned to each investment in our portfolio, excluding Liquid Investments managed by the leveraged finance division of Nuveen Asset Management. Each investment team will review the investment ratings in connection with monthly or quarterly portfolio reviews. Based on a generally uncertain economic outlook in the United States (which includes a possible recession), we have increased oversight and analysis of credits in any vulnerable industries to mitigate any decline in loan performance and reduce credit risk. 
 The following table shows the investment ratings of the investments in our portfolio (dollar amounts in thousands):

 (1) Liquid Investments managed by the leveraged finance division of Nuveen Asset Management are excluded from the investment ratings table. As of September 30, 2024, there were 78 portfolio companies in the Liquid Investments portfolio, which had a total fair value of 193,399 or 17.47 of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, there were 50 portfolio companies in the Liquid Investments portfolio, which had a total fair value of 44,104 or 8.61 of the portfolio. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average Internal Risk Rating of our investment portfolio was 4.0 and 4.1, respectively.

Investment Income 
 On March 31, 2022, prior to the Fund s election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, TIAA contributed certain portfolio investments to the Fund and SPV I. The Fund accrued investment income on this portfolio beginning April 1, 2022. 
 Investment income increased to 28.2 million and 64.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 12.2 million and 33.6 million for the comparable period in the prior year, respectively, primarily due to increased investment activities driven by an increase in our deployed capital, slightly offset by a decrease in the weighted average yield of our debt and income producing investments as a result of market spread tightening and a decline in SOFR. As of September 30, 2024, the size of our portfolio increased to 1,113.4 million from 451.2 million, as of September 30, 2023, at cost. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average yield of our debt and income producing investments decreased to 10.05 from 11.49 as of September 30, 2023, at cost, primarily due to overall tightening of spreads in newly originated investments, the refinancing and repricing of existing portfolio companies, and the decline in base interest rates. The shifting environment in base interest rates, such as SOFR and alternate rates, may affect our investment income over the long term. We expect our portfolio will continue to grow as we raise and deploy capital through our offering and our investment income to grow commensurately.

 Total expenses before expense support and waived fees increased to 11.5 million and 23.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 5.4 million and 12.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily due to the accrual of the management fee and the income based incentive fee following the Escrow Break Date. Our Adviser agreed to waive 100 of the management fee until June 1, 2024, the expiry of twelve months from the Escrow Break Date, and 50 of the management fee for the period from June 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. Our Adviser also agreed to waive the income based incentive fee until December 31, 2024. 
 Interest and debt financing expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher average daily borrowings. The average daily borrowings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 302.7 million and 168.2 million, respectively, compared to 128.2 million and 133.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The average interest rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.29 and 7.75 , respectively, compared to 8.02 and 7.57 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The expense support amount represents the amount of expenses paid on our behalf in accordance with the Expense Support Agreement. These expenses are subject to reimbursement by us in accordance with the terms of the Expense Support Agreement. 
 Net realized gain (loss) and Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments 
 We had a net realized gain on investments of 297 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by full or partial repayments and sales of certain of our investments compared to a net realized gain of 67 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net realized gain on investments of 442 thousand primarily driven by full or partial repayments and sales of certain of our investments compared to a net realized gain of 685 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We recorded a net change in unrealized loss of (0.3) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net unrealized gain of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which reflects the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio relative to its cost basis over the period. We recorded a net change in unrealized loss of (2.0) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net unrealized loss of (2.0) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which reflects the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio relative to its cost basis over the period. The net change in unrealized loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to modest softening of certain of our portfolio companies credit metrics offset by tightening in market spreads. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We expect to generate cash primarily from (i) the net proceeds of our offering of Common Shares, (ii) cash flows from income earned from our investments and principal repayments, (iii) proceeds from net borrowings on our Bank of America Credit Facility and CLO debt issuances (discussed further below) and (iv) any future offerings of our equity or debt securities. 
 Our primary uses of cash will be for (i) investments in portfolio companies in accordance with investment objective and investment strategies and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying the 
 84 

Adviser and the Administrator), (iii) cost of any borrowings under our Bank of America Credit Facility or other financing arrangements, (iv) funding repurchases under our share repurchase program, and (v) cash distributions to the holders of our Common Shares. Due to an uncertain economic outlook and current market volatility, we regularly evaluate our overall liquidity position and take proactive steps to maintain that position based on such circumstances. 
 Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, taken together with our available debt, are expected to be sufficient for our investment activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of September 30, 2024, we had 182.4 million available borrowings under our Bank of America Credit Facility. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by 23.4 million. During that period, 531.9 million was used in operating activities, primarily due to investment purchases of 734.0 million, offset by 141.2 million in repayments and sales of investments in portfolio companies. During the same period, 555.3 million was provided by financing activities, consisting primarily of proceeds from issuance of Common Shares and issuance of secured borrowings of 407.6 million and 702.6 million, respectively, offset by repayments of secured borrowings of 519.9 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by 59.4 million. During that period, 44.3 million was used in operating activities, primarily due to investment purchases of 120.3 million, offset by 24.9 million in repayments and sales of investments in portfolio companies. During the same period, 15.1 million was used in financing activities, consisting primarily of proceeds from secured borrowings of 54.3 million, and repayments of secured borrowings of 88.5 million. 
 Net Worth of Sponsors 
 The North American Securities Administrators Association NASAA ), in its Omnibus Guidelines Statement of Policy adopted on March 29, 1992 and as amended on May 7, 2007 and from time to time (the Omnibus Guidelines ), requires that our affiliates and Adviser, or our Sponsor, as defined under the Omnibus Guidelines, have an aggregate financial net worth, exclusive of home, automobiles and home furnishings, of the greater of either 100,000, or 5.0 of the first 20 million of both the gross amount of securities currently being offered in our offering and the gross amount of any originally issued direct participation program securities sold by our affiliates and sponsors within the past 12 months, plus 1.0 of all amounts in excess of the first 20 million. Based on these requirements, our Adviser and its affiliates, while not liable directly or indirectly for any indebtedness we may incur, have an aggregate financial net worth in excess of those amounts required by the Omnibus Guidelines Statement of Policy. 
 Equity 
 The Fund is authorized to issue an unlimited number of Common Shares. On March 30, 2022, we issued an initial 40 Class I shares to TIAA in connection with our formation. On March 31, 2022, TIAA contributed certain portfolio investments to the Fund in the amount of 296,231 (fair value as of March 31, 2022). In connection therewith, the Fund entered into the Note with TIAA as the lender (as described in Note 5 ), and issued to TIAA shares of the Fund s Class I shares of beneficial interest. The Fund fully repaid the balance of the Note to TIAA on June 3, 2022. As of September 30, 2024, TIAA owned 5,929,059 shares of the Fund s Class I shares of beneficial interest. 
 As of June 1, 2023 (the Escrow Break Date ), the Fund had satisifed the minimum offering requirement and the Board authorized the release of proceeds from escrow.

 The Fund determines NAV for each class of Common Shares as of the last day of each calendar month. Share issuances related to monthly subscriptions are effective the first calendar day of each month. Shares are issued at an offering price equivalent to the most recent NAV per share available for each share class, which will be the prior calendar day NAV per share (i.e. the prior month-end NAV). The following table presents each month-end NAV per share for Class S, Class D, and Class I common shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 The Fund has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which it will reinvest all cash distributions declared by the Board on behalf of its shareholders who do not elect to receive their distributions in cash, except for shareholders in certain states. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then our shareholders who have not opted out of our distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional Common Shares, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington investors and clients of certain participating brokers that do not permit automatic enrollment in our distribution reinvestment plan will automatically receive their distributions in cash unless they elect to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional Common Shares. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder s account to three decimal places. 
 88 

Share Repurchase Program 
 Beginning with the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Fund commenced a share repurchase program in which it intends to repurchase in each quarter, at the discretion of the Board, up to 5 of its Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board, in its sole discretion, may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in the best interest of the Fund s shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect the Fund s operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Fund that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. Following any such suspension, the Board will consider on at least a quarterly basis whether the continued suspension of the share repurchase program is in the best interest of the Fund and shareholders, and will reinstate the share repurchase program when and if appropriate and subject to its fiduciary duty to the Fund and shareholders. However, our Board is not required to authorize the recommencement of our share repurchase program within any specified period of time. The Fund intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All Common Shares purchased by the Fund pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued. 
 Under the share repurchase program, to the extent the Fund offers to repurchase Common Shares in any particular quarter, the Fund expects to repurchase Common Shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that Common Shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Fund for the benefit of remaining shareholders. The repurchase of the Adviser s shares, if any, will be on the same terms and subject to the same limitations as other shareholders under the share repurchase program. 
 Payment for repurchased shares may require us to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier than our Adviser would otherwise have caused these holdings to be liquidated, potentially resulting in losses, and may increase our investment-related expenses as a result of higher portfolio turnover rates. Our Adviser intends to take measures, subject to policies as may be established by our Board, to attempt to avoid or minimize potential losses and expenses resulting from the repurchase of shares. Class I shares owned by TIAA will be subject to the following restrictions. TIAA may submit its Class I shares for repurchase beginning on March 31, 2027. Beginning March 31, 2027, the total amount of TIAA shares eligible for repurchase will be limited to no more than 1.67 of our aggregate NAV per calendar quarter; provided that, if in any quarter the total amount of aggregate repurchase requests of all classes of Common Shares does not exceed the share repurchase program limit of 5 of the aggregate NAV per calendar quarter, these redemption limits on the TIAA shares will not apply for that quarter, and TIAA will be entitled to submit its shares for repurchase up to the overall share repurchase program limits. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 40,238 Class I Common Shares were repurchased. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, no Common Shares were repurchased. 
 The following table presents the share repurchases completed for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands, except share and per share data):

 Income Taxes 
 
 The Fund has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The Fund also intends to qualify annually to be treated as a RIC under the Code. So long as the Fund maintains its RIC tax treatment, it generally will not be subject to U.S federal income tax on any ordinary income or capital gains that it timely distributes to its shareholders as dividends. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Fund would represent obligations of the Fund s investors and would not be reflected in the financial statements of the Fund. 
 89 

The Fund evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. 
 To qualify for and maintain qualification as a RIC, the Fund must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment, the Fund must distribute to its shareholders, for each taxable year, at least the sum of (i) 90 of its investment company taxable income for that year (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), which is generally its ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of its realized net short-term capital gains over its realized net long-term capital losses and (ii) 90 of its net tax-exempt income. 
 In addition, based on the excise tax distribution requirements, the Fund is subject to a 4 nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on undistributed income unless the Fund distributes in a timely manner in each taxable year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of its ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in prior years. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Fund that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. 
 
 Secured Borrowings 
 See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on our secured borrowings. 
 Bank of America Credit Facility 
 
 On April 19, 2022, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Fund entered into a credit agreement with the lenders from time to time parties thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, the Fund, as servicer, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as collateral administrator, and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral custodian (the Bank of America Credit Facility Agreement and the revolving credit facility thereunder, the Bank of America Credit Facility ). The Bank of America Credit Facility was amended on October 4, 2022, March 21, 2023, July 16, 2024 and September 19, 2024. The most recent amendment on September 19, 2024, among other things: (i) increased the maximum amount available from 150.0 million to 250.0 million and provides for a further increase to 350.0 million on or about March 19. 2025; (ii) extends the availability period to September 19, 2027; and (iii) extends the maturity date to September 19, 2029. 
 Borrowings under the Bank of America Credit Facility bear interest based on either (x) an annual rate equal to SOFR determined for any day Daily SOFR for the relevant interest period, plus an applicable spread, or (y) the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus an applicable spread, (ii) the Prime Rate in effect for any day and (iii) Daily SOFR plus an applicable spread. Interest is payable monthly in arrears. Advances under the Bank of America Credit Facility are secured by a pool of broadly-syndicated and middle-market loans subject to eligibility criteria and advance rates specified in the Bank of America Credit Facility Agreement. Advances under the Bank of America Credit Facility may be prepaid and reborrowed at any time during the Availability Period (as defined therein), but any termination or reduction of the facility amount is subject to certain conditions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank of America Credit Facility bears interest at a rate of Daily SOFR plus 1.93 per annum. Interest is payable monthly in arrears. 
 
 On July 16, 2024, SPV II entered into the borrower joinder agreement to become party to the Bank of America Credit Facility Agreement and pledged all of its assets to the collateral agent to secure their obligations under the Bank of America Credit Facility. The Fund and SPV II have made customary representations and warranties and are required to comply with various financial covenants related to liquidity and other maintenance covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar facilities.

CLO-I 
 On July 16, 2024 (the Closing Date ), the Fund completed a 398.7 million term debt securitization (the 2024 Debt Securitization ). The term debt securitization is also known as a collateralized loan obligation and is a form of secured financing incurred by the Fund. 
 The notes offered in the 2024 Debt Securitization (the 2024 Notes were issued by CLO-I (formerly known as SPV I) (the 2024 Issuer ), a direct, wholly owned, consolidated subsidiary of the Fund, pursuant to an indenture and security agreement, dated as of the Closing Date (the Indenture ). The 2024 Debt consists of 197.0 million of AAA Class A 2024 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month Term SOFR plus 1.70 ; 48.0 million of AA Class B 2024 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month Term SOFR plus 1.95 ; 26.0 million of A Class C 2024 Notes, which bear interest at the three-month Term SOFR plus 2.55 ; and 92.7 million of Subordinated 2024 Notes, which do not bear interest. The Fund directly owns all of the Subordinated 2024 Notes and as such, these notes are eliminated in consolidation. 
 As part of the 2024 Debt Securitization, CLO-I also entered into a loan agreement (the CLO-I Loan Agreement on the Closing Date, pursuant to which various financial institutions and other persons which are, or may become, parties to the CLO-I Loan Agreement as lenders (the Lenders committed to make 35.0 million of AAA Class A-L 2024 Loans to CLO-I (the 2024 Loans and, together with the 2024 Notes, the 2024 Debt ). The 2024 Loans bear interest at the three-month Term SOFR plus 1.70 (the 2024 Class A-L Loans and were fully drawn upon the closing of the transaction. Any lender may elect to convert all of the Class A-L 2024 Loans held by such Lenders into Class A 2024 Notes upon written notice to CLO-I in accordance with the CLO-I Loan Agreement. 
 The 2024 Debt is backed by a diversified portfolio of senior secured and second lien loans. Each of the Indenture and the CLO-I Loan Agreement contain certain conditions pursuant to which loans can be acquired by the 2024 Issuer, in accordance with rating agency criteria or as otherwise agreed with certain institutional investors who purchased the 2024 Debt. Through July 20, 2028, all principal collections received on the underlying collateral may be used by the 2024 Issuer to purchase new collateral under the direction of its collateral manager and in accordance with the Fund s investment strategy, allowing the Fund to maintain the initial leverage in the 2024 Debt Securitization. The 2024 Notes are due on July 20, 2036 and the 2024 Loans mature on July 20, 2036. 
 The Fund serves as collateral manager to the 2024 Issuer under a collateral management agreement and waives any management fee due to it in consideration for providing these services.

 Related-Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 
 the Advisory Agreement; 
 the Sub-Advisory Agreements; 
 the Administration Agreement; and 
 the Expense Support Agreement. 
 In addition to the aforementioned agreements, the SEC has granted an exemptive order (the Order that permits us to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions with certain other funds and accounts sponsored or managed by either of the 
 91 

Adviser and/or their affiliates. Co-investment under the Order is subject to certain conditions therein, including the condition that, in the case of each co-investment transaction, the Board determines that it would be in the Fund s best interest to participate in the transaction. Neither we nor the affiliated funds are obligated to invest or co-invest when investment opportunities are referred to us or them. 
 In addition, pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC on April 8, 2020 and applicable to all BDCs through December 31, 2020 (the Temporary Relief ), BDCs were permitted, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to complete follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company. Without the Temporary Relief, such private funds would not be able to participate in such follow-on investments unless the private funds had previously acquired securities of the portfolio company in a co-investment transaction with the BDC. Although the Temporary Relief expired on December 31, 2020, the SEC s Division of Investment Management had indicated that until March 31, 2022, it would not recommend enforcement action, to the extent that any BDC with an existing co-investment order continues to engage in certain transactions described in the Temporary Relief, pursuant to the same terms and conditions described therein. The conditional exemptive order is no longer effective; however, on October 14, 2022, the SEC granted the Fund s request to amend the Order to make the Temporary Relief permanent for the Fund and permit the Fund to complete follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds do not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company. 
 Expense Support Agreement 
 We have entered into the Expense Support Agreement with Churchill. The Expense Support Agreement provides that, at such times as it determines, Nuveen Alternative Holdings may pay (or cause one or more of its affiliates to pay) certain expenses of the Fund, including organization and offering expenses, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest expense and/or shareholder servicing fees of the Fund (each, an Expense Payment ). Such Expense Payment will be made in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than forty-five days after a written commitment from Nuveen Alternative Holdings to pay such expense, and/or by an offset against amounts due from us to Nuveen Alternative Holdings. 
 Following any calendar month in which Available Operating Funds (as defined below) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to our shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar month (such amount referred to as the Excess Operating Funds ), we will pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof (each, a Reimbursement Payment ), to Nuveen Alternative Holdings that previously paid such expenses, until such time as all Expense Payments made by such entity within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter have been reimbursed. Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) net investment income (including net realized short-term capital gains reduced by net realized long-term capital losses), (ii) net capital gains (including the excess of net realized long-term capital gains over net realized short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid to us on account of investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above). The amount of the Reimbursement Payment for any calendar month will equal the lesser of (i) the Excess Operating Funds in such quarter and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Expense Payments made by Nuveen Alternative Holdings to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter that have not been previously reimbursed by us to Nuveen Alternative Holdings. 
 The Expense Support Agreement provides additional restrictions on the amount of each Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter and no Reimbursement Payment will be made for any month if: (1) the annualized rate (based on a 365-day year) of regular cash distributions per share of beneficial interest declared by our Board exclusive of returns of capital, distribution rate reductions due to any fees (including to a transfer agent) payable in connection with distributions, and any declared special dividends or distributions (the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share declared by us at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is less than the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates, or (2) our Operating Expense Ratio (as defined below) at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is greater than the Operating Expense Ratio at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates. The Operating Expense Ratio is calculated by dividing Operating Expenses (as defined below), less organizational and offering expenses, base management and incentive fees owed to the Adviser, and interest expense, by our net assets. Operating Expenses means all of our operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). Nuveen Alternative Holdings may waive its right to receive all or a portion of any Reimbursement Payment in any particular calendar quarter, so that such Reimbursement Payment may be reimbursable in a future calendar quarter within three years of the date of the applicable Expense Payment. 
 The Fund s obligation to make a Reimbursement Payment will automatically become a liability of the Fund on the last business day of the applicable calendar month, except to the extent Churchill has waived the right to receive such payment for the applicable month.

 __________ 
 (1) The effective rate of distribution per share is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount as of the end of the applicable period (which is calculated by annualizing the regular monthly cash distributions per share as of such date without compounding), divided by the Fund s gross offering price per share as of each quarter ended. 
 (2) The operating expense ratio is calculated by dividing the quarterly operating expenses, less organizational and offering expenses, base management fee and incentive fees owed to Churchill, and interest expense, by the Fund s net assets as of each quarter end. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the ordinary course of its business, the Fund enters into contracts or agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could occur which may give rise to liabilities arising from these provisions against us. We believe that the likelihood of such an event is remote; however, the maximum potential exposure is unknown. No accrual has been made in the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We may in the future become obligated to fund commitments such as delayed draw commitments, revolvers, and equity investment commitments. 
 For more information on our off-balance sheet arrangements, commitments and contingencies see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies and estimates, including those relating to the valuation of our portfolio investments, are described below. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Valuation of Portfolio Investments, Revenue Recognition, and U.S. Federal Income Taxes, which are described below. The valuation of investments is our most significant critical accounting estimate. The critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Valuation of Portfolio investments 
 Consistent with U.S. GAAP and the 1940 Act, we conduct a valuation of our assets, pursuant to which our net asset value is determined. 
 Our assets are valued on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board has designated the Adviser as the Fund's valuation designee (the Valuation Designee to determine the fair value of the Fund's investments that do not have readily available market quotations, which became effective beginning with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023. Pursuant to the Fund's valuation policy approved by the Board, a valuation committee comprised of employees of the Adviser (the Valuation Committee is responsible for determining the fair value of the Fund's assets for which market quotations are not readily available, subject to the oversight of the Board. 
 93 

Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. Market quotations are obtained from independent pricing services, where available. Generally investments marked in this manner will be marked at the mean of the bid and ask of the quotes obtained. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we or an independent third-party valuation firm engaged by the Valuation Designee, will take into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including and in combination of: comparison to publicly traded securities, including factors such as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality; the enterprise value of a portfolio company; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows; and the markets in which the portfolio company does business. Investment performance data utilized are the most recently available financial statements and compliance certificates received from the portfolio companies as of the measurement date which in many cases may reflect a lag in information. The independent third-party valuation firm provides a fair valuation report, a description of the methodology used to determine the fair value and their analysis and calculations to support their conclusion. 
 When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation. 
 U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which ranks the level of observability of market price inputs used in measuring investments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment and state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Investments with readily available quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value. We review pricing and methodologies in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. 
 Our accounting policy on the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations, on the consolidated financial statements. 
 For more information on the fair value hierarchy, our framework for determining fair value and the composition of our portfolio see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Our revenue recognition policies are as follows: 
 Net realized gains (losses) on investments : Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method 
 Investment Income : Interest income, including amortization of premium and accretion of discount on loans are recorded on the accrual basis. We accrue interest income based on the effective yield if we expect that, ultimately, we will be able to collect such income. We may have loans in our portfolio that contain payment-in-kind PIK income provisions. PIK represents interest that is accrued and recorded as interest income at the contractual rates, increases the loan principal on the respective capitalization dates, and is generally due at maturity. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. 
 Other income may include income such as consent, waiver, amendment, unused, and prepayment fees associated with our investment activities as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered by us to our portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered. 
 Non-accrual : Generally, if a payment default occurs on a loan in the portfolio, or if management otherwise believes that the issuer of the loan will not be able to make contractual interest payments or principal payments, Churchill will place the loan on non-accrual status and we will cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal and interest is current through payment or until a restructuring occurs, such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible even though we remain contractually entitled to this interest. We may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. 
 94 

Accrued interest is written off when it becomes probable that the interest will not be collected and the amount of uncollectible interest can be reasonably estimated. 
 U.S. Federal Income Taxes 
 We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated as a RIC under the Code. So long as we maintain our qualification as a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute at least annually to our shareholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our shareholders and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 
 We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. 
 Our accounting policy on income taxes is critical because if we are unable to maintain our status as a RIC, we would be required to record a provision for U.S. federal income taxes which may be significant to our financial results. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Adviser to provide us with investment advisory services and the Administration Agreement with the Administrator to provide us with administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the Advisory Agreement and reimbursements under the Administration Agreement. 
 We entered into the Bank of America Credit Facility and intend to establish additional credit facilities or enter into other financing arrangements in the future to facilitate investments and the timely payment of our expenses. It is anticipated that any such credit facilities will bear interest at floating rates at to-be-determined spreads, such as SOFR. We cannot assure shareholders that we will be able to enter into a credit facility on favorable terms or at all. In connection with a credit facility or other borrowings, lenders may require us to pledge assets, commitments and/or drawdowns (and the ability to enforce the payment thereof) and may ask to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. 
 Promissory Note 
 On March 31, 2022, we entered into a promissory note (the Note with TIAA as the lender. The Note is issued under the Purchase and Sales Agreement dated as of March 31, 2022, by and among the Fund, SPV I and TIAA in connection with the contribution of portfolio investments by TIAA to the Fund and SPV I. The principal amount of the Note equals (i) the fair value of portfolio investments contributed as of March 31, 2022, minus (ii) 263.5 million. The Note was due to mature on March 30, 2023, with an interest rate of 4 per annum on the unpaid principal amount, compounded quarterly. 
 On June 3, 2022, the Fund fully repaid the balance on the Note to TIAA which was comprised of 32.7 million and 0.2 million of principal and interest, respectively. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 Distributions 
 On October 28, 2024, the Fund declared regular distributions for each class of its Common Shares in the amounts per share set forth below. The distributions for each class of Common Shares are payable on November 26, 2024 to shareholders of record as of October 31, 2024. 
 Gross Distribution Shareholder Servicing Fee Net Distribution Class I Common Shares 0.200 0.200 Class S Common Shares 0.200 0.017 0.183 Class D Common Shares 0.200 0.005 0.195 
 95 

Subscriptions 
 The Fund received approximately 22.6 million in net proceeds, inclusive of distribution reinvested through the Fund s distribution reinvestment plan, relating to the issuance of Class I shares, Class S shares, and Class D shares as of November 8, 2024. 
 Purchase and Sale Agreement 
 On October 23, 2024, the Fund entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the Purchase Agreement with its affiliate, Nuveen Churchill Private Credit Fund NCPCF ), in accordance with Rule 17a-8 under the 1940 Act. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, NCPCF will sell to the Fund substantially all of its assets, and the Fund will assume NCPCF s liabilities, for total consideration equal to NCPCF s net asset value as of the Determination Date (as defined below). 
 Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, as of a mutually agreed date no earlier than 48 hours prior to the effective time of the transaction, (the Determination Date ), NCPCF will deliver to the Fund a calculation of its net asset value as of such date (the Closing NAV ). Based on such calculations, at the effective time of the transaction, the Fund will deliver to NCPCF cash consideration in an amount equal to the Closing NAV, and NCPCF will sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver to the Fund all of its assets (other than assets necessary for NCPCF to carry out its wind-down and liquidation), and the Fund will assume NCPCF s liabilities, including all indebtedness outstanding under NCPCF s credit facility and all obligations under the documents governing NCPCF s portfolio assets. As soon as reasonably practicable following the closing of the transaction, NCPCF will cease its investment operations and distribute the cash consideration it receives from the transaction and all of its remaining assets, if any, to its shareholders, among other actions necessary for the successful wind down, liquidation, and termination of NCPCF s existence. 
 Closing of the transaction, which is currently anticipated to occur during the fourth quarter of 2024, is subject to certain closing conditions, including requisite approval by NCPCF s shareholders and certain other closing conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement also contains certain termination rights in favor of the Fund and NCPCF, including if the transaction is not completed by December 31, 2024. 
 Amendment No. 2 to Administration Agreement 
 On October 30, 2024, the Board, including all of the trustees who are not interested persons of the Fund (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) (the Independent Trustees ), approved Amendment No. 2 (the Administration Agreement Amendment to the Administration Agreement by and between the Fund and the Administrator. The Fund and the Administrator entered into the Administration Agreement Amendment as a result of comments issued by a state securities regulator in connection with its blue sky review of the Fund s offering. The Administration Agreement Amendment (i) clarifies that certain expenses of the Administrator that are not allocable to the Fund are not reimbursable by the Fund to the Administrator and (ii) provides that the Administrator will not be entitled to indemnification for any loss or liability to the Fund or its shareholders unless certain conditions set forth in the NASAA Omnibus Guidelines Statement of Policy adopted on March 29, 1992 and as amended on May 7, 2007 and from time to time (the Omnibus Guidelines are satisfied, including that the loss or liability was not the result of negligence or misconduct. 
 
 Sixth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust 
 
 On October 30, 2024, the Board, including all of the Independent Trustees, approved an amendment and restatement of the Fund s Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust (the Sixth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust ). The Fund adopted the Sixth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust as a result of comments issued by a state securities regulator in connection with its blue sky review of the Fund s offering. Consistent with the Administration Agreement Amendment, the Sixth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust clarifies that certain expenses of the Administrator that are not allocable to the Fund are not reimbursable by the Fund in order to conform with the Omnibus Guidelines. The Sixth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust became effective immediately.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Uncertainty with respect to, among other things, elevated interest rates, inflationary pressures, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the ongoing war in the Middle East, and the failure of major financial institutions introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effects of this volatility has materially impacted and could continue to materially impact our market risks, including those listed below. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments do not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, as the Valuation Designee, in accordance with our valuation policy subject to the oversight of the Board and, based on, among other things, the input of the independent third-party valuation firms engaged by the Valuation Designee. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing internals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Our net investment income is also affected by fluctuations in various interest rates, including the replacement of LIBOR with alternate rates and prime rates, to the extent our debt investments include floating interest rates. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 On September 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in four years by 0.50 , bringing it to the 4.75 to 5.00 range. Although, the Federal Reserve has signaled in favor of cutting its benchmark rates again in the fourth quarter of 2024 they still remain focused on mitigating inflationary pressures, and there can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will continue to make downward adjustments to the federal funds rate in the future. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will not make upward adjustments to the federal funds rate in the future. In a high interest rate environment, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. It is possible that the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle could result the United States into a recession, which would likely decrease interest rates. A prolonged reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in base rates, such as SOFR or other alternate rates, are not offset by corresponding increases in the spread over such base rate that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses, or a decrease in the interest rate associated with our borrowings. 
 As of September 30, 2024, on a fair value basis, approximately 7.68 of our debt investments bear interest at a fixed rate and approximately 92.32 of our debt investments bear interest at a floating rate. As of September 30, 2024, 68.54 of our floating rate debt investments are subject to interest rate floors. Additionally, the Bank of America Credit Facility is subject to floating interest rates and is currently paid based on floating SOFR rates. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income and expenses should interest rates increase by 100, 200 or 300 basis points, or decrease by 100, 200 or 300 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from our portfolio of investments held on September 30, 2024. Interest expense is calculated based on the terms of the Bank of America Credit Facility, using the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. Interest expense on the Bank of America Credit Facility is calculated using the interest rate as of September 30, 2024, adjusted for the impact of hypothetical changes in rates, as shown below. The base interest rate case assumes the rates on our portfolio investments remain unchanged from the actual effective interest rates as of September 30, 2024. 
 97 

Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table (dollar amounts in thousands). 
 Changes in Interest Rates Interest Income Interest Expense Net Income - 300 Basis Points (22,875) (7,827) (15,048) - 200 Basis Points (15,258) (5,218) (10,040) - 100 Basis Points (7,629) (2,609) (5,020) +100 Basis Points 7,629 2,609 5,020 +200 Basis Points 15,258 5,218 10,040 +300 Basis Points 22,888 7,827 15,061 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Based on that evaluation, we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic Securities and Exchange Commission filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information was accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Beginning with the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Fund commenced a share repurchase program in which it intends to repurchase in each quarter, at the discretion of the Board, up to 5 of its Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board, in its sole discretion, may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in the best interest of the Fund s shareholders. All Common Shares purchased by the Fund pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued Common Shares. 
 Under the share repurchase program, to the extent the Fund offers to repurchase Common Shares in any particular quarter, the Fund expects to repurchase Common Shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that Common Shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Fund for the benefit of remaining shareholders. 
 The repurchase of the Adviser s shares, if any, will be on the same terms and subject to the same limitations as other shareholders under the share repurchase program.Class I shares owned by TIAA will be subject to the following restrictions. TIAA may submit its Class I shares for repurchase beginning on March 31, 2027. Beginning March 31, 2027, the total amount of TIAA shares eligible for repurchase will be limited to no more than 1.67 of our aggregate NAV per calendar quarter; provided that, if in any quarter the total amount of aggregate repurchase requests of all classes of Common Shares does not exceed the share repurchase program limit of 5 of the aggregate NAV per calendar quarter, these redemption limits on the TIAA shares will not apply for that quarter, and TIAA will be entitled to submit its shares for repurchase up to the overall share repurchase program limits. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased the following shares pursuant to the share repurchase program (dollars in thousands, except share and per share data):
