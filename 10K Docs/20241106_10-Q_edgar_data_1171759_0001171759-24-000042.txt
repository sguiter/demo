The million Credit Agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan (collectively, the "Credit Facility").

In addition, the Company had amounts issued under letters of credit of million and million as of October 6, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Red Robin International, Inc., is the borrower under the Credit Agreement, and certain of its subsidiaries and the Company are guarantors of the borrower s obligations under the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrower and the guarantors, including the Company, and are available to: (i) refinance certain existing indebtedness of the borrower and its subsidiaries, (ii) pay any fees and expenses in connection with the Credit Agreement, and (iii) provide for the working capital and general corporate requirements of the Company, the borrower and its subsidiaries, including permitted acquisitions and capital expenditures, but excluding restricted payments. 
 On March 4, 2022, Red Robin International, Inc., the Company, and the guarantors also entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement (the Security Agreement granting to the Administrative Agent a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the borrower and the guarantors to secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement.

 On August 21, 2024, the Company entered into the second amendment to our Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment ). The Second Amendment, among other things, provides certain relief from the financial covenant by increasing the required maximum net total leverage ratio beginning in the third quarter of 2024 through the end of the third quarter of 2025; increases the aggregate revolving commitments by million to million through the end of the third quarter of 2025; removes the variable pricing grid and increases the applicable margin on all term loans and revolving loans that are SOFR-based loans to per annum and that are ABR-based loans to per annum; and adds certain additional reporting requirements. 
 In conjunction with the execution of the Second Amendment, the Company paid certain customary amendment fees to the lenders under the credit facility totaling approximately million. The Company performed an analysis of the Second Amendment under ASC Topic 470, Debt , and determined that debt modification accounting was appropriate for our term loan and revolving line of credit due to the change in total capacity and the increase in applicable margin interest rates under the new amendment. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company capitalized million of the amendment fees as deferred loan fees which will be amortized over the remaining term of the Credit Facility, and expensed the remaining million of fees.

 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, right of use assets, and other intangible assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. 
 During 2024 and 2023, the Company measured non-financial assets for impairment using continuing and projected future cash flows, which were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represented a level 3 fair value measurement. 
 During the third quarter and year to date periods of fiscal 2024, we impaired long-lived assets at and restaurant locations, respectively, with a carrying value of approximately million and million, respectively. We determined the fair value of these long-lived assets to be million and million as a result of the closures, resulting in a million and million impairment charge and a million and million decrease in right of use assets due to remeasurement for the quarter and year to date periods of fiscal 2024, respectively. During the third quarter and year to date periods of fiscal 2023, we impaired long-lived assets at and restaurant locations, respectively. We also impaired the closed corporate office during the year to date period of 2023. The carrying value of the assets impaired in the third quarter of 2023 was million and the carrying value of the assets impaired during the year to date period of 2023 was million. We determined the fair value of these long-lived assets to be million and million, resulting in a million and million impairment charge during the quarter and year to date periods of fiscal 2023, respectively. 
 Disclosures of Fair Value of Other Assets and Liabilities 
 The Company's liability under its Credit Facility is carried at historical cost in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of October 6, 2024, the fair value of the Credit Facility was approximately million and the principal amount carrying value was million. The Credit Facility term loan is reported net of million in unamortized discount and debt issuance costs in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 6, 2024. The carrying value of the Credit Facility was million and the fair value of the Credit Facility was million as of December 31, 2023. The interest rate on the Credit Facility represents a level 2 fair value input.

 million for loss contingencies included within Accrued liabilities and other on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the normal course of business, there are various claims in process, matters in litigation, administrative proceedings, and other contingencies. These include employment related claims and class action lawsuits, claims from Guests or Team Members alleging illness, injury, food quality, health, or operational concerns, and lease and other commercial disputes. To date, none of these claims, certain of which are covered by insurance policies, have had a material effect on the Company. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these suits, legal proceedings, and claims with certainty, management is of the opinion that adequate provision for potential losses associated with these matters has been made in the financial statements and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims, or one or more successful claims resulting in greater liabilities than we currently anticipate, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 As of October 6, 2024, we had non-cancellable purchase commitments primarily related to certain vendors who provide food and beverage and other supplies to our restaurants, for an aggregate of million. We expect to fulfill our commitments under these agreements in the normal course of business, and as such, no liability has been recorded.

Terms in this section that are capitalized but not defined have the meanings given to them in the Third Amendment. The summary description of the Third Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety to the full text of the Third Amendment, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

 Revenues 
 Twelve Weeks Ended Forty Weeks Ended (Dollars in thousands) October 6, 2024 October 1, 2023 Percent Change October 6, 2024 October 1, 2023 Percent Change Restaurant revenue 270,605 273,133 (0.9) 943,630 973,307 (3.0) Franchise revenue 3,007 3,418 (12.0) 12,635 12,245 3.2 Other revenue 1,026 1,009 1.7 7,068 8,468 (16.5) Total revenues 274,638 277,560 (1.1) 963,333 994,020 (3.1) Average weekly net sales volumes in Company-owned restaurants 55,007 54,572 0.8 57,261 58,446 (2.0) Total operating weeks 4,920 5,005 (1.7) 16,480 16,653 (1.0) 
 Restaurant revenue, which is comprised primarily of food and beverage sales, decreased 2.5 million, or 0.9 , in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared to the comparable period of 2023. Restaurant revenue decreased primarily due to the closure of 9 locations subsequent to October 1, 2023. Comparable restaurant revenue increased 0.6 and includes a 4.9 increase in average Guest check offset in part by a 4.3 decrease in Guest count. The increase in average Guest check resulted from a 7.5 increase in menu prices, partially offset by a 1.1 decrease from menu mix and a 1.4 decrease from additional discounts. The decrease in menu mix was primarily driven by greater incidence of promotional menu items offered at reduced prices. 
 Restaurant revenue decreased 29.7 million or 3.0 in the year to date period of fiscal 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023. Restaurant revenue decreased primarily due to a 2.1 decrease in comparable restaurant revenue inclusive of a benefit from the change in the Company's loyalty program. Comparable restaurant revenue reflects a 6.5 decrease in Guest count, partially offset by a 4.4 increase in average Guest check. The decrease in Guest count is due in part to overlapping elevated performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, our exit of virtual brands in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and adverse weather impacts during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in average Guest check resulted from a 6.7 increase in menu prices, partially offset by a 2.0 decrease from menu mix and a 0.8 decrease from discounts. The decrease in menu mix was primarily driven by Guests shifting visits from third party delivery platforms with elevated menu prices, to dine in visits at standard menu prices, and reduced incidence of add on menu items. Dine-in sales comprised 76.5 of total food and beverage sales during the year to date period of 2024, as compared to 74.8 in the same period in 2023. 
 Average weekly net sales volumes are calculated as the total restaurant revenue for all Company-owned Red Robin restaurants for each time period presented, divided by the number of operating weeks in the period. 
 Franchise revenue decreased by 0.4 million, or 12.0 , in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in franchisee contributions. Franchise revenue increased by 0.4 million, or 3.2 , in the year to date period of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to an increase in franchisee contributions. Franchisee contributions were reduced in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 in line with the reduction in overall selling expense, following an increase in the first half of fiscal 2024. Franchise restaurants reported a decrease of 1.6 in comparable restaurant revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and a decrease of 2.7 for the year to date period of fiscal 2024 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2023. 
 Other revenue did not change and decreased 1.4 million in the third quarter and year to date periods of fiscal 2024 compared to 2023, respectively. The decrease in the year to date period of fiscal 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily related to business interruption insurance recoveries recognized in 2023.

 Cost of sales, which comprises food and beverage costs, is variable and generally fluctuates with sales volume. Cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased 30 basis points for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the comparable period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by commodity inflation, product mix shift to higher cost menu items, and higher discounts, partially offset by menu price increases and vendor contributions to support our Managing Partner conference recorded as a reduction to cost of sales.

 Cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased 50 basis points for the year to date period of fiscal 2024 as compared to the comparable period in 2023. The improvement was primarily driven by menu price increases and implementation of various cost savings initiatives, partially offset by product mix shifts to higher cost menu items and commodity inflation.

 Labor costs include restaurant level hourly wages and management salaries as well as related taxes and benefits. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, labor as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased 180 basis points compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by strategic investments in management labor and incentive compensation related to a new partner bonus plan, increased hourly labor costs, and higher workers compensation insurance costs. 
 For the year to date period of fiscal 2024, labor as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased 240 basis points compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by strategic investments in hourly and management labor, increased incentive compensation related to a new partner bonus plan, and higher workers compensation and group health insurance costs.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, other operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue is unchanged compared to the same period in 2023. 
 For the year to date period of fiscal 2024, other operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased 10 basis points as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced third party commission expenses associated with lower off premise mix and lower commission rates.

Occupancy costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased 20 basis points for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is due primarily to the impact of fixed rents associated with the sale-leaseback of 28 locations. 
 Occupancy costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased 60 basis points for the year to date period of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is due primarily to the impact of fixed rents associated with the sale-leaseback of 28 locations and the acquisition of five restaurants from a franchisee in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.

 Depreciation and amortization include depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants and corporate assets as well as amortization of reacquired franchise rights, leasehold interests, and certain liquor licenses. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue decreased 40 basis points compared to the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to asset impairments and sale-leaseback transactions reducing the depreciable asset base. 
 For the year to date period of fiscal 2024, depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue decreased 60 basis points compared to the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to asset impairments and sale-leaseback transactions reducing the depreciable asset base.

Components of this category include marketing and advertising costs; restaurant support center, regional, and franchise support salaries and benefits; travel; professional and consulting fees; corporate information systems; legal expenses; office rent; training; and Board of Directors' expenses. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 1.7 million, or 6.0 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the comparable period in 2023. 
 General and administrative costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were 20.8 million, an increase of 2.3 million compared to the comparable period in 2023. The increase is primarily related to costs incurred for the 2024 Managing Partner conference, partially offset by reduced incentive compensation and legal fees as compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Selling costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were 5.5 million, a decrease of 4.0 million compared to the comparable period in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced marketing communication with consumers and related production costs. 
 General and administrative costs in the year to date period of fiscal 2024 were 63.3 million, a decrease of 1.5 million compared to the comparable period in 2023. The decrease is primarily related to reduced incentive compensation accruals as compared to the same period last year, partially offset by costs associated with the 2024 Managing Partner conference. 
 Selling costs in the year to date period of fiscal 2024 were 31.1 million, an increase of 6.5 million compared to the comparable period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increased marketing communication with consumers and related production costs in the first half of fiscal 2024.

 Pre-opening Costs 
 Twelve Weeks Ended Forty Weeks Ended (In thousands, except percentages) October 6, 2024 October 1, 2023 Percent Change October 6, 2024 October 1, 2023 Percent Change Pre-opening costs 586 (100.0) As a percent of total revenues 0.1 (0.1) 
 Pre-opening costs, which are expensed as incurred, comprise the costs related to preparing restaurants to introduce Donatos and other initiatives, as well as direct costs, including labor, occupancy, training, and marketing, incurred related to opening new restaurants and hiring the initial work force. Our pre-opening costs fluctuate from period to period, depending upon, but not limited to, the number of restaurants where Donatos has been introduced, the number of restaurant openings, the size of the restaurants being opened, and the location of the restaurants. Pre-opening costs for any period will typically include expenses associated with restaurants opened during the period as well as expenses related to restaurants opening in subsequent periods. 
 We did not open any new restaurants or roll out any Donatos locations in the year to date period of fiscal 2024. We opened one restaurant and completed the rollout of 25 Donatos locations in the year to date period of fiscal 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023 was 6.3 million and 6.1 million, respectively. The 0.2 million increase was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate to 14.0 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 13.4 in the prior year quarter. Average outstanding debt was 191.6 million and 194.5 million as of October 6, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively. 
 Interest expense was 18.9 million for the year to date period of fiscal 2024 and 20.4 million for the year to date period of fiscal 2023. The 1.4 million decrease was primarily due to the net paydown of debt with the proceeds from the sale-leaseback transactions, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average interest rate to 13.3 for the year to date period of fiscal 2024 compared to 12.6 in the same period last year. Average outstanding debt was 185.2 million and 205.9 million as of October 6, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was a 0.5 benefit, compared to a 3.5 expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The effective tax rate for the year to date period of fiscal 2024 was 0.1 , compared to 6.4 for the year to date period of fiscal 2023. The effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date periods of fiscal 2024 reflects the valuation allowance recorded against the Company's net tax assets in addition to certain state income taxes due to attribute limitations, minimum state income taxes, and state franchise taxes. The higher effective tax rate for the fiscal 2023 periods as compared to the fiscal 2024 periods is due to the near break-even pretax book income generated in fiscal 2023.

 We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted income (loss) per share-diluted are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures give the reader additional insight into the ongoing operational results of the Company and are intended to supplement the presentation of the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted income (loss) per share-diluted exclude the impact of non-operating or nonrecurring items including changes in estimates, asset impairments, litigation contingencies, gains (losses) on debt extinguishment, restaurant and office closure costs, gains on sale leaseback transactions, severance and executive transition costs and other non-recurring, non-cash or discrete items net of income tax impacts. Other companies may define these non-GAAP measures differently, and as a result our measures may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Adjusted income (loss) per share-diluted and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income (loss) as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of performance.

 The Company believes restaurant level operating profit is an important measure for management and investors because it is widely regarded in the restaurant industry as a useful metric by which to evaluate restaurant level operating efficiency and performance. The Company defines restaurant level operating profit to be income from operations less franchise revenue and other revenue, plus other charges (gains), net, pre-opening costs, selling costs, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization. The measure includes restaurant level occupancy costs that include fixed rents, percentage rents, common area maintenance charges, real estate and personal property taxes, general liability insurance, and other property costs, but excludes depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which is related to restaurant level assets, because such expenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash outlay for the restaurants. The measure also excludes costs associated with selling, general, and administrative functions, and pre-opening costs, as well as, other charges (gains), net because these costs are non-operating or nonrecurring and therefore not related to the ongoing operations of its restaurants. Restaurant level operating profit is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative, to income (loss) from operations as an indicator of financial performance. Restaurant level operating profit as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in the Company's industry.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased 1.3 million to 30.3 million as of October 6, 2024, from 31.6 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. As of October 6, 2024, the Company had approximately 42.0 million in liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents and 20.0 million available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility. 
 Cash Flows 
 The table below summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for each period presented (in thousands): 
 Forty Weeks Ended October 6, 2024 October 1, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,840 17,361 Net cash provided by investing activities 4,873 18,992 Net cash used in financing activities (7,990) (33,741) Net change in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash (1,277) 2,612 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased 15.5 million to 1.8 million for the year to date period of fiscal 2024 compared to 17.4 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to the decrease in restaurant level profitability. 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 Net cash flows provided by investing activities decreased to 4.9 million for the year to date period of fiscal 2024, as compared to net cash flows provided by investing activities of 19.0 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2023. The 14.1 million decrease in cash flows provided by investing activities is primarily due to lower proceeds from sale lease-back transactions in the current year period, partially offset by a reduction in current year capital expenditures. In addition, cash provided by investing activities in the prior year included a 3.5 million cash outflow for the acquisition of five franchised restaurants. 
 The following table lists the components of our capital expenditures for the periods presented (in thousands): 
 Forty Weeks Ended October 6, 2024 October 1, 2023 Restaurant improvement capital and other 9,772 16,715 Technology, infrastructure, and other 9,642 10,336 Donatos expansion 
 8,602 New restaurants and restaurant refreshes 1,421 Total capital expenditures 19,414 37,074 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 Net cash flows used in financing activities decreased to 8.0 million for the year to date period of fiscal 2024, as compared to 33.7 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2023. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2024 primarily relate to the paydown of 21.2 million of debt with proceeds from the sale-leaseback transaction and debt issuance costs associated with an amendment to the credit facility, partially offset by 20 million in net borrowings on the revolving credit facility. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 primarily relate to the net paydown of debt of 24.6 million and 10.0 million in share repurchases.

 Credit Facility 
 On March 4, 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the "Credit Agreement"), which provides for a Senior Secured Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Agreement's interest rate references the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements and backed by U.S. Treasury securities, or the Alternate Base Rate, which represents the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5 per annum, or (c) one-month term SOFR plus 1.0 per annum. 
 On August 21, 2024, the Company entered into the second amendment to our Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment ). The Second Amendment among other things: provides certain relief from the financial covenant by increasing the required maximum net total leverage ratio beginning in the third quarter of 2024 through the end of the third quarter of 2025; increases the aggregate revolving commitments by 15.0 million to 40.0 million through the end of the third quarter of 2025; removes the variable pricing grid and increases the applicable margin on all term loans and revolving loans that are SOFR-based loans to 7.50 per annum and that are ABR-based loans to 6.50 per annum; and adds certain additional reporting requirements. 
 On November 4, 2024, the Company entered into the third amendment to our Credit Agreement (the "Third Amendment") which extends the provisions of the Second Amendment through the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2026. 
 As of October 6, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of 180.7 million, net of 7.2 million of unamortized deferred financing charges and discounts, none of which was classified as current. As of October 6, 2024, the Company had 20.0 million of available borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility and 8.1 million of letters of credit issued against cash collateral. The Company's cash collateral is reported in Restricted cash on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Covenants 
 We are subject to a number of customary covenants under our Credit Facility, including limitations on additional borrowings, acquisitions, stock repurchases, sales of assets, and dividend payments, as well as a net total leverage ratio covenant, as defined, that adjusts periodically as specified in the Third Amendment to our Credit Agreement. As of October 6, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. 
 Additionally, as noted under " Credit Facility above, the Third Amendment extended the increase in the required maximum net total leverage ratio covenant from the third quarter of 2025 through the end of the first quarter of 2026. 
 Working Capital 
 We typically maintain current liabilities in excess of our current assets which results in a working capital deficit. We are able to operate with a working capital deficit because restaurant sales are primarily conducted on a cash or credit card basis. Rapid turnover of inventory results in limited investment in inventories, and cash from sales is usually received before related payables for food, supplies, and payroll become due. In addition, receipts from the sale of gift cards are received well in advance of related redemptions. Rather than maintain higher cash balances that would result from this pattern of operating cash flows, we typically utilize operating cash flows in excess of those required for currently maturing liabilities to pay for capital expenditures, debt repayment, or to repurchase stock. When necessary, we utilize our Credit Facility to satisfy short-term liquidity requirements. We believe our future cash flows generated from restaurant operations combined with our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, and cash on hand, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and fund capital expenditures over the next 12 months. 
 Share Repurchase 
 On August 9, 2018, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company's current share repurchase program of up to a total of 75.0 million of the Company's common stock. The share repurchase authorization will terminate upon completing repurchases of 75.0 million of common stock unless otherwise terminated by the board. Pursuant to the repurchase program, purchases may be made from time to time at the Company's discretion and the Company is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock. From the date of the current program approval through October 6, 2024, we have repurchased a total of 1,088,588 shares at an average price of 15.18 per share for an aggregate amount of 16,520,000. The Company completed no share repurchases during the quarter and year to date periods ended October 6, 2024. Accordingly, as of October 6, 2024, we had 58.5 million of availability under the current share repurchase program. Our Credit Agreement limits our ability to repurchase shares to certain conditions set forth by the lenders in the Credit Facility.

 Seasonality 
 Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Sales in most of our restaurants were historically higher during the spring months and winter holiday season due to factors including our retail-oriented locations and family appeal. As a result, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality, and seasonality of sales may shift over time. Accordingly, results for any one quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There were no other material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations since the filing of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies . 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Critical accounting estimates are those we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, including our estimates of future restaurant level cash flows, which are subject to the current economic environment and potentially unknown future events, and we might obtain different results if we use different assumptions or conditions. We had no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates which were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, intentions, plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements which are other than statements of historical facts. These statements may be identified, without limitation, by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "anticipate," "assume," "believe," "could," "estimate," "expect," "future," "intend," "may," "plan," "project," "will," "would," and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in this report relate to, among other things: (i) our business objectives and strategic plans; (ii) working capital, and the ability of our future cash flows from restaurant operations and our borrowing capacity to satisfy future working capital deficits and capital expenditures; (iii) our share repurchase program; (iv) our expectations about restaurant operating costs, including commodity and food prices and labor and energy costs, and our ability to mitigate potential increases in such costs; (v) anticipated continued investments in our partnership with Donatos and other restaurant improvements, including the timing thereof; (vi) our expectations about anticipated uses of, and risks associated with, future cash flows, liquidity, capital expenditures, other capital deployment opportunities and taxes; (vii) the seasonality of our business; (viii) our ability to successfully implement, and our expectations regarding, our North Star five-point plan to enhance the Company s competitive positioning; (ix) litigation contingencies and the adequacy of our reserves for legal matters; (x) our expectations regarding, and our ability to mitigate changes in, interest rates, commodity prices, and other factors; (xi) our strategies to enhance our liquidity position; and (xii) transactions including sale-leaseback transactions and acquisitions of certain restaurants from a franchisee. 
 Although we believe the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such expectations may prove to be materially incorrect due to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. 
 In some cases, information regarding certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from a forward-looking statement appears together with such statement. In addition, the factors described under Risk Factors, as well as other possible factors not listed, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, the effectiveness of the Company's strategic initiatives, including our North Star plan, labor and service models, and operational improvement initiatives and our ability to execute on such strategic initiatives; the global and domestic economic and geopolitical environment; our ability to effectively compete in the industry and attract and retain Guests; the adequacy of cash flows and the cost and availability of capital or credit facility borrowings; a privacy or security breach or a failure of our information technology systems; the effectiveness and timing of the Company's marketing and branding strategies, including the loyalty program and social media platforms; changes in consumer preferences; leasing space including the location of such leases in areas of declining traffic; changes in cost and availability of commodities; interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from third parties; pricing increases and labor costs; changes in consumer behavior or preference; expanding our restaurant base; maintaining and improving our existing restaurants; the transition and retention of our key personnel; our ability to recruit, staff, train, and retain our workforce; operating conditions, including adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, pandemics and other events affecting the regions where our restaurants are operated; actions taken by our franchisees that could harm our business or reputation; negative publicity regarding food safety or health concerns; protection of our intellectual property rights; changes in federal, state, or local laws and regulations affecting the operation of our restaurants; an increase in litigation or legal claims by Team Members, franchisees, customers, vendors, stockholders and others; and the other Risk Factors described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances.

 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There has been no material change in the interest rate risk or commodity price risk since the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We continue to monitor our interest rate risk on an ongoing basis and may use interest rate swaps or similar instruments in the future to manage our exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings as the Company deems appropriate. As of October 6, 2024, we had 187.9 million of borrowings subject to variable interest rates. A 1.0 change in the effective interest rate applied to these loans would have resulted in pre-tax interest expense fluctuation of 1.9 million on an annualized basis. 
 We purchase food, supplies and other commodities for use in our operations based on prices established with our suppliers. We may or may not have the ability to increase menu prices, or vary menu items, in response to commodity price increases. A 1.0 increase in food and beverage costs would negatively impact cost of sales by approximately 2.9 million on an annualized basis. 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the management of the Company ("Management"), including the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. The Company's CEO and CFO have concluded that, based upon the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
