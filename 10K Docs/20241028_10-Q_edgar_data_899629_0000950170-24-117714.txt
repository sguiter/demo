All of the Company s derivative instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges and hedge the future cash outflows on variable-rate debt Note 7 ). It is estimated that approximately million included in Accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified as a reduction to interest expense within the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , derivatives were designated as fair value hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Additionally, the Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any derivatives that are not designated hedges. Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and, from time to time, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the values of which are determined by interest rates. The Company s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Company s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company s investments and borrowings. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the swaps if the derivative position has a positive balance. The Company believes it mitigates its credit risk by entering into swaps with major financial institutions. The Company continually monitors and actively manages interest costs on its variable-rate debt portfolio and may enter into additional interest rate swap positions or other derivative interest rate instruments based on market conditions. Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features The Company has agreements with each of its swap counterparties that contain a provision whereby if the Company defaults on certain of its unsecured indebtedness, the Company could also be declared in default on its swaps, resulting in an acceleration of payment under the swaps.

SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
 Segment Reporting 
 During the second quarter of 2024 we renamed our historical Funds segment as the Investment Management segment. No prior period information was recast and the designation change did not impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 12 .

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired four Core properties, one Core land parcel, and one consolidated Investment Management property, as follows Note 2 ):

The Credit Facility and existing 400.0 million unsecured term loan Term Loan have a maturity date of April 15, 2028, with two additional six-month extension options. Borrowings under the Revolver and the Term Loan will accrue interest at a floating rate based on SOFR with margins based on leverage or credit rating Note 7 ).

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we originated one Core note receivable of 7.6 million to a related party, which is collateralized by the borrower s equity interest in various partnerships, bears interest at 12 and matures on December 31, 2025. 
 Common Shares 
 In January 2024, the Company completed an underwritten offering of 6,900,000 Common Shares (inclusive of the underwriters option to purchase 900,000 additional shares) for net proceeds of 113.0 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 10,273,250 Common Shares under our ATM Program generating 216.9 million of net proceeds after related issuance costs Note 10 ).

On October 16, 2024, the Company physically settled the Forward Sale Agreements and received net proceeds of 131.8 million Note 16 ). 
 Economic and Other Considerations 
 Heightened levels of inflation and higher interest rates present risks for our business and our tenants. We continue to monitor and address risks related to the economy. In recent years, inflation levels were elevated resulting in increased costs for certain goods and services and cost of borrowing. Inflation began to decrease in the second quarter of 2023 but still remains at elevated levels compared to the years preceding 2021. While the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates in September 2024 and may lower interest rates further in 2024 or later periods, we cannot provide any assurance that further interest rate reductions, if any, or other monetary policy changes, will positively affect our business, results of operations or consolidated financial statements. Most of our leases include contractual rent escalations and require tenants to pay their share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. We believe we manage our properties in a cost-conscious manner to minimize recurring operational expenses and utilize multi-year contracts to alleviate the impact of inflation on our business and our tenants. We also continue to see rising consumer confidence and we expect to continue to add value to our portfolio by executing on our current leasing momentum, our active development and redevelopment projects, and leasing pipeline. We manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through the use of fixed-rate debt and interest rate swap and cap agreements, which qualify for, and are designated as, hedging instruments. Except for increased interest costs, we have not experienced any material negative impacts at this time.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 Net Property Operating Income 
 The following discussion of net property operating income NOI and rent spreads on new and renewal leases includes the activity from both our consolidated and our pro-rata share of unconsolidated properties within our Core Portfolio. Investment Management invests primarily in properties that typically require significant leasing and development. Given that Investment Management is primarily comprised of finite-life investment vehicles, these properties are sold following stabilization. For these reasons, we believe NOI and rent spreads are not meaningful measures for our Investment Management investments. 
 NOI represents property revenues less property expenses. We consider NOI and rent spreads on new and renewal leases for our Core Portfolio to be appropriate supplemental disclosures of portfolio operating performance due to their widespread acceptance and use within the REIT investor and analyst communities. NOI and rent spreads on new and renewal leases are presented to assist investors in analyzing our property performance, however, our method of calculating these may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.

Funds from Operations 
 We consider funds from operations FFO as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT to be an appropriate supplemental disclosure of operating performance due to its widespread acceptance and use within the REIT investor and analyst communities. FFO is presented to assist investors in analyzing our performance. It is helpful as it excludes various items included in net income that are not indicative of the operating performance, such as gains (losses) from sales of depreciated property, depreciation and amortization, and impairment of real estate. Our method of calculating FFO may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by GAAP and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash needs, including distributions. It should not be considered as an alternative to net income for the purpose of evaluating our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Consistent with the NAREIT definition, we define FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciated property and impairment of depreciable real estate, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Also consistent with NAREIT s definition of FFO, the Company has elected to include gains and losses incidental to its main business (including those related to its RCP investments, such as Albertsons) in FFO. A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Acadia to FFO follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Uses of Liquidity and Cash Requirements 
 Generally, our principal uses of liquidity are (i) distributions to our shareholders and OP unit holders, (ii) investments, which include the funding of our capital committed to the Funds in our Investment Management platform and property acquisitions and development/re-tenanting activities within our Core Portfolio, (iii) distributions to our Fund investors, (iv) debt service and loan repayments and (v) share repurchases. 
 Distributions 
 In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid dividends and distributions on our Common Shares and Preferred OP Units totaling 58.7 million. 
 Investments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired four Core properties, one Core land parcel, and one consolidated Investment Management property, as described below Note 2 ): 
 In July 2024, through Investment Management, we acquired a shopping center, the Walk at Highwoods Preserve, located in Tampa, Florida for 30.8 million, inclusive of transaction costs. 

In September 2024, we acquired a Core development land parcel as part of the overall Henderson Avenue development project in Dallas, Texas for 1.1 million, inclusive of transaction costs. 

In September 2024, we acquired the Bleecker Street Portfolio in the Core, a four property retail portfolio (inclusive of a parking garage) in New York, New York for 20.3 million, inclusive of transaction costs. 

Structured Financing Investments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we originated one Core note receivable of 7.6 million to a related party, which is secured by the borrower s equity interest in the Renaissance Portfolio, 1238 Wisconsin Avenue, and another Georgetown property, bears interest at 12 and matures on December 31, 2025 Note 3 ). 
 Capital Commitments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made capital contributions aggregating 11.7 million to our Funds. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our share of the remaining capital commitments to our Funds aggregated 17.5 million as follows: 
 0.5 million to Fund III Fund III was launched in May 2007 with total committed capital of 450.0 million, of which our original share was 89.6 million. During 2015, we acquired an additional interest, which had an original capital commitment of 20.9 million. 

5.5 million to Fund IV Fund IV was launched in May 2012 with total committed capital of 530.0 million, of which our original share was 122.5 million. 

11.5 million to Fund V Fund V was launched in August 2016 with total committed capital of 520.0 million, of which our original share was 104.5 million. 

Development Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, capitalized costs associated with development activities totaled 13.9 million Note 2 ). As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 10 consolidated projects under development or redevelopment, for which the estimated total cost to complete these projects through 2028 was 54.0 million to 168.0 million, and our estimated share was approximately 54.0 million to 168.0 million. Substantially all remaining development and redevelopment costs are discretionary, and could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the current inflationary environment, rising interest rates, and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

1,870,141 

As of September 30, 2024, our consolidated indebtedness aggregated 1,590.4 million, excluding unamortized premium of 0.2 million and net unamortized loan costs of 11.0 million, and was collateralized by 31 properties and related tenant leases. Stated interest rates on our outstanding indebtedness ranged from 3.99 to SOFR + 3.75 with maturities that ranged from October 5, 2024 to April 15, 2035, without regard to available extension options. With respect to the debt maturing in 2024, we are actively pursuing refinancing the remaining obligations, though there can be no assurance that we can refinance such obligations on favorable terms or at all. Taking into consideration 875.1 million of notional principal under variable to fixed-rate swap agreements currently in effect, 1,166.1 million of the portfolio debt, or 73.3 , was fixed at a 5.02 weighted average interest rate and 424.3 million, or 26.7 , was floating at a 7.76 weighted average interest rate as of September 30, 2024. Our variable-rate debt includes 151.0 million of debt subject to interest rate caps. 
 Without regard to available extension options, as of September 30, 2024, we had 171.9 million of debt maturing in 2024 at a weighted-average interest rate of 5.71 ; 1.2 million of scheduled principal amortization due in the remainder of 2024; and our share of scheduled remaining 2024 principal payments and maturities on our unconsolidated debt was 43.4 million. In addition, 542.1 million of our total consolidated debt and 44.8 million of our pro-rata share of unconsolidated debt will come due by September 30, 2025. With respect to the debt maturing in 2024 and 2025, we have options to extend consolidated debt aggregating 0.0 million and 327.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully execute any or all of its available extension options. For the remaining indebtedness, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness, and, therefore, we expect to refinance at least a portion of this indebtedness or select other alternatives based on market conditions as these loans mature; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to obtain financing could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the current inflationary environment, rising interest rates, and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 We maintain a share repurchase program under which 122.5 million remains available as of September 30, 2024 Note 10 ). We did not repurchase any shares under this program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of capital for funding our short-term (less than 12 months) and long-term (12 months and longer) liquidity needs include (i) the issuance of both public equity and OP Units, (ii) the issuance of both secured and unsecured debt, (iii) unfunded capital commitments from noncontrolling interests within Investment Management, (iv) future sales of existing properties, (v) repayments of structured financing investments, (vi) liquidation of marketable securities, and (vii) cash on hand and future cash flow from operating activities. Our cash on hand in our consolidated subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024 totaled 46.2 million. Our remaining sources of liquidity are described further below. 
 Issuance of Common Shares 
 In January 2024, the Company completed an underwritten offering of 6,900,000 Common Shares (inclusive of the underwriters option to purchase 900,000 additional shares) for net proceeds of 113.0 million. 
 In September 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement and forward sales agreements with various underwriters and forward purchasers (the Forward Sales Agreements ), which is accounted for in equity, to offer and sell 5,750,000 (inclusive of the underwriters 
 54 

exercised option to purchase 750,000 additional shares) of its Common Shares on a forward basis. On October 16, 2024, the Company physically settled the Forward Sale Agreements and received net proceeds of 131.8 million. 
 ATM Program 
 We have an ATM Program Note 10 that provides us with an efficient and low-cost vehicle for raising capital through public equity issuances on an as-we-go basis to fund our capital needs. Through this program, we have been able to effectively match-fund the required capital for our Core Portfolio and our share of Investment Management acquisitions through the issuance of Common Shares over extended periods employing a price averaging strategy. In addition, from time to time, we have issued and may issue, equity in follow-on offerings separate from our ATM Program. Net proceeds raised through our ATM Program and follow-on offerings are primarily used for acquisitions, both for our Core Portfolio and our pro-rata share of Investment Management acquisitions, and for general corporate purposes. The Company sold 8,533,962 and 10,273,250 Common Shares under its ATM Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 generating 187.0 million and 216.9 million of net proceeds after related issuance costs, respectively. 
 Investment Management Capital 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Fund V called for capital contributions of 57.8 million, of which our aggregate share was 11.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, unfunded capital commitments from noncontrolling interests within Funds II, III, IV and V were 0, 1.4 million, 18.5 million and 45.9 million, respectively. 
 Asset Sales and Other Transactions 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we deconsolidated one Core property, two consolidated Investment Management properties and one outparcel, and one unconsolidated investment, as follows: 
 On April 3, 2024, Fund IV sold its consolidated 2207 and 2208-2216 Fillmore Street properties for a total sales price of 14.1 million and repaid the related 6.4 million of debt at closing. Fund IV recognized a gain of 2.4 million, of which the Company s proportionate share was 0.5 million Note 2 ). 

On May 16, 2024, we sold a 95 interest in the Shops at Grand property for a total of 48.3 million and retained a 5 ownership interest through an investment in a newly formed joint venture which was fair valued at 2.4 million. As we now have a noncontrolling interest, we recognized a loss on deconsolidation of 2.2 million related to transaction costs Note 2 ). 

On June 28, 2024, Fund V sold an outparcel at Canton Marketplace property for 2.2 million and recognized a gain of 0.6 million, of which the Company s proportionate share was 0.1 million Note 2 ). 

On June 28, 2024, Fund IV sold its unconsolidated Paramus Plaza property for a total of 36.8 million and repaid the related debt of 27.9 million. Fund IV recognized a gain of 4.1 million, of which the Company s proportionate share was 1.0 million Note 4 ). 

On September 25, 2024, Fund V sold its unconsolidated Frederick Crossing property for 47.2 million and repaid the related debt of 23.2 million. Fund V recognized a gain of 11.6 million, of which the Company s proportionate share was 2.3 million Note 4 ). 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 500,000 shares of Albertsons, generating net proceeds of 10.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, we held 0.9 million shares of Albertsons which had a fair value of 17.5 million Note 8 ). In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized dividend income of 0.4 million Note 8 ). 
 Structured Financing Repayments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received full payment on a 6.0 million Core Portfolio note. 
 Financing and Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 469.0 million of capacity under existing Core Portfolio debt facilities. In addition, as of that date within our Core Portfolio and Investment Management, we had 132 unleveraged consolidated properties with an aggregate carrying value of approximately 1.8 billion, although there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain financing for these properties at favorable terms, if at all.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of cash inflows from rental revenue, and cash outflows for property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and interest and debt expense. 
 Our operating activities provided 12.6 million less cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the 28.2 million dividend received from our investment in Albertsons in 2023. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities is impacted by our investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates, the timing and extent of our real estate development, capital improvements, and acquisition and disposition activities during the period. 
 Our investing activities provided 40.0 million more cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to (i) 58.7 million more cash received from the disposition of properties in 2024, (ii) 20.8 million less cash used in our investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates, (iii) 8.1 million more cash received from the sale of marketable securities, and (iv) 6.0 million more received from the payment of a note receivable. These sources of cash were offset by (i) 27.0 million less cash received from return of capital of unconsolidated affiliates, (ii) 11.1 million more cash used for development, construction and property improvement costs, (iii) 8.2 million more cash used to originate a note receivable and (iv) 6.4 million more cash used for the acquisition of real estate. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities is impacted by the timing and extent of issuances of debt and equity securities, distributions paid to common shareholders and unitholders of the Operating Partnership, as well as principal and other payments associated with our outstanding indebtedness. 
 Our financing activities provided 21.7 million more cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from (i) 328.8 million more cash provided by the sale of Common Shares, (ii) 14.3 million more cash provided by contributions from noncontrolling interests, and (iii) 8.0 million less cash distributed to noncontrolling interests. These increases were offset by (i) 317.5 million more cash used to repay debt, (ii) 7.2 million more cash used for payment of deferred financing fees, and (iii) 3.3 million more used to pay dividends.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 We have the following investments made through joint ventures (that may include, among others, tenancy-in common and other similar investments) for the purpose of investing in operating properties. We account for these investments using the equity method of accounting. As such, our financial statements reflect our investment and our share of income and loss from, but not the individual assets and liabilities, of these joint ventures. 
 See Note 4 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for a discussion of our unconsolidated investments. The Operating Partnership s pro-rata share of unconsolidated non-recourse debt related to those investments is as follows (dollars in millions):

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe there have been no material changes to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies under Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 Reference is made to Note 1 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about recently issued accounting pronouncements. 
 ITEM 3. 	 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 Information as of September 30, 2024 
 Our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates related to our mortgage and other debt. See Note 7 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for certain quantitative details related to our mortgage and other debt. 
 57 

Currently, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through the use of fixed-rate debt and interest rate swap and cap agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we had total mortgage and other notes payable of 1,590.4 million, excluding the unamortized premium of 0.2 million and net unamortized debt issuance costs of 11.0 million, of which 1,166.1 million, or 73.3 was fixed-rate, inclusive of debt with rates fixed through the use of derivative financial instruments, and 424.3 million, or 26.7 , was variable-rate based upon SOFR or Prime rates plus certain spreads. As of September 30, 2024, we were party to 34 interest rate swaps and four interest rate cap agreements to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to 875.1 million and 151.0 million of variable-rate debt, respectively. For a discussion of the risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Liquidity and Indebtedness on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 If we decided to employ higher leverage levels, we would be subject to increased debt service requirements and a higher risk of default on our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our financial conditions, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our shareholders. In addition, increases or changes in interest rates could cause our borrowing costs to rise and may limit our ability to refinance debt. 
 The following table sets forth information as of September 30, 2024 concerning our long-term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity (without regard to available extension options) and weighted average effective interest rates of maturing amounts (dollars in millions):

Without regard to available extension options, in the remainder of 2024, 173.1 million of our total consolidated debt and 43.4 million of our pro-rata share of unconsolidated outstanding debt will become due. In addition, 452.5 million of our total consolidated debt and 10.5 million of our pro-rata share of unconsolidated debt will become due in 2025. As it relates to the aforementioned maturing debt in 2024 and 2025, we 
 58 

have options to extend consolidated debt aggregating 0.0 million and 327.0 million, respectively; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able successfully execute any or all of its available extension options. As we intend on refinancing some or all of such debt at the then-existing market interest rates, which may be greater than the current interest rates, our interest expense would increase by approximately 6.7 million annually if the interest rate on the refinanced debt increased by 100 basis points. After giving effect to noncontrolling interests, our share of this increase would be 2.3 million. Interest expense on our variable-rate debt of 424.3 million, net of variable to fixed-rate swap agreements currently in effect, as of September 30, 2024, would increase 4.2 million if corresponding rate indices increased by 100 basis points. After giving effect to noncontrolling interests, our share of this increase would be 1.2 million. We may seek additional variable-rate financing if and when pricing and other commercial and financial terms warrant. As such, we would consider hedging against the interest rate risk related to such additional variable-rate debt through interest rate swaps and protection agreements, or other means. 
 Based on our outstanding debt balances as of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our total consolidated outstanding debt would decrease by approximately 10.9 million if interest rates increased by 1 . Conversely, if interest rates decreased by 1 , the fair value of our total outstanding debt would increase by approximately 10.9 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had consolidated notes receivable of 126.6 million and 124.9 million, respectively. We determined the estimated fair value of our notes receivable by discounting future cash receipts utilizing a discount rate equivalent to the rate at which similar notes receivable would be originated under conditions then existing. 
 Based on our outstanding notes receivable balances as of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our total outstanding notes receivable would decrease by approximately 0.8 million if interest rates increased by 1 . Conversely, if interest rates decreased by 1 , the fair value of our total outstanding notes receivable would increase by approximately 0.9 million. 
 Summarized Information as of December 31, 2023 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had total mortgage and other notes payable of 1,881.1 million, excluding the unamortized premium of 0.2 million and unamortized debt issuance costs of 11.2 million, of which 1,454.7 million, or 77.3 , was fixed-rate, inclusive of debt with rates fixed through the use of derivative financial instruments, and 426.4 million, or 22.7 , was variable-rate based upon LIBOR rates plus certain spreads. As of December 31, 2023, we were party to 36 interest rate swap and three interest rate cap agreements to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to 1,249.8 million and 151.4 million of SOFR-based variable-rate debt, respectively. 
 Interest expense on our variable-rate debt of 426.4 million as of December 31, 2023, would have increased 4.3 million if corresponding rate indices increased by 100 basis points. Based on our outstanding debt balances as of December 31, 2023, the fair value of our total outstanding debt would have decreased by approximately 6.9 million if interest rates increased by 1 . Conversely, if interest rates decreased by 1 , the fair value of our total outstanding debt would have increased by approximately 6.6 million. 
 Changes in Market Risk Exposures from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 
 Our interest rate risk exposure from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024, has decreased on an absolute basis, as the 426.4 million of variable-rate debt as of December 31, 2023 has decreased to 424.3 million as of September 30, 2024. Our interest rate exposure as a percentage of total debt has increased, as our variable-rate debt accounted for 22.7 of our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2023 compared to 26.7 as of September 30, 2024. 
 ITEM 4. 	 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures include internal controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in this and other reports filed under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the required time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. It should be noted that no system of controls can provide complete assurance of achieving a company s objectives and that future events may impact the effectiveness of a system of controls. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, after conducting an evaluation, together with members of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2024, at a reasonable level of assurance. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
