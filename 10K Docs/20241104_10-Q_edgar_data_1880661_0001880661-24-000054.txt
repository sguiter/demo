 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report may contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipates, intends, plans, seeks, believes, estimates, expects and similar references to future periods, or by the inclusion of forecasts or projections. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding the outlook for our future business and financial performance, estimated operational metrics, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, including, among other things, statements regarding expected growth, future capital expenditures, fund performance, dividends and dividend policy and debt service obligations, such as those contained in Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, by their nature, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the inability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Angelo, Gordon Co., L.P. and AG Funds L.P. (collectively, Angelo Gordon unexpected costs related to the integration of the Angelo Gordon business and operations; our ability to manage growth and execute our business plan; and regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory conditions, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our Annual Report filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 23, 2024 and in subsequent filings with the SEC, as such factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC s website at https://www.sec.gov, and Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 For the reasons described above, we caution you against relying on any forward-looking statements, which should also be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included elsewhere in this report. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speaks only as of the date on which we make it. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

 Fees and Other 
 Fees and other are accounted for as contracts with customers under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). The guidance for contracts with customers provides a five-step framework that requires the Company to (i) identify the contract with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognize revenue when the Company satisfies its performance obligations. In determining the transaction price, the Company includes variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.

Management Fees 
 The Company provides investment management services to the TPG funds, limited partners, SMAs and clients, and other vehicles in exchange for a management fee. Management fees also include catch-up fees, also known as out of period management fees, which are fees paid in any given period that relate to a prior period, usually as the result of a new limited partner coming into a fund in a subsequent close. Management fees are determined quarterly based on an annual rate and are generally based upon a percentage of capital committed, net funded capital commitments, cost of investments, Net Asset Value NAV or actively invested capital or as otherwise defined in the respective management agreements. Since some of the factors that cause management fees to fluctuate are outside of the Company s control, management fees are considered constrained and are not included in the transaction price until the uncertainty relating to the constraint is subsequently resolved. After the contract is established, management does not make any significant judgments in determining the transaction price. 
 Actively invested capital Net funded capital commitments Cost of investments NAV

million and million, respectively. For three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, these amounts totaled million and million, respectively. Amounts payable to investment funds are recorded in due to affiliates in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Monitoring Fees 
 The Company provides monitoring services to certain portfolio companies in exchange for a fee, which is recognized over time as services are rendered. After the monitoring contract is established, there are no significant judgments made in determining the transaction price. 
 Transaction Fees 
 The Company provides capital structuring and other advice to portfolio companies, third parties and other vehicles generally in connection with debt and equity arrangements, as well as underwriting and placement services for a fee at a point in time when the underlying advisory services rendered are complete. Transaction fees are separately negotiated for each transaction and are generally based on the underlying transaction value. After the contract is established, management makes no significant judgments when determining the transaction price. 
 Incentive Fees 
 The Company provides investment management services to certain TPG funds and other vehicles in exchange for a management fee as discussed above and, in some cases, an incentive fee when the Company is not entitled to performance allocations, as further discussed below. Incentive fees are considered variable consideration in the scope of the revenue guidance as these fees are affected by changes in the fair value of investments over the performance period. The Company recognizes incentive fees only when these amounts are no longer subject to significant reversal, which is typically at the end of a defined performance period and/or upon expiration of the associated clawback period. After the contract is established, there are no significant judgments made when determining the transaction price. 
 Expense Reimbursements and Other 
 In providing investment management and advisory services to TPG funds and monitoring services to the portfolio companies, TPG routinely contracts for services from third parties. In situations where the Company is viewed, for accounting purposes only, as having incurred these third-party costs on behalf of the TPG funds or portfolio companies, the cost of such services is presented net as a reduction of the Company s revenues. In all other situations, the expenses and related reimbursements associated with these services are presented on a gross basis, which are classified as part of the Company s expenses, and reimbursements of such costs are classified as expense reimbursements within revenues in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. After the contract is established, there are no significant judgments made when determining the transaction price.

years. Some of those leases include options to extend for additional terms ranging from one to years. The Company s other leases, including those for office equipment, vehicles and aircraft, are not significant. Additionally, the Company s leases do not contain restrictions or covenants that restrict the Company from incurring other financial obligations. The Company also does not provide any residual value guarantees for the leases or have any significant leases that have yet to be commenced. From time to time, the Company enters into certain sublease agreements that have terms similar to the remaining terms of the master lease agreements between TPG and the landlord. Sublease income is recorded as an offset to general, administrative and other in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded within general, administrative and other in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 
 , using the straight-line method. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When evidence of loss in value has occurred, management compares the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the long-lived asset to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment has occurred. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment is recorded as the difference between the fair value of the long-lived asset and its carrying value. Fair value is based on estimated discounted cash flows associated with the long-lived asset.

 (c) Represents the fair value of approximately million vested Common Units granted to the Angelo Gordon partners upon consummation of the Acquisition. The fair value of Common Units was based on a closing price for the shares of Class A common stock on the Acquisition Date, adjusted for a discount for lack of marketability. Approximately million unvested Common Units and million Service Awards available to be granted in connection with the Acquisition are considered compensatory under U.S. GAAP and are not part of the Purchase Price.

The estimated fair value of million, reflected as contingent consideration, was determined using a present value approach. Inputs to fair value include the present value period and the discount rate applied to the annual payments. 
 (e) Represents the estimated fair value of the non-compensatory portion of the Earnout Payment expected to be paid in the form of cash and vested Common Units to Angelo Gordon partners upon satisfaction of certain FRR targets during the Measurement Period. This amount, reflected as contingent consideration, was determined using a multiple probability simulation approach. Inputs to the fair value include probability adjusted FRR amounts and FRR target thresholds. The compensatory portion of the Earnout Payment to the Angelo Gordon partners is treated as post-combination compensation expense, as services are required from such partners post-Closing. See Note 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details. 
 The total Purchase Price was allocated to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Acquisition Date, with the excess Purchase Price recorded as goodwill. A third-party valuation specialist assisted the Company with the fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company recorded million of goodwill as of the Acquisition Date. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the scale, skill sets, operations and expected synergies that can be achieved subsequent to the Acquisition. The goodwill recorded is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

million and million, respectively, which primarily relates to excess income tax basis versus book basis differences in connection with the Company s investment in the TPG Operating Group. The excess of income tax basis in the TPG Operating Group is primarily due to the Reorganization and subsequent exchanges of Common Units for Class A common stock, including the exchanges of Common Units for Class A common stock on February 27, 2024, May 21, 2024, and August 19, 2024. As a result of the Reorganization and subsequent exchanges, the Company recorded deferred tax assets generated by the step-up in the tax basis of assets, that will be recovered as those underlying assets are sold or the tax basis is amortized. 
 The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis and adjusts the valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In projecting its taxable income, the Company begins with historic results and incorporates assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that the Company uses to manage its business. The Company s projections of future taxable income that include the effects of originating and reversing temporary differences, including those for the tax basis intangibles, indicate that it is more likely than not that the benefits from our deferred tax assets will be realized. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has recognized a valuation allowance of million and million, respectively, which primarily relates to the Company s investment in the TPG Operating Group. In evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax asset related to the Company s investment in the TPG Operating Group, the Company determined that a portion of excess income tax basis in the TPG Operating Group will only reverse upon a sale of the Company s interest in the TPG Operating Group which is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s liability pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement related to the Reorganization and subsequent exchanges of TPG Operating Group partnership units for common stock was million and million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, certain holders of Common Units exchanged Common Units for an equal number of shares of Class A Common Stock as described in Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with these exchanges, the Company recorded an additional liability pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement of million, which is included in due to affiliates within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. and ) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and ) and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s effective tax rate is dependent on many factors, including the estimated amount of income subject to tax. Consequently, the effective tax rate can vary from period to period. The Company s overall effective tax rate in each of the periods described above deviates from the statutory rate primarily because (i) a portion of income and losses are allocated to non-controlling interests, and the tax liability on such income or loss is borne by the holders of such non-controlling interests and (ii) certain compensation expense that is not tax deductible. 
 Applicable accounting standards provide that the Company may estimate an annual effective tax rate and apply that rate to year-to-date income for each interim period. However, because the Company s forecast of income before taxes is highly variable due to changes in market conditions, the actual effective income tax rate for the year-to-date period represents a better estimate of the consolidated annual effective income tax rate. Accordingly, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the actual consolidated effective income tax rate was used to determine the Company s income tax provision.

 Investments in SPACs 
 The Company has invested in and sponsored SPACs which were formed for the purposes of effecting a merger, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other business combination. In the IPO of each of these SPACs, either common shares or units (which include one Class A ordinary share and, in some cases, a fraction of a redeemable public warrant which entitled the holder to purchase one share of Class A ordinary shares at a fixed exercise price) were sold to investors. Each SPAC provided its public shareholders the option to redeem their shares either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. Assets held in Trust Accounts related to gross proceeds received from the IPO and could only be used for the initial business combination and any possible investor redemptions. If the SPAC was unable to complete a business combination within a specified time frame, typically within 24 months of the IPO close date, the SPACs redeemed all public shares. The ownership interest in each SPAC which was not owned by the Company was reflected as redeemable equity attributable to Public SPACs in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As of August 16, 2023, the Company no longer had any investment in consolidated Public SPACs.

 Legal Actions and Other Proceedings 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings, litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our business, including with respect to acquisitions, bankruptcy, insolvency and other types of proceedings. Such lawsuits may involve claims against our portfolio companies that adversely affect the value of certain investments owned by TPG s funds. The Company s business is also subject to extensive regulation, which has and may result in the Company becoming subject to examinations, inquiries and investigations by various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the SEC, Department of Justice, state attorneys general, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. Such examinations, inquiries and investigations may result in the commencement of civil, criminal or administrative proceedings or fines against the Company or its personnel. 
 The Company accrues a liability for legal proceedings in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In particular, the Company establishes an accrued liability for loss contingencies when a settlement arising from a legal proceeding is both probable and reasonably estimable. If the matter is not probable or reasonably estimable, no such liability is recorded. Examples of this include: (i) the proceedings may be in early stages; (ii) damages sought may be unspecified, unsupportable, unexplained or uncertain; (iii) discovery may not have started or is incomplete; (iv) there may be uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions; (v) there may be significant factual issues to be resolved or (vi) there may be novel legal issues or unsettled legal theories to be presented or a large number of parties. Consequently, management is unable to estimate a range of potential loss, if any, related to such matters. Even when the Company accrues a liability for a loss contingency in such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. Loss contingencies may be, in part or in whole, subject to insurance or other payments such as contributions and/or indemnity, which may reduce any ultimate loss. 
 Based on information presently known by management, the Company has not recorded a potential liability related to any pending legal proceeding except as disclosed below, and is not subject to any legal proceedings that we expect to have a material impact on our operations, financial positions or cash flows. It is not possible, however, to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending legal proceedings, and the claimants in the matter discussed below seek potentially large and indeterminate amounts. As such, although we do not consider such an outcome likely, given the inherent unpredictability of legal proceedings, it is possible that an adverse outcome in the matter described below or certain other matters could have a material effect on the Company s financial results in any particular period. 
 Since 2011, a number of TPG-related entities and individuals, including David Bonderman and Jim Coulter, have been named as defendants/respondents in a series of lawsuits in the United States, United Kingdom, and Luxembourg concerning an investment TPG held from 2005-2007 in a Greek telecommunications company, known then as TIM Hellas Hellas ). Entities and individuals related to Apax Partners, a London based investment firm also invested in Hellas at the time, have been named in the suits as well. The cases all allege generally that a late 2006 refinancing of the Hellas group of companies was improper.

former TPG partners and individuals related to Apax involved in the investment has been decided after trial in their favor on all claims and is now on appeal. In February 2018, a High Court case in London against a number of TPG and Apax-related parties and individuals was abandoned by the claimants in the early days of a scheduled six-week trial with costs of million awarded to the TPG and Apax-related parties, of which million was awarded to TPG. 
 In addition to the Luxembourg appeal, there are several cases against TPG and Apax-related parties pending in New York state court. In one case, the Court granted and denied in part motions to dismiss by all defendants, paring back the parties, claims and amounts at issue, and appeals of that decision are pending. In a second case, the Appellate Division recently granted summary judgment to the TPG-related parties on the sole remaining claim in that case, and plaintiffs are seeking leave to appeal to New York s Court of Appeals. Finally, a third group of plaintiffs, similarly situated to those in the other cases, recently filed new claims seeking recovery from numerous TPG and Apax-related parties. The prior noted stayed federal actions have now been dismissed with prejudice by court order and stipulation. 
 The Company believes that the suits related to the Hellas investment are without merit and intends to continue to defend them vigorously. 
 In October 2022, the Company received a document request from the SEC focusing on the use and retention of business-related electronic communications, which, as has been publicly reported, is part of an industry-wide review. The Company is cooperating with the SEC s investigation and is in advanced discussions about a possible resolution. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded a contingent liability related to the matter.

 Trends Affecting our Business

 The U.S. market environment remained relatively constructive during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as inflationary pressures eased, the Federal Reserve began its long-awaited rate cutting cycle and economic data showed the domestic economy remained on relatively stable footing. 
 Inflation showed continued signs of moderating during the third quarter of 2024, progressing steadily towards the Federal Reserve s long-term target of 2.0 . The September reading of the U.S. Consumer Price Index CPI showed prices increased 2.5 over the prior twelve months, a slower rate of growth than the 3.0 level observed as of the end of the second quarter of 2024. Similarly core CPI, which excludes food and energy, fell to 3.2 annual growth as of the latest reading, down from 3.3 as of the end of the second quarter. 
 The U.S. September labor report showed hiring accelerated during the month and that the labor weakness experienced over the summer was not as weak as initially thought, fueling hopes the economy would achieve a soft landing . The September labor report showed the economy added 254,000 payrolls during the month, and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1 from 4.2 the month prior. 
 Progress on inflation and strength in the labor market led the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates during the quarter for the first time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. After holding target Federal Funds rate steady at 5.25 -5.50 at its July meeting, the Federal Reserve cut rates by 50 basis points during it September meeting, lowering the target Federal Funds range to 4.75 -5.00 . Quarterly projections released at the September meeting showed a narrow majority of Federal Reserve officials penciled in cuts that would lower rates by at least a quarter-point each at meetings to be held in November and December. 
 U.S. Treasury yields fell relatively sharply during the third quarter of 2024, with moves more pronounced towards the shorter end of the curve. Yields on the 10-Year Treasury fell 65 basis points relative to the end of the second quarter of 2024, closing the quarter at 3.88 . 2-Year Treasury yields fell approximately 111 basis points, ending the quarter at 3.64 . The 2-Year / 10-Year Treasury split normalized, with yields on the 10-Year Treasury eclipsing those of the 2-Year Treasury in September for the first time since 2022. 
 In corporate credit markets, both U.S. and European high yield generated positive performance in the third quarter of 2024. According to J.P. Morgan data, U.S. high yield gained 5.3 and the European market returned 3.3 during the three-month period. In the United States, high yield bond spreads tightened by 6 basis points to 345 basis points, approaching post-GFC lows, while in Europe, high yield spreads widened 9 basis points to end the quarter at 425 basis points. The high yield default rate, measured on a trailing twelve-month basis, declined modestly from 1.8 to 1.6 in the United States and from 2.8 to 2.7 in Europe. Additionally, the J.P. Morgan U.S. Leveraged Loan Index posted a 2.04 return, and the J.P. Morgan European Leveraged Loan Index posted a 1.93 return for the third quarter of 2024. From a spread and yield basis, the US Leveraged Loan Index ended the quarter at a yield of 7.75 and 452 basis point spread, while the European Leverage Loan Index ended the quarter at a yield of 7.19 and 493 basis point spread.

Table of Contents 

 When an entity is consolidated, we reflect the accounts of the consolidated entity, including its assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income, cash flows and other amounts, on a gross basis. While the consolidation of an entity does not impact the amounts of net income attributable to controlling interests, the consolidation does impact the financial statement presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). This is a result of the fact that the accounts of the consolidated entities being reflected on a gross basis, with intercompany transactions eliminated, while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items. The single line items in which the accounts attributable to third parties are recorded are presented as non-controlling interests on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 We are not required under U.S. GAAP to consolidate the majority of investment funds we advise in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements because we do not have a more than insignificant variable interest. Public SPACs are consolidated pursuant to U.S. GAAP in the relevant periods presented. Management fees and performance allocations from the consolidated Public SPACs are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The performance of the consolidated Public SPACs is not necessarily consistent with or representative of the aggregate performance trends of our TPG investment funds. 
 Key Financial Measures 
 
 Our key financial and operating measures are discussed below. 
 Revenues 
 Fees and Other . Fees and other consists primarily of (i) management fees, (ii) monitoring fees, (iii) transaction fees, (iv) incentive fee income and (v) expense reimbursements from unconsolidated funds, portfolio companies and third parties. These fee arrangements are documented within the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which generally coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. Monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. These termination payments are recognized in the period in which the related transaction closes. 
 Capital Allocation-Based Income (Loss) . Capital allocation-based income (loss) is earned from our funds when we have (i) a general partner s capital interest and (ii) performance allocations which entitle us to a disproportionate allocation of investment income or loss from investment funds. We are entitled to a performance allocation (typically 20 based on cumulative fund or account performance to date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. These performance allocations are subject to the achievement of preferred returns or high water marks, where applicable, in accordance with the terms set forth in the respective fund s governing documents. We account for our investment balances in the TPG funds, including performance allocations, under the equity method of accounting because we are presumed to have significant influence as the general partner or managing member; however, we do not have control as defined by ASC Topic 810, Consolidation . The Company accounts for its general partner interests in capital allocation-based arrangements as financial instruments under ASC Topic 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures as the general partner has significant governance rights in the TPG funds in which it invests which demonstrates significant influence. Accordingly, performance allocations are not deemed to be within the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). 
 Expenses 
 Compensation and Benefits . Compensation and benefits expense includes (i) cash-based compensation and benefits, (ii) equity based compensation and (iii) performance allocation compensation. Bonuses are accrued over the service period to which they relate. In addition, we have equity-based compensation arrangements that require certain TPG executives and employees to vest over a service period of generally one to five years, which under U.S. GAAP will result in compensation charges over current and future periods. In connection with our IPO and subsequent acquisition, we granted restricted stock units to executives and employees. Distributions of performance allocations in the legal form of equity made directly or indirectly to our partners and professionals are allocated and distributed, when realized, pro rata based on ownership percentages in the underlying investment partnership. These distributions were accounted for as distributions on the equity held by such partners rather than as compensation and benefits expense prior to the Reorganization and IPO and are now accounted for as performance allocation compensation.

Table of Contents 

 General, Administrative and Other . General and administrative expenses include costs primarily related to professional services, occupancy, travel, communication and information services and other general operating items. 
 Depreciation and Amortization . Depreciation and amortization of tenant improvements, furniture and equipment and intangible assets are expensed on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense includes interest paid and accrued on our outstanding debt and the amortization of deferred financing costs. 
 Expenses of Consolidated Public SPACs. Expenses of consolidated Public SPACs consist of interest expense and other expenses related primarily to professional services fees, research expenses, trustee fees, travel expenses and other costs associated with organizing and offering these entities. 
 Investment Income 
 Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities . Realized gains (losses) may be recognized when we redeem all or a portion of an investment interest or when we receive a distribution of capital. Unrealized gains (losses) result from the appreciation (depreciation) in the fair value of our investments. Fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods are primarily driven by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio and, to a lesser extent, the gains (losses) on investments disposed of during the period. The fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains (losses) from, our investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets. This impact affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. Upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains (losses) are reversed and an offsetting realized gain (loss) is recognized in the period in which the investment is sold. Since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. 
 Interest, Dividends and Other . Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected using the effective interest method. Dividends and other investment income are recorded when the right to receive payment is established. 
 Investment and Other Income of Consolidated Public SPACs. Investment and other income of consolidated Public SPACs include changes in the fair value of derivative contracts entered into by our consolidated Public SPAC entities, which are included in current period earnings and interest, dividend and other income earned by the consolidated Public SPACs. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The Company is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. We are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes, in addition to local and foreign income taxes, with respect to our allocable share of taxable income generated by the TPG Operating Group partnerships. 
 Non-Controlling Interests 
 For entities that are consolidated, but not 100 owned, a portion of the income or loss and corresponding equity is allocated to owners other than TPG. The aggregate of the income or loss and corresponding equity that is not owned by us is included in non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues 
 Revenues consisted of the following for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change in thousands) Management fees 410,773 278,965 131,808 47 Transaction, monitoring and other fees 53,129 31,614 21,515 68 Expense reimbursements and other 60,831 55,570 5,261 9 Total fees and other 524,733 366,149 158,584 43 Performance allocations 307,953 (200,079) 508,032 254 Capital interests 22,717 (5,715) 28,432 498 Total capital allocation-based income 330,670 (205,794) 536,464 261 Total revenues 855,403 160,355 695,048 433 
 Fees and other revenues increased by 158.6 million, or 43 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change resulted from a 131.8 million increase in management fees, a 21.5 million increase in transaction, monitoring and other fees and a 5.3 million increase in expense reimbursements and other. 
 Management Fees . Management fees increased by 131.8 million, or 47 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 This change was primarily driven by the addition of 133.4 million in management fees from TPG Angelo Gordon, acquired in November 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 83.5 million in fees from TPG AG Credit, largely driven by MVP Fund, MMDL IV and Credit Solutions II, and 49.9 million from TPG AG Real Estate, largely driven by the Realty Value XI, Realty Value X, Asia Realty V and Net Lease Realty IV. 
 Management fees from our Capital platform decreased 15.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change is primarily due to catch-up fees earned from Asia VIII and TPG IX during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a decrease in the fee basis of TPG VII resulting from the realization of portfolio investments. 
 Management fees from our Growth platform increased 6.9 million primarily due to increases from Growth VI, which was activated during the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by a decrease in fees from Growth V as a result of a step down in fee basis from committed to invested capital during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Management fees from our Impact platform decreased by 0.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Management fees from our Real Estate platform increased by 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Management fees from our Market Solutions platform increased 7.3 million, primarily from TGS as a result of additional fee earning capital raised during the three months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by a decrease in fees from TPEP as a result of a decrease in fee earning AUM. 
 Certain management fees totaling 15.0 million earned during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were considered catch-up fees as a result of additional capital commitments from limited partners. Catch-up fees primarily consisted of 10.3 million for TGS, which had its final close during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Transaction, Monitoring and Other Fees . Transaction, monitoring and other fees increased by 21.5 million, or 68 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily driven by a 10.1 million increase in our Market Solutions platform as a result of increased capital markets activity among our portfolio companies involving our broker-dealer. In addition, fee-related performance revenues increased by 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to TCAP which was acquired as part of the acquisition of TPG Angelo Gordon in November 2023. 
 Expense Reimbursements and Other . Expense reimbursements and other increased by 5.3 million, or 9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily due to the acquisition of TPG Angelo Gordon in November 2023. 
 Performance Allocations. Performance allocations increased by 508.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 (1) After the Reorganization, we retained an economic interest in performance allocations from the Growth III and Asia VI general partner entities, which entitles us to a performance allocation equal to 10 ; however, we allocate the full amount as performance allocation compensation expense. As such, net income available to controlling interest holders is zero for each of these funds following the Reorganization. 
 (2) The TPG Operating Group Excluded entities performance allocations are not a component of net income attributable to TPG following the Reorganization; however, the TPG general partner entities continue to be consolidated by us. We transferred the rights to the performance allocations the TPG Operating Group historically would have received to RemainCo on December 31, 2021. As such, net income available to controlling interest holders will be zero for each of the TPG Operating Group Excluded entities beginning January 1, 2022.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Distributable Earnings. Distributable Earnings DE is used to assess performance and amounts potentially available for distributions to partners. DE is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure of net income. DE differs from U.S. GAAP net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP in that it does not include (i) unrealized performance allocations and related compensation expense, (ii) unrealized investment income, (iii) equity-based compensation expense, (iv) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, or (v) certain other items, such as contingent reserves. 
 While we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the aforementioned U.S. GAAP income statement items provides investors with a meaningful indication of our core operating performance, the use of DE without consideration of the related U.S. GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described herein. This measure supplements U.S. GAAP net income and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP discussed further under Key Components of our Results of Operations Results of Operations prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 After-Tax Distributable Earnings . After-tax Distributable Earnings After-tax DE is a non-GAAP performance measure of our distributable earnings after reflecting the impact of income taxes. We use it to assess how income tax expense affects amounts available to be distributed to our Class A common stockholders and Common Unit holders. After-tax DE differs from U.S. GAAP net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP in that it does not include the items described in the definition of DE herein; however, unlike DE, it does reflect the impact of income taxes. Income taxes, for purposes of determining After-tax DE, represent the total U.S. GAAP income tax expense adjusted to include only the current tax expense (benefit) calculated on U.S. GAAP net income before income tax and includes the current payable under our Tax Receivable Agreement, which is recorded within due to affiliates and other liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Further, the current tax expense (benefit) utilized when determining After-tax DE reflects the benefit of deductions available to the Company on certain expense items that are excluded from the underlying calculation of DE, such as equity-based compensation charges. We believe that including the amount currently payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement and utilizing the current income tax expense (benefit), as described above, when determining After-tax DE is meaningful as it increases comparability between periods and more accurately reflects earnings that are available for distribution to shareholders. 
 We believe that while the inclusion or exclusion of the aforementioned U.S. GAAP income statement items provides investors with a meaningful indication of our core operating performance, the use of After-tax DE without consideration of the related U.S. GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described herein. This measure supplements U.S. GAAP net income and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP discussed further under Key Components of our Results of Operations Results of Operations. 
 Fee-Related Earnings . Fee-Related Earnings FRE is a supplemental performance measure and is used to evaluate our business and make resource deployment and other operational decisions. FRE differs from net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP in that it adjusts for the items included in the calculation of DE and also adjusts to exclude (i) realized performance allocations and related compensation expense, (ii) realized investment income from investments and financial instruments, (iii) net interest (interest expense less interest income), (iv) depreciation, (v) amortization, and (vi) certain non-core income and expenses. We use FRE to measure the ability of our business to cover compensation and operating expenses from fee revenues other than capital allocation-based income. The use of FRE without consideration of the related U.S. GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described herein.

 Fee-Related Revenues . Fee-related revenues FRR is a component of FRE. Fee-related revenues is comprised of (i) management fees, (ii) fee-related performance revenues, (iii) transaction, monitoring and other fees, net, and (iv) other income. Fee-related performance revenues refers to incentive fees from perpetual capital vehicles that are: (i) measured and expected to be received on a recurring basis and (ii) not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments. Fee-related revenues differs from revenue computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP in that it excludes certain reimbursement expense arrangements. Refer to Reconciliation to U.S. GAAP Measures to the comparable line items on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Fee-Related Expenses . Fee-related expenses is a component of FRE. Fee-related expenses differs from expenses computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP in that it is net of certain reimbursement arrangements and does not include performance allocation compensation. Fee-related expenses is used in management s review of the business. Refer to Reconciliation to U.S. GAAP Measures to the comparable line items on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Fee-related revenues and fee-related expenses are presented separately in our calculation of non-GAAP measures in order to better illustrate the profitability of our FRE. The use of fee-related revenues and FRE without consideration of the related U.S. GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described herein. 
 Our calculations of DE, FRE, fee-related revenues and fee-related expenses may differ from the calculations of other investment managers. As a result, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers.

 Management fees increased by 440.0 million, or 56 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 This change was primarily driven by the addition of 383.0 million in management fees from TPG Angelo Gordon, acquired in November 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 228.7 million in fees from TPG AG Credit, largely driven by MMDL IV, MVP Fund, Credit Solutions II and MMDL III, and 154.3 million from TPG AG Real Estate, largely driven by Realty Value XI, Realty Value X, Asia Realty V, Europe Realty IV and Net Lease Realty III. 
 Management fees from our Capital platform increased 44.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Management fees from our Growth platform increased 13.0 million mainly due to Growth VI, which was activated during the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by a decrease in fees from Growth V, which primarily resulted from a step down in fee basis from committed to invested capital during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Management fees from our Impact platform decreased 2.7 million, primarily attributable to Evercare, which had a step down in fee basis from committed to invested capital during the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by additional fees from TPG NEXT, which was activated during the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Management fees from our Real Estate platform decreased 9.1 million primarily due to TREP III, resulting from a step down in fee basis from committed to invested capital in the second quarter of 2023. 
 Management fees from our Market Solutions platform increased 11.3 million primarily due to TGS and NewQuest V as a result of additional fee earning capital raised during the last twelve months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by a decrease in fees from TPEP as a result of a decrease in fee earning AUM. 
 Certain management fees earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaling 47.9 million, were considered catch-up fees as a result of additional capital commitments from limited partners. Catch-up fees primarily consisted of 21.9 million for Asia VIII and 8.7 million for TGS.

 Unaudited Non-GAAP Balance Sheet Measures 
 Book assets, book liabilities and net book value are non-GAAP performance measures of TPG Operating Group s assets, liabilities and equity on a deconsolidated basis which reflects our investments in subsidiaries as equity method investments. Additionally, the book assets, book liabilities and net book value include the tax assets and liabilities of TPG Inc. We utilize these measures to assess the unrealized value of our book assets after deducting for book liabilities as well as assess our indirect interest in accrued performance allocations from our funds and our co-investments in our funds and third-party investments. We believe these measures are useful to investors as they provide additional insight into the net assets of the TPG Operating Group on a deconsolidated basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, similar financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of other alternative asset managers and, as a result, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Refer to Reconciliation to U.S. GAAP Measures for reconciliations of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition to the non-GAAP Balance Sheet. 
 The following table sets forth our non-GAAP book assets, book liabilities and net book value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net book value decreased primarily due to tax payments made on behalf of vested RSU recipients, RSU dividend equivalent payments, the amortization of intangibles and accretion of the contingent earnout related to the acquisition of Angelo Gordon. That decrease was offset by an increase in net accrued performance and investments in funds, primarily associated with TPG VII, TPG IX, Growth IV, Growth V, TPG AG Credit Solutions funds, and TPG AG Structured Credit Specialty Finance funds.

 AUM increased approximately 17.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This change was driven by capital raised of 21.3 billion and net increases in investment value of 13.6 billion, partially offset by realizations of 15.8 billion. Capital raised was primarily attributable to Asia VIII within the Capital platform, Growth VI within the Growth platform, Rise Climate II within the Impact platform, TGS within the Market Solutions platform, and MMDL V, Credit Solutions III and Essential Housing III within TPG AG Credit. These increases were partially offset by realizations of 15.8 billion primarily attributable to TPG VII, TPG VIII and Asia VII within the Capital platform, Growth IV within the Growth platform, Rise Climate I within the Impact platform, Credit Solutions II Dislocation A, Credit Solutions I and Credit Solutions II within TPG AG Credit and Asia Realty IV within TPG AG Real Estate. AUM also increased due to investment appreciation during nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Fee Earning Assets Under Management 
 Fee earning AUM FAUM represents only the AUM from which we are entitled to receive management fees. FAUM is the sum of all the individual fee bases that are used to calculate our management fees and differs from AUM in the following respects: (i) assets and commitments from which we are not entitled to receive a management fee are excluded (e.g., assets and commitments with respect to which we are entitled to receive only performance allocations or are otherwise not currently entitled to receive a management fee) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in our credit and real estate funds, have different methodologies for calculating management fees that are not based on the fair value of the respective funds underlying investments. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which we earn management fees. Our definition of FAUM is not based on any definition of AUM or FAUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds and products that we manage.

 (1) Fee Earning Capital Raised represents capital raised by our funds for which management fees calculated based on commitments or subscriptions were activated during the period. 
 (2) Net Change in Investment Activity includes capital called during the period, net of return of capital distributions and changes in net asset value of hedge funds. It also includes adjustments related to funds with a fee structure based on the cost or value of investments. 
 (3) Outflows represent redemptions and withdrawals. 
 (4) Reduction in Fee Base represents decreases in the fee basis for funds where the investment or commitment fee period has expired, and the fee base has reduced from commitment base to actively invested capital. It also includes reductions for funds that are no longer fee paying. 

FAUM increased approximately 4.7 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This change was driven by fee earning capital raised activity totaling 5.6 billion primarily attributable to the closing of Rise Climate II within the Impact platform, which had its initial close during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 FAUM increased from 136.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 to 141.7 billion as of September 30, 2024. This was driven by fee earning capital raised activity totaling 8.5 billion primarily attributable to the subsequent closings of Asia VIII within the Capital platform, which had its final close in April 2024, Growth VI within the Growth platform, which was activated during the fourth quarter of 2023, Rise Climate II within the Impact platform, which had its initial close during the third quarter of 2024, and TCAP within TPG AG Credit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, annualized weighted average management fees as a percentage of FAUM, which represent annualized management fees divided by the average of each applicable period s FAUM, were 1.17 .

 Net Accrued Performance 
 Net accrued performance represents both unrealized and undistributed performance allocations and fee-related performance revenues resulting from our general partner interests in investment funds that we manage. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it provides additional insight into the accrued performance to which the TPG Operating Group Common Unit holders are expected to receive. 
 The tables below summarize our net accrued performance by fund vintage year and platform as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 Net accrued performance was primarily driven by TPG VII, TPG VIII, Asia VII, Growth IV, Growth V and Rise I as of September 30, 2024 and TPG VII, TPG VIII, THP I, Asia VII, Growth IV, Growth V, Rise I, Rise II and Rise Climate I as of December 31, 2023. 
 We also utilize Performance Generating AUM and Performance Eligible AUM as key metrics to understand AUM that could produce performance allocations or fee related performance revenues. Performance Generating AUM refers to the AUM of funds we manage that are currently above their respective hurdle rate or preferred return, and profit of such funds are being allocated to, or earned by, us in accordance with the applicable limited partnership agreements or other governing agreements. Performance Eligible AUM refers to the AUM that is currently, or may eventually, produce performance allocations or fee-related performance revenues. All funds for which we are entitled to receive a performance allocation, incentive fee or fee-related performance revenue are included in Performance Eligible AUM. 
 Performance Generating AUM totaled 161.5 billion and 150.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Across the investment funds that we manage, Performance Eligible AUM totaled 205.2 billion and 191.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 AUM Subject to Fee Earning Growth 
 AUM Subject to Fee Earning Growth represents capital commitments that when deployed have the ability to grow our fees through earning new management fees (AUM Not Yet Earning Fees) or when management fees can be charged at a higher rate as capital is invested or for certain funds as management fee rates increase during the life of a fund (FAUM Subject to Step-Up). 
 AUM Not Yet Earning Fees represents the amount of capital commitments to TPG s funds and co-investment vehicles that has not yet been invested or considered active, and as this capital is invested or activated, the fee-paying portion will be included in FAUM. FAUM Subject to Step-Up represents capital raised within certain funds where the management fee rate increases once capital is invested or as a fund reaches a certain point in its life where the fee rate for certain investors increases. FAUM Subject to Step-Up is included within FAUM. 
 The table below reflects AUM Subject to Fee Earning Growth by platform as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 Capital Raised 
 Capital raised is the aggregate amount of subscriptions and capital raised by our investment funds and co-investment vehicles during a given period, as well as the senior and subordinated notes issued through our CLOs and equity raised through our perpetual vehicles. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it measures access to capital across TPG and our ability to grow our management fee base. 
 The table below presents capital raised by platform for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Capital raised totaled approximately 10.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This was primarily attributable to the fundraising activities of Rise Climate II within the Impact platform, TGS within the Market Solutions platform and Credit Solutions III within TPG AG Credit during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Capital raised totaled approximately 21.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was primarily attributable to the fundraising activities of Asia VIII within the Capital platform, Growth VI within the Growth platform, Rise Climate II within the Impact platform, TGS within the Market Solutions platform, and MMDL V, Credit Solutions III and Essential Housing III within TPG AG Credit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Available Capital 
 Available capital is the aggregate amount of unfunded capital commitments and recallable distributions that partners have committed to our funds and co-investment vehicles to fund future investments, as well as IPO and forward purchase agreement proceeds associated with our Public SPACs, and private investment in public equity commitments by investors upon the consummation of a business combination associated with our Public SPACs. Available capital is reduced for investments completed using fund-level subscription-related credit facilities. We believe this measure is useful to investors as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to our investment funds and co-investment vehicles to make future investments.

 __________ 
 Note: 
 Past performance is not indicative of future results. 
 NM signifies that the relevant data would not be meaningful. Performance metrics are generally deemed NM when, among other reasons, there has been limited time since initial investment. 
 Performance metrics generally exclude amounts attributable to the fund s general partner, its affiliated entities and friends-of-the-firm entities that generally pay no or reduced management fees and performance allocations. These metrics also represent an average of returns for all included investors and do not necessarily reflect the actual return of any particular investor. 
 Amounts shown are in U.S. dollars. 
 Unless otherwise noted, when an investment is made in another currency, (i) Capital Invested is calculated using the exchange rate at the time of the investment, (ii) Unrealized Value is calculated using the exchange rate at the period end and (iii) Realized Value reflects actual U.S. dollar proceeds to the fund. 
 (1) Vintage Year represents the year in which the fund consummated its first investment (or, if earlier, received its first capital contributions from investors). For platforms other than TPG Angelo Gordon, for consistency with prior reporting, however, the Vintage Year classification of any fund that held its initial closing before 2018 represents the year of such fund s initial closing. 
 (2) Capital Committed represents the amount of inception to date commitments a particular fund has received. Certain of our newer vintage funds are actively fundraising and capital committed is subject to change. 
 (3) Capital Invested represents cash outlays by the fund for its investments, whether funded through investor capital contributions or borrowing under the fund s credit facility. For TPG AG Credit funds, Capital Invested represents inception-to-date investor contributed capital net of returned contributions, excluding borrowings under the fund s credit facility. 
 (4) Realized Value represents total cash received or earned by the fund in respect of such investment or investments through the period end, including all interest, dividends and other proceeds. For TPG AG Credit funds, Realized Value represents inception-to-date capital distributed by the fund, including any performance distributions net of recalled distributions, if any. 
 (5) Unrealized Value, with respect to an investment in a publicly traded security, is based on the closing market price of the security as of the period end on the principal exchange on which the security trades, as adjusted by the general partner for any restrictions on disposition. Unrealized Value, with respect to an investment that is not a publicly traded security, represents the general partner s estimate of the unrealized fair value of the fund s investment. Unrealized Value, with respect to TPG AG Credit funds, represents the ending NAV for such fund, which is the period end ending capital balances of the investors and general partner. Valuations entail a degree of subjectivity, and therefore actual value may differ from such estimated value and these differences may be material and adverse. Except as otherwise noted, valuations are as of the period end. 
 (6) Total Value is the sum of Realized Value and Unrealized Value of investments. 
 (7) Gross IRR and Gross MoM represent investment level performance by the fund and incorporates the impact of fund level credit facilities, to the extent utilized by the fund. Gross IRR and Gross MoM are calculated by adjusting Net IRR and Net MoM to generally approximate investor performance metrics excluding management fees, fund expenses (other than interest expense and other fees arising from amounts borrowed under the fund s credit facility to fund investments) and performance allocations. Gross IRR is the discount rate at which (i) the present value of all Capital Invested in an investment or investments is equal to (ii) the present value of all realized and unrealized returns from such investment or investments. Gross IRR and Gross MoM for TPG AG Credit funds are calculated at the fund level and do not consider the impact of credit facilities and exclude fund expenses.

 (8) Net IRR represents the compound annualized return rate (i.e., the implied discount rate) of a fund, which is calculated using investor cash flows in the fund, including cash received from capital called from investors, cash distributed to investors and the investors ending capital balances as of the period end. Net IRR is the discount rate at which (i) the present value of all capital contributed by investors to the fund (which excludes, for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts borrowed by the fund in lieu of calling capital) is equal to (ii) the present value of all cash distributed to investors and the investors ending capital balances. 
 (9) Net MoM represents the multiple-of-money on contributions to the fund by investors. Net MoM is calculated as the sum of cash distributed to investors and the investors ending capital balances as of the period end, divided by the amount of capital contributed to the fund by investors (which amount excludes, for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts borrowed by the fund in lieu of calling capital). 
 (10) Total Return represents net performance data for investors (excluding certain classes/series with special fee arrangements), net of all expenses including actual quarterly management fees payable by the fund and the accrual of carried interest to the general partner. 
 (11) Unless otherwise specified, the fund performance information presented above for certain funds is, due to the nature of their strategy, as of June 30, 2024. 
 (12) Each Middle Market Direct Lending fund is comprised of four vehicles: onshore levered, onshore unlevered, offshore levered and offshore unlevered. Capital Committed, Capital Invested, Realized Value, Unrealized Value and Total Value for each fund are presented on a consolidated basis across the four vehicles. Performance metrics are presented only for the onshore levered vehicle of each fund. The Net IRRs and Net MoMs for TPG AG Middle Market Direct Lending funds on a consolidated basis were: (i) for the onshore unlevered vehicles, 7 and 1.3x, (ii) for the offshore levered vehicles, 10 and 1.3x and (iii) for the offshore unlevered vehicles, 7 and 1.2x. 
 (13) Japanese-Yen denominated fund. Commitments, Capital Invested and Realized Value are calculated using the exchange rate at the end of the quarter in which the relevant commitment was made or transaction occurred, as applicable. 
 (14) Includes Euro denominated fund entity with Commitments, Capital Invested and Realized Value calculated using the exchange rate at the end of the quarter in which the relevant commitment was made or transaction occurred, as applicable. Performance metrics only reflects capital committed in U.S. dollars, which represents the majority of capital committed to each fund. Net IRR and Net MoM were: (i) for the euro-denominated vehicle of Europe Realty III, 8 and 1.2x and (ii) for the euro-denominated vehicle of Europe Realty IV, NM and NM. 
 (15) These performance estimates represent the composite performance of TPG Public Equity Partners, LP and TPG Public Equity Partners Master Fund, L.P., adjusted as described below. The performance estimates are based on an investment in TPG Public Equity Partners, LP made on September 1, 2013, the date of TPEP s inception, with the performance estimates for the period from January 1, 2016 to present being based on an investment in TPG Public Equity Partners Master Fund, L.P. made through TPG Public Equity Partners-A, L.P., the onshore feeder. As of September 30, 2024, TPEP Long/Short had estimated inception-to-date gross returns of 174 and net returns of 127 . Gross performance figures (i) are presented after any investment-related expenses, net interest, other expenses and the reinvestment of dividends; (ii) include any gains or losses from new issue securities; and (iii) are adjusted for illustration purposes to reflect the reduction of a hypothetical 1.5 annual management fee. 
 (16) These performance estimates represent performance for TPEP Long Only and are based on an investment in TPEP Long Only made on May 1, 2019, the date of TPEP Long Only s inception, through TPG Public Equity Partners Long Opportunities-A, L.P., the onshore feeder. As of September 30, 2024, TPEP Long Only had estimated inception-to-date gross returns of 50 and net returns of 49 . Gross performance figures are presented after any investment-related expenses, a 1 annual management fee, net interest, other expenses and the reinvestment of dividends, and include any gains or losses from new issue securities. 
 (17) Total Return includes onshore investors participating directly through the master fund and investors through the offshore vehicle. Total Return for the offshore vehicle was 4 . 
 (18) Total Returns for onshore funds only. Total Returns for the offshore vehicles were: (i) for the MVP Fund, 11 , (ii) for ABC Evergreen, NM and (iii) for the Super Fund, 8 . 
 (19) TCAP launched on January 1, 2023. Total Return includes AGTB Private BDC, which commenced operations on May 10, 2022 and merged with TCAP on January 1, 2023. Total Return is calculated as the change in NAV per share during the period, plus distributions per share (assuming dividends and distributions are reinvested) divided by the beginning NAV per share. Inception-to-date figures for Class I, Class D, and Class S shares use the initial offering price per share as the beginning NAV. Total Return presented is for Class I and is prior to the impact of any potential upfront placement fees. An investment in TCAP is subject to a maximum upfront placement fee of 1.5 for Class D and 3.5 for Class S, which would reduce the amount of capital available for investment, if applicable. There are no upfront placement fees for Class I shares. Total Return has been annualized for periods less than or greater than one year. On July 28, 2023, TCAP completed its merger with AGTB where TCAP paid cash consideration for each share of common stock of AGTB. TCAP will continue as the surviving company. At the completion of the merger, AGTB s final Net IRR was 6.1 . 
 (20) The Rise Climate Global South Fund excludes a 500 million commitment 175 million of which was closed as of September 30, 2024) from ALT RRA Transformation LP made to a separate vehicle for purposes of deploying catalytic capital in connection with investments located in the Global South made by the Rise Climate II Fund and the Rise Climate Global South Fund.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have historically derived revenues primarily from third-party assets under management and have required limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of our business. We believe that our current sources of liquidity described below are sufficient to meet our projected capital needs and other obligations as they arise for at least the next 12 months. To the extent that our current liquidity is insufficient to fund future activities, we may need to raise additional funds. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the ownership of our existing investors will be diluted. The incurrence of additional debt financing would result in incremental debt service obligations, and any future instruments governing such debt could include operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total liquidity was 2,444.5 million, comprised of 1,164.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, excluding 13.3 million of restricted cash, as well as 1,200.0 million and 30.0 million of incremental borrowing capacity under the Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and the Subordinated Credit Facility (each as defined herein), respectively and 50.0 million under the 364-Day Credit Facility. Total cash of 1,177.8 million as of September 30, 2024 includes 261.0 million of cash that is attributable to the TPG Operating Group and on balance sheet securitization vehicles. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including: 
 cash generated by our operating activities, such as management fees, monitoring, transaction and other fees, realized capital allocation-based income and investment sales from our consolidated funds, 
 cash received from investing activities, including amounts received from notes receivable from affiliates, and 
 cash received from our financing activities, including cash and funds available under our credit facilities. 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
 Our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled approximately 1,177.8 million at September 30, 2024. 
 Credit Facilities 
 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility 
 In March 2011, TPG Holdings, L.P. entered into a 400.0 million credit facility (the Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility ). The Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, as amended May 2018, November 2020, November 2021, July 2022, August 2022 and September 2023, has aggregate revolving commitments of 1.2 billion and is scheduled to mature on September 26, 2028. 
 Dollar-denominated principal amounts outstanding under the Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest, at the option of the applicable borrower, either (i) at a base rate plus applicable margin not to exceed 0.25 per annum or (ii) at a term SOFR rate plus a 0.10 per annum adjustment and an applicable margin not to exceed 1.25 . We are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused commitments under the Amended Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility not to exceed 0.15 per annum, as well as certain customary fees for any issued letters of credit. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used the net proceeds from the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes to repay all the outstanding borrowings under the Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, 1,200.0 million was available to be borrowed under the terms of the Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.

 Senior Notes 
 On March 5, 2024, the Notes Issuer issued in an SEC-registered offering 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2034. The Senior Notes will mature on March 5, 2034, unless earlier accelerated, redeemed or repurchased. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of the Guarantors, and are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Notes Issuer and the Guarantors. The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.875 per annum. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 5 and September 5 of each year, beginning on September 5, 2024. The Senior Notes contain certain covenants as set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture and First Supplement Indenture, which, subject to certain limitations, restrict the ability of the Notes Issuer and, as applicable, the Guarantors to merge, consolidate or sell, assign, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially all of their combined assets, or create liens on the voting stock of their subsidiaries. 
 The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Notes and the payment of any Senior Notes guarantee will: 
 rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations of the Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, including indebtedness under the Amended Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Unsecured Term Loan Agreement; 
 rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations of the Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor; 
 be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and 
 be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations of each subsidiary of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor that is not itself the Notes Issuer or a Guarantor. 
 Subordinated Notes 
 On March 4, 2024, the Notes Issuer issued in an SEC-registered offering 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of Fixed-Rate Junior Subordinated Notes due 2064 (the Subordinated Notes ). The Subordinated Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.950 per annum. Interest on the Subordinated Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2024, subject to the Notes Issuer s right, on one or more occasions, to defer the payment of interest on the notes for up to five consecutive years. The Subordinated Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of the Guarantors, and are unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Notes Issuer and the Guarantors. The Subordinated Notes will mature on March 15, 2064, unless earlier accelerated, redeemed or repurchased. The Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at the Notes Issuer s option (i) in whole at any time or in part from time to time on or after March 15, 2029 at a redemption price equal to their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest, (ii) upon occurrence of a Tax Redemption Event, as defined in the Subordinated Notes First Supplemental Indenture, at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest or (iii) in whole, but not in part, at any time prior to March 15, 2029, upon the occurrence of a Rating Agency Event, as defined in the Subordinated Notes First Supplemental Indenture, at a price equal to 102 of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The Subordinated Notes contain certain covenants as set forth in the Subordinated Notes Indenture and First Supplemental Indenture, which, subject to certain limitations, restrict the ability of the Notes Issuer and, as applicable, the Guarantors to merge, consolidate or sell, assign, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially all of their combined assets, or create liens on the voting stock of their subsidiaries. 
 The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Subordinated Notes and the payment of any Subordinated Notes guarantee will: 
 be subordinate and rank junior in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Amended Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Unsecured Term Loan Agreement; 
 rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future parity indebtedness;

 be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and 
 be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations (including policyholder liabilities and other payables) of each subsidiary of the Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor that is not itself the Notes Issuer or a Guarantor. 
 As permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, we have excluded alternative financial disclosures for the Notes Issuer and Guarantors. Other than the guaranteed Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes and the associated interest expense, the Notes Issuer and Guarantors do not have any other material assets, liabilities or operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred interest expense of 36.5 million associated with the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes. For more information on our borrowings, see Note 8, Debt Obligations , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Senior Unsecured Term Loan 
 In December 2021, we entered into a credit agreement (the Senior Unsecured Term Loan Agreement pursuant to which the lenders thereunder agreed to make term loans in a principal amount of up to 300.0 million during the period commencing on December 2, 2021 and ending on the date that is 30 days thereafter. Unused commitments were terminated at the end of such period. The proceeds from the term loan were used to make a ratable distribution to each of our investors and are not available for our operations. The Senior Unsecured Term Loan Agreement, as amended in July 2022 and September 2023, is scheduled to mature on March 31, 2026. 
 Principal amounts outstanding under the amended Senior Unsecured Term Loan Agreement accrue interest, at the option of the borrower, either (i) at a base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.00 or (ii) at a term SOFR rate plus a 0.10 per annum adjustment and an applicable margin of 1.00 . 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used the net proceeds from the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes to repay all the outstanding borrowings under the Senior Unsecured Term Loan. 
 Secured Borrowings 
 Our secured borrowings are issued using on-balance sheet securitization vehicles. The secured borrowings are required to be repaid only from collections on the underlying securitized equity method investments and restricted cash of the securitization vehicles. The secured borrowings are separated into two tranches. Tranche A secured borrowings (the Series A Securitization Notes were issued in May 2018 at a fixed rate of 5.33 with an aggregate principal balance of 200.0 million due June 20, 2038, with interest payable semiannually. Tranche B secured borrowings (the Series B Securitization Notes or, collectively with the Series A Securitization Notes, the Securitization Notes were issued in October 2019 at a fixed rate of 4.75 with an aggregate principal balance of 50.0 million due June 20, 2038, with interest payable semiannually. The secured borrowings contain an optional redemption feature giving us the right to call the notes in full or in part, subject to a prepayment penalty if called before May 2023. If the secured borrowings are not redeemed on or prior to June 20, 2028, we will pay additional interest equal to 4.00 per annum. 
 The secured borrowings contain covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, default provisions and financial covenants and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants and conditions. 
 Subordinated Credit Facility 
 In August 2014, one of our consolidated subsidiaries entered into two 15.0 million subordinated revolving credit facilities (collectively, the Subordinated Credit Facility ), for a total commitment of 30.0 million. The Subordinated Credit Facility is available for direct borrowings and is guaranteed by certain members of TPG Operating Group. In August 2024, the subsidiary extended the maturity date of the Subordinated Credit Facility from August 2025 to August 2026. The interest rate for borrowings under the Subordinated Credit Facility is calculated at a term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR rate plus a 0.10 per annum adjustment and 2.25 . 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the subsidiary borrowed and made repayments of 30.0 million on the Subordinated Credit Facility, resulting in a zero balance outstanding at September 30, 2024.

 364-Day Credit Facility 
 On April 14, 2023, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company entered into a 364-day revolving credit facility (the 364-Day Credit Facility with Mizuho Bank, Ltd., acting as administrative agent, to provide the subsidiary with revolving borrowings of up to 150.0 million. Borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Facility are subject to one of three interest rates depending on the type of drawdown requested. Alternate Base Rate ABR loans are denominated in U.S. Dollars and subject to a variable interest rate computed daily as the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 or the one-month Term SOFR plus 1.00 , plus an applicable margin of between 1.00 and 2.00 , depending on the term of the loan. Term Benchmark Loans may be denominated in U.S. Dollars or Euros, and are subject to a fixed interest rate computed as the SOFR rate for a period comparable to the term of the loan in effect two business days prior to the date of borrowing, plus an applicable margin of between 2.00 and 3.00 , depending on the term of the loan. Risk-Free Rate RFR loans are denominated in Sterling and subject to a fixed interest rate computed daily as the Sterling Overnight Index Average SONIA in effect five business days prior to the date of borrowing, plus an applicable margin of between 2.00 and 3.00 , depending on the term of the loan. The subsidiary is also required to a pay a quarterly facility fee equal to 0.30 per annum of the total facility capacity of 150.0 million, as well as certain customary fees for any issued loans. 
 The Company entered into an equity commitment letter in connection with the 364-Day Credit Facility, committing to provide capital contributions, if and when required, to the consolidated subsidiary throughout the life of the facility. In April 2024, the consolidated subsidiary amended the 364-Day Credit Facility to extend the commitment termination date to April 11, 2025. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the subsidiary borrowed 230.0 million and made repayments of 130.0 million on the 364-Day Credit Facility, resulting in a 100.0 million balance outstanding at September 30, 2024.

 Contractual Obligations 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements that require future cash payments. The following table sets forth information regarding our anticipated future cash payments under our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

 __________ 
 (1) Debt obligations presented in the table reflect scheduled principal payments related to the Securitization Notes, Senior Notes, Subordinated Notes and 364-Day Credit Facility. 
 (2) Estimated interest payments on our debt obligations include estimated future interest payments based on the terms of the debt agreements. See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these debt obligations. 
 (3) Capital commitments represent our obligations to provide general partner capital funding to the TPG funds. These amounts are generally due on demand, and accordingly, have been presented as obligations payable in the 2024 column. We generally utilize proceeds from return of capital distributions and proceeds from secured borrowings to help fund these commitments. 
 Additional Contingent Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, if all investments held by the TPG funds were liquidated at their current unrealized fair value, there would be clawback of 62.8 million and 58.3 million, respectively, primarily related to STAR, net of tax, for which a performance allocation reserve was recorded within other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The potential liquidation of STAR could require clawback payments. Additionally, if all remaining investments were deemed worthless, a possibility management views as remote, the amount of performance allocations subject to projected clawback as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 would be 1,940.9 million and 1,910.2 million, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had guarantees outstanding totaling 100.6 million and 73.6 million, respectively, related to employee guarantees primarily related to a third-party lending program which enables certain of our eligible employees to obtain financing for co-invest capital commitment obligations with a maximum potential exposure of 189.7 million and 176.3 million, respectively. 
 
 Dividends 
 The table below presents information regarding the quarterly dividends on the Class A common stock, which were made at the sole discretion of our Executive Committee and Board of Directors.

 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 The future exchanges by owners of Common Units for cash from a substantially concurrent public offering, reorganization or private sale (based on the price per share of the Class A common stock on the day before the pricing of such public offering or private sale) or, at our election, for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis (or, in certain cases, for shares of nonvoting Class A common stock) are expected to produce or otherwise deliver to us favorable tax attributes that can reduce our taxable income. We (and our wholly-owned subsidiaries) are a party to a tax receivable agreement, under which generally we (or our wholly-owned subsidiaries) are required to pay the beneficiaries of the Tax Receivable Agreement 85 of the applicable cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we actually realize or, in certain circumstances, are deemed to realize as a result of the Covered Tax Items. We generally retain the benefit of the remaining 15 of the applicable tax savings. The payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are obligations of TPG Inc. (or our wholly-owned subsidiaries), and we expect that the payments we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. 
 Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, certain holders of Common Units, including certain partners and employees, are authorized to exchange Common Units for an equal number of shares of Class A common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, certain holders of Common Units exchanged Common Units for an equal number of shares of Class A common stock resulting in the issuance of shares of Class A common stock and the cancellation of an equal number of shares of Class B common stock for no additional consideration as follows: 
 
 Exchange Date Class A Common Stock Issued 
 2024 Exchanges (a) 
 February 27, 2024 17,704,987 May 21, 2024 1,998,593 August 19, 2024 1,042,119 2023 Exchange March 30, 2023 1,000,000 
 __________ 
 (a) The issuance of the shares of Class A common stock to such holders of Common Units was registered pursuant to the Company s registration statement on Form S-3 filed on November 2, 2023. 
 These exchanges resulted in an increase in our tax basis of our investment in the TPG Operating Group and is subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. We recognized an additional liability associated with the Tax Receivable Agreement in the amount of 230.8 million in connection with the exchanges.

 Net Cash Flows 
 The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 720,220 1,232,558 Net cash used in investing activities (43,002) (10,539) Net cash used in financing activities (177,769) (1,104,857) Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 499,449 117,162 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 678,371 1,120,650 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 1,177,820 1,237,812 
 Operating Activities 
 Operating activities provided 720.2 million and 1,232.6 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Key drivers consisted of performance allocation and co-investment proceeds totaling 843.2 million and 651.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This was partially offset by other changes in operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities used 43.0 million and 10.5 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities is primarily related to the payment of cash consideration to the sellers of Angelo Gordon as a result of post close net working capital adjustments and purchases of fixed assets. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily related to purchases of fixed assets. 
 Financing Activities 
 Financing activities used 177.8 million and used 1,104.9 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided from financing activities is primarily related to the Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes offerings, partially offset by repayment of our outstanding borrowings under our Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Unsecured Term Loan and by the payments of dividends and distributions to our Class A common stockholders and to holders of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects the payments of dividends and distributions to our Class A common stockholders and to holders of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries and the redemption of the outstanding YTPG and AFTR Class A Ordinary Shares, which was funded by our Assets held in Trust Account. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Regulation S-K. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There has been no material change to our critical accounting estimates disclosed in our Annual Report. We prepare our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We regularly assess these estimates; however, actual amounts could differ from those estimates. The impact of changes in estimates is recorded in the period in which they become known. For a description of our accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report and for a discussion of our policies and estimates, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our exposure to market risks primarily relates to our role as investment advisor or general partner to our TPG funds and the impact of movements in the underlying fair value of their investments. There was no material change in our market risks during the three months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the appropriate time periods, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 We, under the supervision of and with participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our business. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Industry Extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. Increased regulatory focus on the alternative asset industry or legislative or regulatory changes could result in additional burdens and expenses on our business in our Annual Report. We are not currently subject to any pending legal (including judicial, regulatory, administrative or arbitration) proceedings that we expect to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. However, given the inherent unpredictability of these types of proceedings, an adverse outcome in certain matters could have a material effect on TPG s financial results in any particular period. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the information under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
