FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, significant uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed, or implied, by those forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of the words may, will, should, could, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, intends, potential, proposed, or continue or the negative of those terms. These statements are only predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements.

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China and has spread throughout the United States and the rest of the world. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This contagious disease outbreak, which has not been contained, and is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a range of industries in United States and other companies as a result of quarantines, facility closures, and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak, as well as the worldwide adverse effect to workforces, economies, and financial markets, leading to a global economic downturn. Therefore, the Company expects this matter to negatively impact its operating results. However, the related financial impact and duration cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 3 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATION Quarter Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 Revenue for the Quarter ended September 30, 2024, was 0 compared to 12,912 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 12,912 or 100 .

Accordingly, mining activity was halted while operational changes were made. Our net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was 311,815 compared to a net loss of 345,760 during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The 33,945 decrease in the net loss is primarily attributable to a substantial decrease in stock-based compensation issued for services. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred operating expenses of 300,561 compared to 334,611 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in expenses was mainly due to a decrease in shares issued for services and an increase in management and consulting fees. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we incurred interest expenses of 11,254 compared to 1,894 incurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 As of September 30, 2024, our current assets were 207,429 and our current liabilities were 1,551,925, which resulted in a working capital deficit of 1,344,496.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows provided by financing activities were 201,623 compared to 147,306 for the same period in 2023. PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our proceeds from the sales of stock and generation of revenues from acquisitions. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. Our principal demands for liquidity are to increase business operations and for general corporate purposes. We intend to meet our liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to future business operations, and the expansion of our business, through cash flow provided by funds raised through proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity. 4 Table of Contents MATERIAL COMMITMENTS The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Raptor Mining, previously had contracts with two co-location cryptocurrency mining facilities.

PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT In anticipation of completing the acquisition of the Orofino ID facility, the Company has applied for lease financing for the purposes of securing 275 latest generation ASIC 270 terrahache miners over the next sixty days.

Our planned lease of these miners is subject to our financial ability to do so and/or to obtain equity financing to pay for the ASIC miners. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 5 Table of Contents GOING CONCERN As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of 311,815 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and had accumulated deficit of 7,335,613, and a working capital deficit of 1,344,496 as of September 30, 2024. While the Company is attempting to generate greater revenues, the Company s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect and there is a substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate revenues and raise capital. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. Under ASU No. 2023-08, effective December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, companies are required to mark bitcoin and similar digital assets to market at each reporting period. This guidance ensures the bitcoin holdings are recorded at fair market value, reflecting any unrealized gains or losses at the end of each period. The Company adopted this new accounting standard early, as of the quarter ending June 30, 2024, to enhance the transparency of its financial reporting. This adoption aligns with evolving regulatory practices surrounding digital assets and provides stakeholders with timely and relevant information on asset valuation. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based upon their evaluation of those controls and procedures performed as of the end of the periods covered by this report, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. MANAGEMENT S QUARTERLY REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 6 Table of Contents Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and, Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the 1992 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer believe that, as of March 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective based on those criteria, due to the following: Deficiencies in Segregation of Duties. Lack of proper segregation of functions, duties, and responsibilities with respect to our cash and control over the disbursements related thereto due to our very limited staff, including our accounting personnel. Deficiencies in the staffing of our financial accounting department. The number of qualified accounting personnel with experience in public company SEC reporting and GAAP is limited. This weakness does not enable us to maintain adequate controls over our financial accounting and reporting processes regarding the accounting for non-routine and non-systematic transactions. There is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused, or at least not be detected in a timely manner, by this shortage of qualified resources. In light of this conclusion and as part of the preparation of this report, we have applied compensating procedures and processes as necessary to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting. Accordingly, management believes, based on its knowledge, that (1) this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material face necessary to make the statements made not misleading with respect to the periods covered by this report, and (2) the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the years and periods then ended. This report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only Management s Report in this report. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 7 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
