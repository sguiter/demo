 discounts are treated as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfilment
 costs and presented in distribution, selling and administrative costs.

Legal
Proceedings 

Schreiber
Dispute 

The
Company s products are produced to its specifications through several contract manufacturers. One of the Company s contract
manufacturers (the Manufacturer provided approximately and of the Company s products in the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, under a Supply Agreement with an initial term through September 2025. 

Over
the course of 2022, the Company experienced numerous quality issues with the case packaging utilized by the Manufacturer. In addition,
in July of 2022, the Company began receiving customer complaints about the texture of the Company s smoothie products produced
by the Manufacturer. In response, the Company withdrew product from the market and destroyed on-hand inventory, withholding 
in payments due to the Manufacturer. 

The
Company attempted to resolve the issues based on the contractual procedures described in the Supply Agreement. However, on November 4,
2022, in response to a formal proposal of alternate resolutions, the Company received notification from the Manufacturer that it was
denying any responsibility for the defective manufacture of the product. In response, on November 10, 2022, the Company filed a complaint
in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Western Division (the Complaint ), claiming
that the Manufacturer had not met its obligations under the Supply Agreement, and seeking economic damages. In response, the Manufacturer
terminated the Supply Agreement. On January 20, 2023, the Company filed a voluntary dismissal of the Complaint which allowed the parties
to reach a potential resolution outside of the court system. However, as the parties were once again unable to come to an agreement,
the Company re-filed the Complaint in California State Court in August 2023 and continues to progress through the court system. 

In
May 2024, the Company entered into a non-recourse litigation financing arrangement which is expected to be adequate to pursue the Complaint
to conclusion. 

Due
to the uncertainties surrounding the claim, the Company is not able to predict either the outcome or a range of reasonably possible recoveries
that could result from its actions against the Manufacturer, and no gain contingencies have been recorded. The disruption in its supply
resulting from the dispute has and will continue to adversely impact the Company s results of operations and cash flow until a
suitable resolution is reached or new sources of reliable supply at sufficient volume can be identified and developed, the timing of
which is uncertain. The Company has mitigated the impact of the supply disruption with the introduction of its single-serve smoothie
cartons; however the product format has not been accepted by some customers or as a substitute for the bottle product in all use cases. 

Other
Legal Matters 

From
time to time, various lawsuits and legal proceedings may arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to
inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are

Equity
Incentive Plan 

Through
2022, the Company issued equity awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan and outside the Plan. In June
2023, the Company s stockholders adopted the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2023 Plan ), reserving shares
for future issuance. The Board of Directors discontinued further grants under the 2015 Plan. In March 2024, the Board of Directors amended
the 2023 Plan to reserve an additional shares for future issuance, bringing the total for the plan to , and to provide
an evergreen provision that reserves additional shares depending on future non-plan issuances of common stock.

In

the original grant-date fair value of approximately , resulting in incremental compensation of after considering the 
fair value of the vested shares at the date of the modification. Additionally, the Company performance targets were modified to allow
approximately PSUs to vest, with an additional time-based vesting requirement for approximately of the PSUs. Because the
awards did not vest based on the original terms, the modification was considered a new grant, resulting in in compensation expense
in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
Company adopted a 2024 PSU program in March 2024, granting approximately PSUs at target performance against company-wide and
individual performance metrics. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include and , respectively,
in expense for the 2024 PSU program. Estimates of expense associated with 2024 performance will be reassessed each quarter through the

. 

There
are open statutes of limitations for taxing authorities in federal and state jurisdictions to audit our tax returns from 2018 through
the current period. Our policy is to account for income tax related interest and penalties in income tax expense in the statement of
operations. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not incur any interest and penalties associated with tax
positions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions. 

in operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 
of working capital, including in cash and excluding in disputed co-manufacturer accounts payable (Note 4). 

The
Company has a history of negative cash flow and operating losses, which were expected to improve with growth. As described more fully
in Note 4, the dispute and subsequent contract termination with the Manufacturer has resulted in limitations in the Company s ability
to procure certain products necessary to achieve our growth projections and in elevated legal costs. 

To
mitigate the impact of procurement constraints, the Company built and paid for inventory in anticipation of third quarter seasonal requirements,
contributing to the cash used in operations in the first half of 2024. The inventory build allowed the Company to generate a
 increase in revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year quarter. Accounts receivable increased
with revenue by compared with September 30, 2023. The Company secured a receivables-based line of credit in August 2024 of ,
with available to borrow as of September 30, 2024. Management expects that the cash cycle will shorten as additional contracted
capacity commences production in the fourth quarter of 2024, offset by additional working capital necessary for further anticipated growth.
Additionally, in May 2024, the Company obtained non-recourse litigation financing to allow vigorous pursuit of the complaint against
the Manufacturer without further expense to the Company. 

Although
alleviated, the financial position at September 30, 2024 and historical results raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. As described, the Company has taken and partially completed steps to mitigate the dispute related issues.
Management believes that other potential actions are feasible, including raising additional financing and reducing growth-related expenditures.
While management cannot predict with certainty whether additional actions would achieve the predicted outcome, the availability of such
options, along with the actions already taken, resulted in the alleviation of the substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern.

Results
of Operations 

Results
of Operation for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue
and cost of revenue 

Revenue
increased 1,034,000, or 40 , to 3,637,000 in 2024 as compared to 2,603,000 in 2023. Our revenue in 2024 benefited from increased sales
of our bottled Twist Go smoothies due to improved availability resulting from inventory built over the months prior to the commencement
of the school year, continued acceptance of Twist Go smoothies provided in cartons, and improvements in bulk sales due to the reintroduction
of our WHIRLZ 100 juice product in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

We
have been able to expand our capacity on a limited basis at our existing smoothie bottle manufacturer and in July 2024 contracted with
an additional manufacturer. We expect expanded capacity to become available in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to the risks and uncertainties
associated with pre-production activities. 

Cost
of revenue increased 687,000, or 41 , to 2,377,000 in 2024 as compared to 1,690,000 in 2023. Cost of revenue increased at a slightly
higher rate compared to revenue due to 126,000 in cost incurred to relocate our single-serve smoothie pouch production line. 

Our
gross profit was 1,260,000 (35 and 913,000 (35 for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding production relocation costs, our gross
profit was 1,386,000 in 2024 (38 ). The improvement in gross margin is a result of favorable product mix, pricing actions, and a slight
improvement in the cost of supply chain components.

Sales
and marketing expense increased approximately 183,000 (56 from approximately 327,000 in 2023 to 510,000 in 2024. The increase is
a result of higher personnel cost, travel and broker commissions due to expansion of the broker network. 

Storage
and outbound freight expense increased approximately 110,000 (30 from approximately 370,000 in 2023 to 480,000 in 2024, lower than
the 40 rate of increase in revenue primarily because of freight efficiencies, and lower storage and inventory management cost in 2024.

General
and administrative expenses increased approximately 128,000 (22 from approximately 577,000 in 2023 to 705,000 in 2024. 

Personnel
cost represents the cost of employees including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits and employment taxes. Personnel cost increased
by approximately 116,000 (59 from approximately 196,000 in 2023 to 312,000 in 2024. The increase in personnel cost resulted
from the non-recurrence of the 2023 reversal of cash bonuses in favor of increased performance-based stock compensation in the third
quarter, increased head count and higher staff utilization, and resulting deferral of paid time off. Similarly, director fees paid
in cash decreased as a result of a shift to stock-based compensation in the third quarter of 2023. 

Stock-based
compensation decreased by approximately 61,000 (25 from 240,000 in 2023 to 179,000 in 2024 as a result of the aforementioned 2023
third quarter shift to performance-based stock-based compensation, partially offset by stock-based compensation associated with increased
headcount. 

Other
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 28,000 (29 due to increased information technology costs and the non-recurrence
of certain 2023 adjustments to estimates.

Net
loss 

We
had net losses of approximately 513,000 and 476,000 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The
increase in net loss of approximately 37,000, was primarily the result of operating expense increases of 384,000 due to headcount,
and variable freight and broker commission costs, partially offset by increased gross profit of 347,000 from our 40 increase in revenue. 

Results
of Operation for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue
and cost of revenue 

Revenue
increased 1,724,000, or 28 , to 7,929,000 in 2024 as compared to 6,205,000 in 2023. Our revenue in 2024 benefited from continued acceptance
of our carton packaging format, increased sales of our bottled Twist Go smoothies due to improved availability in the third quarter
of 2024, and improvements in bulk sales due to the reintroduction of our WHIRLZ 100 juice product in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Cost
of revenue increased 1,028,000, or 26 , to 4,991,000 in 2024 as compared to 3,963,000 in 2023. Cost of revenue increased at a lower
rate compared to revenue due to product mix and slight improvements in raw material and other input costs, partially offset by 176,000
in cost incurred to relocate our single-serve smoothie pouch production line. 

Our
gross profit was 2,938,000 (37 and 2,242,000 (36 for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding production relocation costs, our gross
profit was 3,114,000 in 2024 (39 ). The improvement in gross margin is a result of favorable product mix, pricing actions, and a slight
improvement in the cost of supply chain components.

Selling,
marketing and distribution expense increased approximately 277,000 (14 from approximately 1,990,000 in 2023 to 2,267,000 in 2024. 

Sales
and marketing expense increased approximately 148,000 (14 from approximately 1,058,000 in 2023 to 1,206,000 in 2024. The increase
is a result of higher personnel costs, travel and broker commission due to expansion of the broker network. Advertising and sample expense
were lower as a result of non-recurring costs in 2023 associated with the launch of our smoothie carton format offering. 

Storage
and outbound freight expense increased approximately 129,000 (14 from approximately 932,000 in 2023 to 1,061,000 in 2024, primarily
because of the 28 increase in revenue over the same period, partially offset by freight efficiencies, and lower storage and inventory
management cost in 2024.

General
and administrative expenses increased approximately 361,000 (18 from approximately 2,062,000 in 2023 to 2,423,000 in 2024. 

Personnel
cost decreased by approximately 13,000 (1 from approximately 929,000 in 2023 to 916,000 in 2024. The decrease in personnel cost
resulted from a reduction in headcount and cash bonus expense as a result of adopting an equity-only incentive structure in mid-2023,
partially offset by the non-recurrence of the recognition of a COVID-19 related Employee Retention Tax Credit in 2023. 

Stock-based
compensation increased by approximately 265,000 (61 from 431,000 in 2023 to 696,000 in 2024 as a result of the Company adopting
an equity-only structure for management incentives and Board of Directors compensation, implemented to conserve cash and to achieve compliance
with NASDAQ listing regulations. Increases in management headcount and the issuance of long-term incentive awards also contributed to
the increase. 

Other
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 84,000 (22 due to recruiting fees incurred to broaden the capabilities
of our management team, partially offset by a decrease in patent fees due to targeted renewals in 2024. 

Net
loss 

We
had net losses of approximately 1,973,000 and 2,123,000 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The decrease in net loss of approximately 150,000, was primarily the result an increase in gross profit of approximately 696,000, partially
offset by increased operating expense of 546,000 due to variable freight and broker commission costs, increased headcount, and the non-recurrence
of recognizing ERTC benefits in 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

On
June 1, 2021, we completed a private placement of 1,282,051 shares of our common stock at 4.68 per share, resulting in gross proceeds
of 6,000,000. In addition, holders of debt converted a total of 399,000 in principal and 234,000 in interest into 133,991 shares of
common stock and debt in the amount of 840,000 was retired, leaving the Company with no debt. 

From
July 2023 to March 2024, we executed subscription agreements for substantially all of a 2,000,000 privately placed convertible debt
offering. The debt was available to be drawn in 25 increments, maturing on the anniversary of the draw, bearing interest at 10 per
annum for the term, regardless of earlier payment or conversion, and was mandatorily convertible as to principal and interest into shares
of our common stock at any time prior to maturity at the greater of 1.20 or 85 of the volume-weighted average price of the common stock
for the ten trading days immediately preceding the written notice of the conversion (the Conversion Price ). If we had not
exercised the mandatory conversion, the holder of the debt had the option after six months and on up to four occasions to convert all
or any portion of the principal and interest into shares of our common stock at the Conversion Price. On October 23, 2023, we issued
 1,390,000 of convertible notes pursuant to the subscription agreements, and immediately converted 1,207,000 of principal and interest
into approximately 820,000 shares of common stock. Additionally, on December 19, 2023, we drew down 470,000 in convertible debt and
converted a total of 653,000 of principal and 4,000 of accrued interest into 495,331 shares of common stock. Finally, on March 27 and
29, 2024, we drew down 136,000 in convertible debt and converted the total drawn into 124,208 shares, settling all debt. 

17 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 1,544,000 in operations. Our net loss adjusted for non-cash operating expenses was
a loss of 982,000, while changes in non-cash current assets and liabilities consumed 562,000 primarily because of increased accounts
receivable resulting from our 40 increase in revenue compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, our accounts
payable decreased as we improved adherence with vendor terms. These changes were partially offset by a 444,000 reduction in inventory. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 1,371,000 compared with 2,345,000 at December 31, 2023, both excluding disputed accounts
payable of 499,000 resulting from our dispute with the Manufacturer. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to losses incurred
in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by capital raised in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 through the
sale of convertible notes and the conversion of those notes and other current liabilities to equity. 

Our
liquidity needs will depend on how quickly we are able to profitably ramp up sales, as well as our ability to control and reduce variable
operating expenses, and to continue to control fixed overhead expense. Our current dispute with the Manufacturer and the resulting loss
of product supply and legal expense have negatively impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flow. While the introduction
of our carton packaging format in 2023 has mitigated the loss of supply, the product offering has not been accepted by some customers
or as a substitute for the bottle product in all use cases. We have contracted with a co-manufacturer for additional smoothie bottle
manufacturing capacity. We expect expanded capacity to become available in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to the risks and uncertainties
associated with pre-production activities. Additionally, we have taken other measures to reduce our liquidity requirements, including
compensating our directors and employees with equity to reduce cash compensation requirements, obtaining non-recourse litigation financing,
and securing receivables financing in the third quarter of 2024. 

Our
operations to date have been financed by the sale of securities, the issuance of convertible debt and the issuance of short-term debt.
If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations with the capital raised we will be required to raise additional funds
either in the form of equity or in the form of debt. There are no assurances that we will be able to generate the necessary capital to
carry out our current plan of operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expense, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to stockholders. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not
required because we are a smaller reporting company. 

Item
4 . Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
Rule 13(a)-15(e). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be
disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act has been appropriately recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
on a timely basis and are effective in ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Through
2023, we had previously disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the control environment,
which was impacted by inadequate segregation of duties, including information technology control activities. 

18 

We
took actions to remediate the material weakness relating to our internal control over financial reporting, as described below. The controls
and processes we implemented to remediate the identified material weakness included: 

Implemented
 procedures to mitigate the lack of segregation of duties 

Retained
 additional information technology resources which bolstered control over data access and changes to operating systems 

As
a result of the remediation activities and controls in place as of September 30, 2024 described above, we have remediated this previously
disclosed material weakness. However, completion of remediation does not provide assurance that our remediated controls will continue
to operate properly or that our financial statements will be free from error. 

There
were no additional changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II- OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

As
described in Note 4, the Company has an on-going dispute with the Manufacturer, the outcome of which cannot be predicted at this time. 

From
time to time, various lawsuits and legal proceedings may arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to
inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are
currently the defendant in one legal proceeding for an amount less than 100,000. Our legal counsel and management believe a material
unfavorable outcome to be remote. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

Not
required because we are a smaller reporting company. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 22,266 shares of common stock for services valued at 97,300. 

The
Company relied upon the exemption from registration contained in Rule 506(b) and Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and corresponding

and existing debt holders, (ii) each offer was made through direct communication with the offerees by the Company, (iii) each of the
offerees, which included three directors of the Company, had the requisite sophistication and financial ability to bear risks of investing
in the Company s common stock, (iv) the Company provided disclosure to the offerees, and (v) there was no general solicitation
and no commission or remuneration was paid in connection with the offers.
