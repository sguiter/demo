FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than those that are purely historical are forward-looking statements. Words such as expect, anticipate, believe, estimate, intend, plan, project, and similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the following: 
 the potential impact of global economic conditions on the assumptions and estimates used when preparing the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements; 
 the impact of recent accounting pronouncements; 
 the timing of revenue recognition of upfront payments related to our credit card program agreement; 
 the timing of recognition in income of unrealized gains and losses from designated cash flow hedges; 
 the impact of losses due to indemnification obligations on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements; 
 the outcome of proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims, including the impact of such actions on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and our financial results; 
 meeting the closing conditions to transfer the Gap Taiwan operations; 
 our arrangements with third parties to operate stores and websites selling apparel and related products under our brand names; 
 maintaining and building upon financial and operational rigor, through an optimized cost structure and disciplined inventory management; 
 reinvigorating our brands to drive relevance and an engaging omni-channel experience; 
 strengthening and evolving our operating platform with a digital-first mindset to drive scale and efficiency; 
 energizing our culture by attracting and retaining strong talent; 
 continuing to integrate social and environmental sustainability into business practices to support long-term growth; 
 the expected impact of the Pillar Two rules on our fiscal 2024 effective tax rate and ongoing monitoring of related legislative action; 
 our ability to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our ABL Facility or other available market instruments; 
 the impact of the seasonality of our operations, in addition to the impact of global economic conditions, on certain cash inflows and outflows; 
 the ability of our cash flows from our operations, current balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, the Senior Notes and the ABL Facility, and other available market instruments to support our business operations and liquidity requirements; 
 the importance of our sustained ability to generate free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined and discussed in more detail in Part 1, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q below; 
 our dividend policy, including the potential timing and amounts of future dividends; and 
 the impact of changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
 Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or reputation: 
 the overall global economic and geopolitical environment, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts and recent elections in the United States, and impacts on consumer spending patterns; 
 social and political unrest in our sourcing countries, including Bangladesh, and disruptions to global trade and shipping capacity, including in the Red Sea; 
 the risk that we or our franchisees may be unsuccessful in gauging apparel trends and changing consumer preferences or responding with sufficient lead time; 
 the highly competitive nature of our business in the United States and internationally; 
 the risk that we may be unable to manage our inventory effectively and the resulting impact on our gross margins and sales; 
 the risk that our investments in customer, digital, and omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate; 
 the risk that we fail to maintain, enhance, and protect our brand image and reputation; 

the risk of loss or theft of assets, including inventory shortage; 
 the risk that we fail to manage key executive succession and retention or continue to attract qualified personnel; 
 reductions in income and cash flow from our credit card arrangement related to our private label and co-branded credit cards; 
 the risk that changes in our business strategy or restructuring our operations may not generate the intended benefits or projected cost savings; 
 the risk that trade matters could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us; 
 the risks to our business, including our costs and global supply chain, associated with global sourcing and manufacturing; 
 the risks to our reputation or operations associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct; 
 the risk that we or our franchisees may be unsuccessful in identifying, negotiating, and securing new store locations and renewing, modifying, or terminating leases for existing store locations effectively; 
 engaging in or seeking to engage in strategic transactions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties; 
 the risk that our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful; 
 the risk that our franchisees and licensees could impair the value of our brands; 
 the risk of data or other security breaches or vulnerabilities that may result in increased costs, violations of law, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of confidence in our security measures; 
 the risk that failures of, or updates or changes to, our IT systems may disrupt our operations; 
 the risk that our comparable sales and margins may experience fluctuations, that we may fail to meet financial market expectations, or that the seasonality of our business may experience fluctuations; 
 the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; 
 the risk that our level of indebtedness may impact our ability to operate and expand our business; 
 the risk that we and our subsidiaries may be unable to meet our obligations under our indebtedness agreements; 
 the risk that changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets; 
 natural disasters, public health crises (such as pandemics and epidemics), political crises (such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts), negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events; 
 evolving regulations and expectations with respect to ESG matters, including climate reporting; 
 the adverse effects of climate change on our operations and those of our franchisees, vendors, and other business partners; 
 our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations and changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape; 
 the risk that we will not be successful in defending various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims; 
 the risk that our estimates and assumptions used when preparing the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are inaccurate or may change; 
 the risk that changes in the geographic mix and level of income or losses, the expected or actual outcome of audits, changes in deferred tax valuation allowances, and new legislation could impact our effective tax rate, or that we may be required to pay amounts in excess of established tax liabilities; 
 the risk that changes in our business structure, our performance, or our industry could result in reductions in our pre-tax income or utilization of existing tax carryforwards in future periods, and require additional deferred tax valuation allowances; and 
 the risk that the adoption of new accounting pronouncements will impact future results. 
 Additional information regarding factors that could cause results to differ can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 and our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact net sales and profitability are difficult to predict. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of November 26, 2024. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized. 
 We suggest that this document be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024.

 Accounting Pronouncements 
 Except as noted below, the Company has considered all recent accounting pronouncements and concluded that there are no recent accounting pronouncements that may have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures, based on current information. 
 Accounting Pronouncement Recently Adopted 
 ASU No. 2022-04, Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations 
 In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued accounting standards update ("ASU") No. 2022-04, Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations. The ASU is intended to enhance the transparency of the use of supplier finance programs by requiring additional disclosures about the program s nature and potential magnitude, including a rollforward of the obligations and activity during the period. The ASU is effective retrospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The ASU does not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of supplier finance program obligations. We adopted the required guidance on January 29, 2023. See Note 12 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our supply chain finance program. 
 Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
 ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently assessing the impact that this ASU will have on the Company's disclosures. 
 ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU is intended to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, as well as income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact that this ASU will have on the Company's disclosures. 
 ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses 
 In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. The ASU is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring disaggregated disclosure of certain costs and expenses. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The ASU may be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis. We are currently assessing the impact that this ASU will have on the Company's disclosures.

 percent for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared with percent for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023. The increase is primarily due to changes in valuation allowances in the prior year. 
 The effective income tax rate was percent for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared with percent for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023. The increase is primarily due to tax benefits recognized in the prior year from a U.S. transfer pricing settlement related to our sourcing activities, changes in valuation allowances in the prior year, current year increases to certain income tax reserves, and changes in the amount and mix of jurisdictional earnings, partially offset by a favorable impact from stock-based compensation.

 OUR BUSINESS 
 We are a collection of lifestyle brands offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, and children under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta brands. We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Taiwan. Our products are available to customers online through Company-owned websites and through third-party arrangements. We also have franchise agreements to operate Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. In addition to operating in the specialty, outlet, online, and franchise channels, we use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores to further enhance our shopping experience for our customers. Our omni-channel services, including buy online pick-up in store, order-in-store, find-in-store, and ship-from-store, as well as enhanced mobile-enabled experiences, are tailored uniquely across our collection of brands. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Net Sales 
 See Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, for net sales disaggregation. 
 Comparable Sales ("Comp Sales") 
 Fiscal 2024 consists of 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2023. Due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, in order to maintain consistency, Comp Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 are compared to the 13 and 39 weeks ended November 4, 2023. 
 Comp Sales include the results of Company-operated stores and sales through our online channel. The calculation of Comp Sales excludes the results of the franchise and licensing business. 
 A store is included in the Comp Sales calculations when it has been open and operated by the Company for at least one year and the selling square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is included in the Comp Sales calculations on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which the selling square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from the Comp Sales calculations until the first day they have comparable prior year sales. 
 A store is considered non-comparable ("Non-comp") when it has been open and operated by the Company for less than one year or has changed its selling square footage by 15 percent or more within the past year. 
 A store is considered "Closed" if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or it is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non-comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year, the store will be in Non-comp status for the same days the following year. 
 Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp Sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison. 
 The percentage change in Comp Sales by global brand and for The Gap, Inc., as compared with the preceding year, is as follows: 
 13 Weeks Ended 39 Weeks Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Old Navy Global 1 3 (2) Gap Global 3 (1) 3 Banana Republic Global (1) (8) (8) Athleta Global 5 (19) 1 (13) The Gap, Inc. 1 (2) 2 (3)

Net Sales 
 Our net sales increased 62 million, or 2 percent, during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2023, driven primarily by an increase in online sales. Our net sales increased 346 million, or 3 percent, during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, driven primarily by an increase in Comp Sales.

 Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses decreased 1.4 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Cost of goods sold decreased 0.9 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily driven by disciplined inventory management. The impact of commodity costs was relatively flat for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Occupancy expenses decreased 0.5 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily driven by an increase in online sales without a corresponding increase in occupancy expenses. 
 Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses decreased 3.5 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. 
 Cost of goods sold decreased 2.8 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, primarily driven by lower commodity costs and improved promotional activity. 
 Occupancy expenses decreased 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, primarily driven by an increase in net sales without a corresponding increase in occupancy expenses.

 Operating expenses decreased 26 million, or 1.3 percentage points as a percentage of net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to a decrease in advertising expenses. 
 Operating expenses increased 5 million, but decreased 1.1 percentage points as a percentage of net sales during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, due to an increase in net sales as well as the following: 
 an increase in performance-based compensation; and 
 a gain on sale of building of 47 million that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2023; partially offset by 
 restructuring expenses of 89 million incurred during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 as a result of actions taken to simplify and optimize our operating model and structure; and 
 a decrease in advertising expenses.

 (29) (28) (80) (58) 
 Interest income increased slightly during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher cash balances, partially offset by a decrease in tax-related interest income. Interest income increased 22 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher cash balances and higher interest rates during the first half of fiscal 2024, partially offset by a decrease in tax-related interest income.

 The increase in the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2023 is primarily due to changes in valuation allowances in the prior year. 
 The increase in the effective tax rate for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 is primarily due to tax benefits recognized in the prior year from a U.S. transfer pricing settlement related to our sourcing activities, changes in valuation allowances in the prior year, current year increases to certain income tax reserves, and changes in the amount and mix of jurisdictional earnings, partially offset by a favorable impact from stock-based compensation. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") has introduced a new global minimum corporate tax of 15 , commonly referred to as Pillar Two. The rules, as they currently stand, did not have a material impact on the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 or for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and are not expected to have a material impact on our fiscal 2024 effective tax rate. We will continue to monitor U.S. and global legislative action related to Pillar Two for potential impacts. 
 19 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 In addition to our cash flows from operating activities, our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, our Senior Notes, and our ABL Facility. As of November 2, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1.97 billion and short-term investments of 250 million. We hold our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments across a diversified set of reputable financial institutions and monitor the credit standing of those financial institutions. In addition, we have issued 1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes, and are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our ABL Facility or other available market instruments. There were no borrowings under the ABL Facility as of November 2, 2024. See Note 4 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, for disclosures on the Senior Notes and ABL Facility. 
 Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from the sale of our merchandise. Our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases, lease and occupancy costs, personnel-related expenses, purchases of property and equipment, shipping costs, and payment of taxes. The seasonality of our operations, in addition to the impact of global economic conditions such as the uncertainty surrounding global inflationary pressures, acts of terrorism or war, global credit and banking markets, and the geopolitical landscape including new legislation and the potential impacts of recent elections, may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts as well as cash inflows and outflows between fiscal year-end and subsequent interim periods. 
 Our voluntary SCF program provides certain suppliers with the opportunity to sell their receivables due from us to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions. We are not a party to the agreements between our suppliers and the financial institutions and our payment terms are not impacted by whether a supplier participates in the SCF program. See Note 12 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, for disclosures on the Company's SCF program. 
 We believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, along with our cash flows from operations, and instruments mentioned above, provide sufficient funds for our business operations as well as capital expenditures, dividends, and other liquidity requirements associated with our business operations over the next 12 months and beyond. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 38 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, primarily due to the following: 
 Net Income 
 an increase in net income; 
 Non-cash item 
 an increase of 47 million due to a gain that occurred during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 resulting from the sale of a building; 
 Change in operating assets and liabilities 
 a decrease of 339 million related to merchandise inventory due to the seasonal increase in inventory during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared with no increase in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 due to an elevated opening balance of inventory. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities increased 373 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, primarily due to the following: 
 246 million of net purchases of short-term investments during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024; and 
 76 million in net proceeds from the sale of a building during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used for financing activities decreased 323 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, primarily due to 350 million for repayments of revolving credit facility borrowings during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. 
 20 

Free Cash Flow 
 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures. We require regular capital expenditures including technology improvements as well as building and maintaining our stores and distribution centers. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation. However, this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP results. 
 The following table reconciles free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure.

 870 832 Less: Purchases of property and equipment (330) (288) Free cash flow 540 544 
 Dividend Policy 
 In determining whether and at what level to declare a dividend, we consider a number of factors including sustainability, operating performance, liquidity, and market conditions. 
 We paid a dividend of 0.15 per share during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. In November 2024, the Board authorized a dividend of 0.15 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Share Repurchases

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s third quarter of fiscal 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 22 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims ("Actions") arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, securities, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance. 
 We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact operations in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. However, we do not believe that the outcome of any current Action would have a material effect on our financial results.
