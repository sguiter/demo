to years. The Company capitalizes the expenditures for major renewals and improvements
that extend the useful lives of property and equipment. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by a comparison
of their carrying amounts to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property, if any, exceeds its
fair market value. 

impairment recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023. 

Revenue
generated from the sale of INVOcell is typically recognized at the time the product is shipped, at which time the title passes to the
customer, and there are no further performance obligations.

million and million, respectively, and
has an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of June 30, 2024. Approximately million of the net loss was related
to non-cash expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

The
Company has been dependent on raising capital from debt and equity financings to meet its needs for cash used in operating and
investing activities. During the first six months of 2024, the Company received million
from the sale of preferred stock, million
from the exercise of warrants, million in net proceeds from the sale of notes, and 
million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock. Over the next 12 months, the Company s plan includes growing the
Wisconsin Fertility Institute and pursuing additional IVF clinic acquisitions. Until the Company can generate positive cash from
operations, it will need to raise additional funding to meet its liquidity needs and to execute its business strategy. As in the
past, the Company will seek debt and/or equity funding, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. 

Although
the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 were prepared under the assumption
that it would continue operations as a going concern, the report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm
that accompanies the Company s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a going concern qualification
in which such firm expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, based on the financial
statements at that time. Specifically, as noted above, the Company has incurred significant operating losses, and the Company expects
to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses as it continues to ramp up the commercialization of INVOcell and develop
new INVO Centers. These prior losses and expected future losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company s
financial condition. If the Company cannot continue as a going concern, its stockholders would likely lose most or all of their investment
in the Company. 

, of which was paid on the closing
date (net cash paid was after a holdback) plus assumption of the inter-company loan owed by WFRSA (as defined below)
in the amount of . The remaining three installments of each will be within ninety (90) days of the subsequent three anniversaries of
closing. The sellers have the option to take all or a portion of the final three installments in shares of the Company s common stock at a per
share value of , , and , for the second, third, and final installments, respectively. 

WFI
was comprised of (a) a medical practice, Wisconsin Fertility and Reproductive Surgery Associates, S.C., a Wisconsin professional service
corporation d/b/a Wisconsin Fertility Institute WFRSA ), and (b) a laboratory services company, Fertility Labs of Wisconsin,
LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company FLOW ). WFRSA owned, operated, and managed WFI s fertility practice that
provided direct treatment to patients focused on fertility, gynecology, and obstetrics care and surgical procedures, and employed physicians
and other healthcare providers to deliver such services and procedures. FLOW provided WFRSA with related laboratory services. 

The Company purchased the non-medical assets of WFRSA and one hundred percent
of FLOW s membership interests through Wood Violet. Concurrently, Wood Violet and WFRSA entered into a management services agreement
pursuant to which WFRSA outsourced all its non-medical activities to Wood Violet. As a result, post-closing, WFI is comprised of (a) WFRSA,
which only employs physicians to provide medical services, and (b) Wood Violet, which employs all other clinic personnel and provides all
non-medical services, including laboratory services. FLOW is no longer operational as its operations were absorbed by Wood Violet. 

The
Company s consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2024 include WFI s results of operations. The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the final purchase accounting adjustments in accordance with ASC
805 Business Combinations , whereby the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
upon their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.

within the 24-month period following the execution of the Bloom Agreement to support the start-up operations of the Georgia JV, the
Georgia JV issued 
of its units to INVO CTR and in consideration for Bloom s commitment to contribute physician services having an anticipated
value of up to 
over the course of a 24-month vesting period, the Georgia JV issued 
of its units to Bloom. 

The
responsibilities of Bloom include providing all medical services required for the operation of the Atlanta Clinic. The responsibilities
of INVO CTR include providing certain funding to the Georgia JV, lab services quality management, and providing access to and being the
exclusive provider of the INVOcell to the Georgia JV. INVO CTR also performs all required, industry specific compliance and accreditation
functions, and product documentation for product registration. 

The
Bloom Agreement provides Bloom with a profits interest in the Georgia JV and, in connection with such profits interest,
states that profits and losses be allocated to its members based on a hypothetical liquidation of the Georgia JV. In such a scenario,
liquidation proceeds would be distributed in the following order: (a) to INVO CTR until the difference between its capital contributions
and distributions equals ; (b) to Bloom until its distributions equal of the liquidation amounts distributed to INVO CTR (a catch-up 
to rebalance the distributions between members); and (c) thereafter on a pro rata basis. The Georgia JV had no assets or liabilities
at the time the units were issued, and, as of June 30, 2024, INVO CTR had made capital contributions greater than the net loss of the
Georgia JV. As such, the entire net loss was allocated to INVO CTR, and no loss was allocated to the noncontrolling interest of Bloom. 

The
Atlanta Clinic opened to patients on September 7, 2021. 

The
Company determined the Georgia JV is a VIE, and that the Company is its primary beneficiary because the Company has an obligation to
absorb losses that are potentially significant and the Company controls the majority of the activities that impact the Georgia JV s
economic performance, specifically control of the INVOcell and lab services quality management. As a result, the Company consolidated
the Georgia JV s results with its own. As of June 30, 2024, the Company invested million in the Georgia JV in the form of
capital contributions as well as million in the form of a note. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Georgia JV
recorded net losses of thousand and million respectively. Noncontrolling interest in the Georgia JV was .

On
March 10, 2021, INVO CTR entered into a limited liability company agreement with HRCFG, LLC HRCFG to establish a
joint venture, formed as HRCFG INVO, LLC (the Alabama JV ), for the purpose of commercializing INVOcell, and the
related IVC procedure, through the establishment of an INVO Center in Birmingham, Alabama (the Birmingham Clinic ). The Company also provides certain
funding to the Alabama JV. INVO CTR and HRSCGF party owns 
of the Alabama JV. 

The
Birmingham clinic opened to patients on August 9, 2021.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act ), that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2024 due solely
to the events that led to the restatements of our audited financial statements for the periods ending June 30, 2021 through June 30,
2024. As a result, management determined a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed due to the
accounting treatment of our right-of-use ROU asset and corresponding lease liability for our operating leases on our
balance sheet. Management s review was insufficient to identify an error in the incremental borrowing rate that led to our
restatement of our financial statements, as described in Note 2 to the Notes to Financial Statements included in this
Form 10-Q. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our
financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management
believes that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the period presented. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
