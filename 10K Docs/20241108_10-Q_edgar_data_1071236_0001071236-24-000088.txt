 This Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, which reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as may, should, could, predict, potential, believe, will likely result, expect, continue, will, anticipate, seek, estimate, intend, plan, projection, would, and outlook, or the negative version of those words, or such other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management s beliefs, and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 There are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 volatility and direction of market interest rates; 
 business and economic conditions generally, in the financial services industry, nationally, and within our local market areas; 
 government intervention in the U.S. financial system, including the effects of recent and future legislative, tax, accounting, and regulatory actions and reforms, including the Economic Aid Act, which established the SBA PPP, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and other stimulus legislation or changes in banking, securities, accounting, and tax laws and regulations, and their application by our regulators; 
 changes in management personnel; 
 increased competition in the financial services industry, particularly from regional and national institutions; 
 our ability to maintain important deposit customer relationships and our reputation, and to otherwise avoid liquidity risks; 
 factors that can impact the performance of our loan portfolio, including real estate values and liquidity in our primary market areas, the financial health of our commercial borrowers, and the success of construction projects that we finance, including any loans acquired in acquisition transactions; 
 changes in the value of collateral securing our loans; 
 risks associated with system failures or failures to protect against cybersecurity threats, such as breaches of our network security; 
 deterioration of our asset quality; 
 the adequacy of our reserves, including our ACL; 
 operational risks associated with our business; 
 natural disasters and adverse weather, acts of terrorism, pandemics, an outbreak of hostilities, including the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, as well as the current tensions with China, or other international or domestic calamities, and other matters beyond our control; 
 our ability to prudently manage our growth and execute our strategy; 
 compliance with the extensive regulatory framework that applies to us; 
 changes in the laws, rules, regulations, interpretations, or policies relating to financial institutions, accounting, tax, trade, monetary, and fiscal matters; and 
 the risk factors found in Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as in Part II - Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report and other reports and documents we file from time to time with the SEC. 
 The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in this Report. Additional information on these and other risk factors can be found in Part II - Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report and in Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what we anticipate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. New risks emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict what risks will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

 Securities AFS and Securities HTM 
 Securities AFS and securities HTM are debt securities. Securities AFS are held for indefinite periods of time and are carried at estimated fair value. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of securities AFS was million. The net unrealized loss on securities AFS decreased million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in a net unrealized loss of million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Securities HTM, which the Company has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost. As of September 30, 2024, the amortized cost of securities HTM was million. 
 Investment activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included million in maturities, principal repayments, and calls, partially offset by million of securities purchased. There were sales of securities AFS, and there were purchases or sales of securities HTM for the same period.

 Accounting for Credit Losses Securities AFS and Securities HTM 
 The Company evaluates securities AFS for impairment when there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Due to the zero credit loss assumption and the considerations applied to the securities AFS, there was ACL recorded for securities AFS as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Also, as part of the Company s evaluation of its intent and ability to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market, the Company considers its investment strategy, cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy, and interest rate risk position. Management does not intend to sell these securities prior to recovery, and it is more likely than not that the Company will have the ability to hold them, primarily due to adequate liquidity, until each security has recovered its cost basis. 
 Due to the zero credit loss assumption on the securities HTM portfolio, there was ACL recorded for securities HTM as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Accrued interest receivable totaled million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, for securities AFS and securities HTM and was reported in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets.

 Loan Modifications 
 Modifications are made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, and the modified terms are in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, or a term extension in the current reporting period. For the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, modifications were made to certain borrowers by granting term extensions. These term extensions were not significant to the consolidated financial statements. 

Credit Quality Indicators 
 Loans are categorized based on the degree of risk inherent in the credit and the ability of the borrower to service the debt. A description of the general characteristics of the Bank s risk rating grades follows: 
 Pass - These loans are of satisfactory quality and do not require a more severe classification. 
 Special mention - This category includes loans with potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan. However, the loss potential does not warrant substandard classification. 
 Substandard - Loans in this category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize normal repayment of principal and interest. Prompt corrective action is required to reduce exposure and to assure adequate remedial actions are taken by the borrower. If these weaknesses do not improve, loss is possible. 
 Doubtful - Loans in this category have well-defined weaknesses that make full collection improbable. 
 Loss - Loans classified in this category are considered uncollectible and charged-off to the ACL.

 Commitments to Extend Credit 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer if all conditions of the commitment have been met. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s evaluation of the customer s ability to repay. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unfunded loan commitments totaled approximately million and million, respectively. 
 Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 million and million, respectively. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. 
 Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the provision of ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method and established a reserve for unfunded commitments. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk through a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The reserve for unfunded commitments is recorded within accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, and the related provision is recorded in provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The loss rates computed for each pool and expected pool-level funding rates are applied to the related unfunded commitment balance to obtain the reserve amount. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the reserve on unfunded commitments was and , respectively.

 Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework 
 As part of the directive under the Economic Growth Act, in September 2019, the FDIC and other federal bank regulatory agencies approved the CBLR framework. This optional framework became effective January 1, 2020, and is available to the Company and the Bank as an alternative to the Basel III risk-based capital framework. The CBLR framework provides for a simple measure of capital adequacy for certain community banking organizations. Specifically, depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than 10.0 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a Tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9.00 , are considered qualifying community banking organizations eligible to opt into the CBLR framework and replace the applicable Basel III risk-based capital requirements.

 THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Company reported higher earnings, an improved net interest margin, and fairly consistent loans and deposits. We deployed excess funds into the securities portfolio and completed a significant stock repurchase. In mid-September, the target range of the federal funds rate was reduced by 50 bps. 
 Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 8.8 million, or 1.27 diluted EPS, an increase of 767,000, or 9.6 , compared to 8.0 million, or 1.16 diluted EPS, for the second quarter of 2024. Net income for the third quarter benefited from higher net interest income and an improved net interest margin FTE, along with higher noninterest income. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, the return on assets was 1.13 , and the return on equity was 11.11 . 
 Net interest income and net interest margin FTE increased for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter. Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 22.5 million compared to 21.8 million for the prior quarter. Net interest margin FTE for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.98 compared to 2.92 for the prior quarter. These increases were due to improved yields on securities and loans outpacing higher deposit rates. 
 Noninterest income totaled 5.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 321,000, or 6.3 , compared to 5.1 million for the previous quarter. Noninterest income benefited from the receipt of a 151,000 nonrecurring loan fee. 
 As of September 30, 2024, assets were 3.10 billion, which was 53.2 million, or 1.7 , higher than June 30, 2024. The increase was mainly due to a 30.5 million increase in deposits. 
 Deposits totaled 2.75 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 30.5 million, or 1.1 , compared to 2.72 billion as of June 30, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, customer deposit balances remained consistent, with normal activity. 
 As of September 30, 2024, loans HFI were 2.06 billion, slightly higher than 2.05 billion as of June 30, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, we closed on a high level of loan commitments, which should fund over time.

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, total securities were 697.7 million, which was 31.1 million, or 4.7 , higher than June 30, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, we redeployed cash flows from lower yielding securities into higher yielding securities, as well as deployed other liquid assets into the securities portfolio. 
 As of September 30, 2024, liquid assets, which are cash and cash equivalents, were 232.6 million, and the liquid assets to assets ratio was 7.50 . We do not have any borrowings, brokered deposits, or internet-sourced deposits. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the provision for credit losses totaled 300,000. This included 200,000 for loans and 100,000 for unfunded loan commitments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, NPAs were 3.1 million, or 0.10 of assets, and the ACL was 21.8 million, or 1.06 of loans HFI. 
 We paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0.09 per common share in the third quarter of 2024. 
 The 2024 stock repurchase program authorizes us to purchase up to 5.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, we entered into a privately negotiated stock repurchase agreement for the repurchase of 60,000 shares at an aggregate cost of 3.0 million. In connection with this repurchase, we reduced the availability under the 2024 stock repurchase program by 3.0 million. We also repurchased 233 shares at an aggregate cost of 11,000 from the open market. As of September 30, 2024, the 2024 stock repurchase program had 1.2 million remaining. 
 As of September 30, 2024, capital levels were strong with a stockholders equity to assets ratio of 10.46 , a leverage ratio of 11.90 , and a total risk-based capital ratio of 18.07 . 
 The book value per share of common stock was 47.51 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 44.58 as of June 30, 2024. This improvement was primarily due to the decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to securities and net income added to stockholders equity, partially offset by stock repurchases.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 8.8 million, or 1.27 diluted EPS, an increase of 767,000, or 9.6 , compared to 8.0 million, or 1.16 diluted EPS, for the second quarter of 2024. The increase in net income was due to a 670,000 increase in net interest income and a 321,000 increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a 161,000 increase in income tax expense and a 63,000 increase in operating expenses. The return on assets for the third quarter of 2024 was 1.13 , compared to 1.05 for the second quarter of 2024. The return on equity was 11.11 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 10.69 for the second quarter of 2024. Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2024 was 60.09 , compared to 62.07 for the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 24.9 million, or 3.59 diluted EPS, a decrease of 1.7 million, or 6.2 , compared to 26.6 million, or 3.70 diluted EPS, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was due to a 1.5 million increase in operating expenses, a 482,000 decrease in noninterest income, and a 415,000 increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by 463,000 increase in net interest income and a 240,000 decrease in income tax expense. The return on assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 1.08 , compared to 1.18 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The return on equity was 10.86 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.71 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our efficiency ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 60.84 , compared to 59.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin 
 Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income. Fluctuations in market interest rates impact the yield on interest-earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in the amount and type of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact our net interest income. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor: (1) yields on loans and other interest-earning assets; (2) the cost of deposits and other funding sources; (3) net interest spread; and (4) net interest margin. Since noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing funding sources. 
 In 2023, the interest rate environment trended upward. The FOMC increased the federal funds rate by 50 bps in the first quarter of 2023, by 25 bps in the second and third quarters of 2023, then kept the rate consistent through the second quarter of 2024. Late in the third quarter of 2024, the FOMC decreased the federal funds rate by 50 bps to a target range of 4.75 -5.00 . The average effective federal funds rate was 5.26 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 5.33 for the second quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average effective federal funds rate was 5.31 , compared to 4.92 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net interest income and net interest margin FTE increased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter. The net interest income increased and the net interest margin FTE decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Third Quarter of 2024 vs. Second Quarter of 2024 
 Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 22.5 million, which was 670,000, or 3.1 , higher than the second quarter of 2024, due to a 1.2 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a 550,0000 increase in interest expense. The increase in interest and dividend income was due to higher interest income on loans and securities. Loan income increased 1.0 million primarily due to higher rates on new and renewed loans compared to the existing portfolio. The average rate on new and renewed loans was 7.89 for the third quarter of 2024 and 7.98 for the prior quarter. Securities income increased 266,000 due to reinvesting lower yielding securities cash flows into higher yielding securities. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher rates on interest-bearing transaction deposits and time deposits. 
 The net interest margin FTE increased six bps to 2.98 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.92 for the prior quarter. This increase was due to improved yields on securities and loans, partially offset by higher deposit costs. The yield on securities increased 15 bps due to reinvesting lower yielding securities cash flows into higher yielding securities. The yield on loans increased 11 bps due to higher rates on new and renewed loans compared to the existing portfolio. The cost of deposits increased six bps to 1.81 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.75 for the previous quarter, primarily due to a nine bp increase in the rate on interest-bearing deposits during the third quarter, partially offset by our adjustment to certain transaction deposit rates late in the third quarter. 
 Late in the third quarter of 2024, the target range for the federal funds rate was reduced 50 bps to 4.75 -5.00 . At that time, we adjusted rates on transaction and time deposits, and we expect to continue lowering these rates in conjunction with future federal funds rate decreases. The market s expectation is that the FOMC will continue lowering the target federal funds rate in the fourth quarter of 2024. During the twelve months ending September 30, 2025, we anticipate receiving approximately 134.0 million in securities cash flows with an average yield of 2.86 , and we project approximately 194.2 million of fixed rate loans will mature with an average yield of 5.95 . We expect to redeploy these balances into higher yielding assets. Additionally, during the twelve months ending September 30, 2025, we expect 558.5 million of time deposits to mature with an average rate of 4.47 , which we anticipate repricing into lower cost deposits. As

 of September 30, 2024, floating rate loans were 14.9 of loans HFI, and floating rate transaction deposits were 7.2 of interest-bearing transaction deposits. Depending on balance sheet activity and the movement in interest rates, we expect the net interest income and net interest margin FTE to improve slightly in the fourth quarter of 2024.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 65.6 million, which was 463,000, or 0.7 , higher than 65.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income increased due to a 15.1 million increase in interest and dividend income, mostly offset by a 14.6 million increase in interest expense. 
 The increase in interest and dividend income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was mainly due to higher interest income on loans. Loan income increased 12.1 million primarily due to higher rates on new and renewed loans, combined with higher balances in loans HFI. The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due to an increase in deposit rates as we responded to deposit rate pressure, combined with larger balances in higher cost deposit accounts. During 2023, we experienced a change in the deposit mix due to customers moving deposits from lower yielding categories to higher yielding categories.

 Net interest margin FTE decreased two bps to 2.92 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.94 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the increase in the cost of deposits exceeding the increase in the yield on earning assets. The cost of deposits increased 70 bps to 1.75 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to a 94 bp increase in the rate on interest-bearing deposits, combined with customers moving deposits from lower yielding categories to higher yielding categories. Within total interest-bearing deposits, the rate on time deposits and interest-bearing transaction deposits increased 141 and 59 bps, respectively. These rates increased as we continued to respond to deposit rate pressure. However, late in the third quarter of 2024, we adjusted rates on certain transaction and time deposits in response to the federal funds rate decrease by the FOMC. 
 The net interest margin FTE was positively impacted by the increase in the yield on earning assets, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The yield on loans increased 53 bps due to higher rates on new and renewed loans due to the higher interest rate environment. The yield on securities increased 49 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to reinvesting lower yielding securities cash flows into higher yielding securities. In addition, the yield on short-term liquid assets increased 35 bps due to having a higher average federal funds rate in 2024 than in 2023.

 Rate/Volume Analysis 
 Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods presented. It distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and those due to changes in interest rates.

 (1) The change in interest attributable to rate has been determined by applying the change in rate between periods to average balances outstanding in the earlier period. The change in interest due to volume has been determined by applying the rate from the earlier period to the change in average balances outstanding between periods. Changes attributable to both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated to rate. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses is the amount necessary to maintain the ACL and the reserve for unfunded commitments at a level considered appropriate by management. Factors impacting the provision include loan portfolio growth, changes in the quality and composition of the loan portfolio, the level of nonperforming loans, delinquency and charge-off trends, the level of unfunded commitments, and current economic conditions. 
 The table below presents, for the periods indicated, the provision for credit losses: 
 For the Three Months Ended (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Increase (Decrease) Provision for credit losses 300 300 
 The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 300,000, which included 200,000 for loans and 100,000 for unfunded loan commitments. The provision for credit losses in the second quarter was 300,000 for loans. The provision in the second and third quarters was due to potential economic challenges resulting from the recent inflationary environment, changing monetary policy, and loan growth. In the third quarter of 2024, we had an increase in unfunded loan commitments. We will continue to evaluate future provision needs in relation to current economic situations, loan growth, trends in asset quality, forecasted information, and other conditions influencing loss expectations

Table of Contents 

 The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 900,000, an increase of 415,000, or 85.6 , from 485,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary drivers of the increase were the recent inflationary environment, changing monetary policy, current economic forecasts, loan growth, and an increase in unfunded loan commitments. Effective January 1, 2023, we adopted ASC 326 , the CECL methodology for estimating credit losses. For the cumulative effect of adopting ASC 326 , we recorded a 569,000, net of tax, decrease to stockholders equity as of January 1, 2023. No provision expense was recorded for the first quarter of 2023 under the new CECL methodology. 
 
 Noninterest Income 
 Our primary sources of noninterest income are fees related to the sale of mortgage loans, service charges on deposit accounts, debit card fees, brokerage income from advisory services, and other loan and deposit fees. 
 Third Quarter of 2024 vs. Second Quarter of 2024 
 Noninterest income increased 321,000 to 5.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.1 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase in noninterest income was mainly due to a gain on equity securities and increases in service charges on deposit accounts, loan and deposit income, and brokerage income, partially offset by a decrease in SBIC income. 
 The table below presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest income: 
 For the Three Months Ended (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Increase (Decrease) Noninterest income: Service charges on deposit accounts 1,486 1,367 119 8.7 Debit card income, net 905 949 (44) (4.6 Mortgage loan income 732 650 82 12.6 Brokerage income 987 893 94 10.5 Loan and deposit income 588 492 96 19.5 Bank-owned life insurance income 217 216 1 0.5 Gain (Loss) on equity securities 107 (13) 120 923.1 SBIC income 301 454 (153) (33.7 Other income (loss) 96 90 6 6.7 Total noninterest income 5,419 5,098 321 6.3 
 Equity securities are an investment in a CRA mutual fund consisting primarily of bonds. The gain or loss on equity securities is a fair value adjustment primarily driven by changes in the interest rate environment. Due to the fluctuations in market rates between quarters, equity securities had a gain of 107,000 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a loss of 13,000 for the previous quarter. 
 Service charges on deposit accounts increased 119,000 to 1.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the prior quarter, due to a larger number of non-sufficient fund transactions and related fee income in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Loan and deposit income increased 96,000 to 588,000 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the prior quarter. The third quarter of 2024 benefited from the receipt of a 151,000 nonrecurring loan fee. 
 Brokerage income increased 94,000 to 987,000 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the prior quarter. The higher income in the third quarter of 2024 was mainly due to increased investing activities by clients. Assets under management were 1.13 billion as of September 30, 2024, and 1.09 billion as of June 30, 2024. 
 SBIC income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 153,000 to 301,000, compared to the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily due to lower normal income received from these partnerships in the third quarter. We expect SBIC income to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Noninterest income decreased 482,000 to 15.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 15.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest income was mainly due to lower income from SBIC limited partnerships of which Red River Bank is a member, partially offset by higher mortgage loan income, a gain on equity securities, and higher net debit card income, brokerage income, and loan and deposit income.

 SBIC income decreased 1.4 million to 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 114,000 of distribution payments, in addition to normal income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received income from the sale of an investment, in addition to normal income. 
 Mortgage loan income increased 314,000 to 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period prior year mainly due to an increase in the average loan amount, which generated higher mortgage loan fee income. 
 Equity securities are an investment in a CRA mutual fund consisting primarily of bonds. The gain or loss on equity securities is a fair value adjustment primarily driven by changes in the interest rate environment. Due to fluctuations in market rates, equity securities had a gain of 63,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss of 145,000 for the same period prior year. 
 Debit card income, net, increased 188,000 to 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period prior year. In the first quarter of 2024, we terminated our previous debit card provider contract, which resulted in 145,000 of nonrecurring income. In January 2024, a newly negotiated debit card provider contract became effective, which resulted in an increase in debit card income. These increases were partially offset by higher debit card processing expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Brokerage income increased 108,000 to 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher investing activities by clients. Assets under management were 1.13 billion and 978.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Loan and deposit income increased 6,000 to 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period prior year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 201,000 of nonrecurring loan fees, which were offset by lower deposit fees due to changing customer deposit activity. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses are composed of all employee expenses and costs associated with operating our facilities, obtaining and retaining customer relationships, and providing services. 
 Third Quarter of 2024 vs. Second Quarter of 2024 
 Operating expenses increased 63,000 to 16.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 16.7 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase in operating expenses was due to higher technology expenses and other tax expenses.

 Technology expenses increased 141,000 to 865,000 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the prior quarter. This increase was primarily due to continued upgrades to our core banking systems and other software technology enhancements. 
 Other taxes increased 122,000 to 622,000 for the third quarter of 2024 , compared to the prior quarter. The second quarter benefited from the reversal of 145,000 of stock repurchase tax expense due to finalized guidelines. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating expenses increased 1.5 million to 49.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 47.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher personnel expenses, legal and professional expenses, technology expenses, other business development expenses, and occupancy and equipment expenses, partially offset by lower other taxes and loan and deposit expenses. 
 The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of operating expenses: 
 For the Nine Months Ended (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Increase (Decrease) Operating expenses: Personnel expenses 28,854 28,008 846 3.0 Non-staff expenses: Occupancy and equipment expenses 4,975 4,933 42 0.9 Technology expenses 2,298 2,066 232 11.2 Advertising 1,061 955 106 11.1 Other business development expenses 1,589 1,451 138 9.5 Data processing expense 1,650 1,689 (39) (2.3 Other taxes 1,859 2,042 (183) (9.0 Loan and deposit expenses 561 728 (167) (22.9 Legal and professional expenses 2,000 1,714 286 16.7 Regulatory assessment expenses 1,226 1,223 3 0.2 Other operating expenses 3,241 3,041 200 6.6 Total operating expenses 49,314 47,850 1,464 3.1

 changes, offset by a decrease in medical insurance expense. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we had 366 and 360 total employees, respectively. 
 Legal and professional expenses increased 286,000 to 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period prior year. This increase was due to higher contracted services, higher public company expenses, and higher professional and advisory services mainly related to a newly negotiated debit card provider contract effective January 2024. 
 Technology expenses increased 232,000 to 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period prior year. This increase was primarily due to implementing new software and 32,000 of nonrecurring expenses related to our new location in the New Orleans market. 
 Other business development expenses increased 138,000 to 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period prior year. This increase was mainly the result of an increase in CRA-related contributions, as well as higher marketing expenses. 
 Occupancy and equipment expenses increased 42,000 to 5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the same period prior year. This increase was primarily due to a full period of expenses related to properties that were expanded or opened in 2023 and 76,000 of nonrecurring expenses related to our new location in the New Orleans market and other 2024 property renovations. The same period prior year had 189,000 of nonrecurring expenses related to opening our new operations center building and the expansion of a banking center in the Southwest market. 
 Other taxes decreased 183,000 to 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in State of Louisiana bank stock tax resulting from lower deposit account balances and lower net income for the applicable tax years. 
 Loan and deposit expenses decreased 167,000 to 561,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period prior year. The nine months ended September 30, 2024, benefited from the receipt of a 262,000 negotiated, variable rebate from a vendor. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in total collection expenses. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amounts of our pre-tax income, tax-exempt income, and other nondeductible expenses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates in effect for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. 
 Our accrued tax rate is based on an annualized projection and changes considering our most recent financial results and balances. Our effective income tax rates have differed from the U.S. statutory rate due to the effect of tax-exempt income from loans, securities, life insurance policies, income tax effects associated with stock-based compensation, and permanent and temporary tax differences. 
 The table below presents, for the periods indicated, income tax expense: 
 For the Three Months Ended (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Increase (Decrease) Income tax expense 2,070 1,909 161 8.4 
 For the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, income tax expense totaled 2.1 million and 1.9 million, respectively. The slight increase in income tax expense was primarily due to a slight increase in pre-tax income. Our effective income tax rates for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, were 19.1 and 19.3 , respectively.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, income tax expense totaled 5.9 million and 6.2 million, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income. Our effective income tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 19.2 and 18.8 , respectively.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 As of September 30, 2024, assets were 3.10 billion, which was 27.1 million, or 0.9 , lower than 3.13 billion as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in deposits. Total deposits decreased 54.8 million, or 2.0 , to 2.75 billion as of September 30, 2024, from 2.80 billion as of December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents decreased 72.8 million, or 23.8 , to 232.6 million and were 7.50 of assets as of September 30, 2024. Total securities decreased 16.6 million, or 2.3 , to 697.7 million and were 22.49 of assets as of September 30, 2024. Loans HFI increased 63.2 million, or 3.2 , to 2.06 billion as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had no borrowings. Stockholders equity increased 20.5 million during the first nine months of 2024 to 324.3 million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the loans HFI to deposits ratio was 74.84 , compared to 71.13 as of December 31, 2023, and the noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposits ratio was 32.12 , compared to 32.71 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Interest-bearing Deposits in Other Banks 
 Interest-bearing deposits in other banks were the third-largest component of earning assets as of September 30, 2024. Excess liquidity that is not being deployed into loans or securities is placed in these accounts. As of September 30, 2024, interest-bearing deposits in other banks were 193.0 million and were 6.2 of assets, a decrease of 59.4 million, or 23.5 , compared to 252.4 million and 8.1 of assets as of December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the outflow of customer deposits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Securities 
 Our securities portfolio is the second-largest component of earning assets and provides a significant source of revenue. Securities are classified as AFS, HTM, and equity securities. As of September 30, 2024, our total securities portfolio was 22.5 of assets. It is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity, generate a favorable return on investments without incurring unnecessary interest rate and credit risk, and complement our lending activities. We may invest in various types of liquid assets that are permissible under governing regulations and approved by our investment policy, which include U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency obligations, certificates of deposit of insured domestic banks, mortgage-backed and mortgage-related securities, corporate notes having an investment rating of A or better, municipal bonds, and certain equity securities. 
 Securities AFS and Securities HTM 
 Securities AFS and securities HTM are debt securities. Total debt securities on the consolidated balance sheets were 694.7 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 16.6 million, or 2.3 , from 711.3 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Securities AFS are held for indefinite periods of time and are carried at estimated fair value. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of securities AFS was 560.6 million. The carrying values of our securities AFS are adjusted for unrealized gain or loss, and any unrealized gain or loss is reported on an after-tax basis as a component of AOCI in stockholders equity. The net unrealized loss on securities AFS decreased 12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in a net unrealized loss of 49.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to a net unrealized loss of 62.2 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Securities HTM, which we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost. As of September 30, 2024, the amortized cost of securities HTM was 134.1 million. Securities HTM had an unrealized loss of 17.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to an unrealized loss of 22.2 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Investment activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included 117.3 million in maturities, principal repayments, and calls, partially offset by 87.8 million of securities purchased. There were no sales of securities AFS, and there were no purchases or sales of securities HTM for the same period. 
 The securities portfolio tax-equivalent yield was 2.36 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.86 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in yield was primarily due to reinvesting lower yielding securities cash flows received between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, into higher yielding securities. 
 The contractual maturity of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations is not a reliable indicator of their expected lives because borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations at any time. Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are typically issued with stated principal amounts and are backed by pools of mortgage loans and other loans with varying maturities. The term of the underlying mortgages and loans may vary significantly due to the ability of a borrower to prepay. Monthly pay downs on mortgage-backed securities may cause the average lives of the securities to be much different than the stated contractual maturity. During a period of rising interest rates, fixed rate mortgage-backed securities are not likely to experience heavy prepayments of principal, and consequently, the average lives of these securities are typically lengthened. If interest rates begin to fall, prepayments may increase, thereby shortening the estimated average lives of these securities. As of September 30, 2024, the average

 life of our securities portfolio was 6.4 years with an estimated effective duration of 4.7 years. As of December 31, 2023, the average life of our securities portfolio was 7.1 years with an estimated effective duration of 5.0 years. 
 The following tables summarize the amortized cost and estimated fair value of our securities by type as of the dates indicated. As of September 30, 2024, other than securities issued by U.S. government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises, our securities portfolio did not contain securities of any one issuer with an aggregate book value in excess of 10.0 of our stockholders equity.

 Equity Securities 
 Equity securities are an investment in a CRA mutual fund, consisting primarily of bonds. Equity securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with periodic changes in value recorded through the consolidated statements of income. As of September 30, 2024, equity securities had a fair value of 3.0 million with a recognized gain of 63,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, equity securities had a fair value of 3.0 million with a recognized loss of 14,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Loan Portfolio 
 Our loan portfolio is our largest category of earning assets, and interest income earned on our loan portfolio is our primary source of income. We maintain a diversified loan portfolio with a focus on CRE, one-to-four family residential, and commercial and industrial loans. As of September 30, 2024, loans HFI were 2.06 billion, an increase of 63.2 million, or 3.2 , compared to 1.99 billion as of December 31, 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, loans HFI increased primarily due to new loan activity in various markets across Louisiana.

 CRE loans are collateralized by owner occupied and non-owner occupied properties mainly in Louisiana. Non-owner occupied office loans were 57.2 million, or 2.8 , of loans HFI as of September 30, 2024, and 62.3 million, or 3.1 of loans HFI, as of December 31, 2023. The properties are primarily centered in low-rise suburban areas. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the average CRE loan size was 947,000 and 938,000, respectively. 
 
 Industry Concentrations 
 Health care loans are our largest loan industry concentration and are made up of a diversified portfolio of health care providers. As of September 30, 2024, health care loans were 163.7 million, or 8.0 of loans HFI, compared to 153.8 million, or 7.7 of loans HFI, as of December 31, 2023. The average health care loan size was 399,000 as of September 30, 2024 and 334,000 as of December 31, 2023. Within the health care sector, loans to nursing and residential care facilities were 4.4 of loans HFI as of September 30, 2024, and 4.0 as of December 31, 2023. Loans to physician and dental practices were 3.4 of loans HFI as of September 30, 2024, and 3.6 as of December 31, 2023. 
 Energy loans were 1.6 and 1.7 of loans HFI as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Geographic Markets 
 As of September 30, 2024, Red River Bank operates in seven geographic markets throughout the state of Louisiana. The following table summarizes loans HFI by market of origin:

 Nonperforming Assets 
 NPAs consist of nonperforming loans and property acquired through foreclosures or repossession. Nonperforming loans include loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more and loans that are on nonaccrual status. Loans are considered past due when principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments are due. 
 Asset quality is managed through disciplined underwriting policies, continual monitoring of loan performance, and focused management of NPAs. There can be no assurance, however, that the loan portfolio will not become subject to losses due to declines in economic conditions, deterioration in the financial condition of our borrowers, or a decline in the value of collateral.

Table of Contents 

 NPAs totaled 3.1 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 504,000, or 19.4 , from 2.6 million as of December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in nonaccrual loans, partially offset by a decrease in past due loans. The ratio of NPAs to assets was 0.10 as of September 30, 2024, and 0.08 as of December 31, 2023.

 Potential Problem Loans 
 From a credit risk standpoint, we classify loans in one of five categories: pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss. Loan classifications reflect a judgment about the risk of default and loss associated with the loans. Classifications are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect the degree of risk and loss believed to be inherent in each loan. The methodology is structured so that reserve allocations are increased in accordance with deterioration in credit quality (and a corresponding increase in risk and loss) or decreased in accordance with improvement in credit quality (and a corresponding decrease in risk and loss). 
 Loans classified as pass are of satisfactory quality and do not require a more severe classification. 
 Loans classified as special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If these weaknesses are not corrected, repayment possibilities for the loan may deteriorate. However, the loss potential does not warrant substandard classification. 
 Loans classified as substandard have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize normal repayment of principal and interest. Prompt corrective action is required to reduce exposure and to assure adequate remedial actions are taken by the borrower. If these weaknesses do not improve, loss is possible. 
 Loans classified as doubtful have well-defined weaknesses that make full collection improbable. 
 Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged-off to the ACL.

 There were no loans as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, classified as doubtful or loss. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 In determining the ACL for loans HFI, we estimate losses on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics and risk profiles exist. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually and excluded from the collective evaluation. The ACL is determined using the CECL model, which considers relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the ACL was 21.8 million, or 1.06 of loans HFI. As of December 31, 2023, the ACL totaled 21.3 million, or 1.07 of loans HFI. The 421,000 increase in the ACL for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due to 800,000 from the provision for credit losses on loans, partially offset by 379,000 of net charge-offs. 
 The provision for credit losses on loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 800,000, an increase of 315,000, or 64.9 , from 485,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary drivers of the increase were the recent inflationary environment, changing monetary policy, current economic forecasts, and loan growth. Effective January 1, 2023, we adopted ASC 326 , the CECL methodology for estimating credit losses. For the cumulative effect of adopting ASC 326 , we recorded a 569,000, net of tax, decrease to stockholders equity as of January 1, 2023. We will continue to evaluate future provision needs in relation to current economic situations, loan growth, trends in asset quality, forecasted information, and other conditions influencing loss expectations.

 (1) The 900,000 provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, includes 800,000 for loans and 100,000 for unfunded loan commitments. 
 We believe that we have established our ACL in accordance with GAAP and that the ACL was adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the portfolio at all times shown above. Future provisions for credit losses on loans are subject to ongoing evaluations of the factors and loan portfolio risks, including economic pressures related to inflation, labor market and supply chain constraints, and natural disasters affecting the state of Louisiana. A decline in market area economic conditions, deterioration of asset quality, or growth in portfolio size could cause the allowance to become inadequate, and material additional provisions for credit losses could be required. 
 
 Deposits 
 Deposits are the primary funding source for loans and investments. We offer a variety of deposit products designed to attract and retain consumer, commercial, and public entity customers. These products consist of noninterest and interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and time deposit accounts. Deposits are gathered from individuals, partnerships, corporations, and public entities located primarily in our market areas. We do not have any internet-sourced or brokered deposits. 
 Total deposits decreased 54.8 million, or 2.0 , to 2.75 billion as of September 30, 2024, from 2.80 billion as of December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily a result of the seasonal outflow of funds from public entity customers and income tax payments, partially offset by an increase in new customer time deposit activity. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by 34.1 million, or 3.7 , to 882.4 million as of September 30, 2024. Noninterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits were 32.12 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 32.71 as of December 31, 2023. Interest-bearing deposits decreased by 20.7 million, or 1.1 , to 1.86 billion as of September 30, 2024.

 We manage our interest expense on deposits through a deposit pricing strategy that is based on competitive pricing, economic conditions, and current or anticipated funding needs. We adjust deposit rates in part based upon our anticipated funding needs and liquidity position. We also consider the potential interest rate risk caused by extended maturities of time deposits when adjusting deposit rates. 
 Our average deposit balance was 2.73 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was consistent with the three months ended June 30, 2024. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits and total deposits for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.71 and 1.81 , respectively, compared to 2.62 and 1.75 for the prior quarter, respectively. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits and total deposits in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior quarter was due to time deposit activity. Also, as of September 30, 2024, 7.2 of interest-bearing transaction deposits had floating rates, which adjust with market rates.

 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands) Average Balance Average Rate Average Balance Average Rate Noninterest-bearing demand deposits 901,192 0.00 908,930 0.00 Interest-bearing deposits: Interest-bearing demand deposits 127,798 4.20 113,466 4.27 NOW accounts 386,208 1.44 393,425 1.33 Money market accounts 547,883 2.34 550,767 2.29 Savings accounts 168,598 0.15 172,816 0.15 Time deposits 597,286 4.26 595,120 4.19 Total interest-bearing deposits 1,827,773 2.71 1,825,594 2.62 Total average deposits 2,728,965 1.81 2,734,524 1.75 
 As of September 30, 2024, our estimated uninsured deposits, which are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit (currently 250,000), were approximately 832.2 million, or 30.3 of total deposits, compared to 887.8 million, or 31.7 of total deposits, as of December 31, 2023. These amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes. Also, as of September 30, 2024, our estimated uninsured deposits, excluding collateralized public entity deposits, were approximately 674.8 million, or 24.6 of total deposits, compared to 643.6 million, or 23.0 of total deposits, as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents of 232.6 million combined with our available borrowing capacity of 1.69 billion equaled 231.3 of our estimated uninsured deposits and 285.2 of our estimated uninsured deposits, excluding collateralized public entity deposits. 
 The following table presents the amount of time deposits by account that are in excess of the FDIC insurance limit (currently 250,000) by time remaining until maturity for the period indicated: 
 (in thousands) September 30, 2024 Three months or less 46,942 Over three months through six months 28,118 Over six months through 12 months 14,195 Over 12 months 3,810 Total 93,065 
 
 Borrowings 
 Although deposits are our primary source of funds, we may, from time to time, utilize borrowings as a cost-effective source of funds when such borrowings can be invested at a positive interest rate spread for additional capacity to fund loan demand or to meet our liquidity needs. We established borrowing capacity with the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank s Discount Window facility, and other correspondent banks to provide additional sources of operating funds. Our FHLB line of credit is collateralized by eligible Red River Bank loans. Our Federal Reserve Bank s Discount Window line of credit is collateralized by eligible securities and eligible Red River Bank loans that are not pledged to the FHLB. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under these agreements. 
 
 Stockholders Equity 
 Total stockholders equity as of September 30, 2024, was 324.3 million compared to 303.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The 20.5 million, or 6.7 , increase in stockholders equity was attributable to 24.9 million of net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 10.9 million, net of tax, market adjustment to AOCI related to securities, and 316,000 of stock compensation, partially offset by the repurchase of 276,453 shares of common stock for 13.8 million and 1.9 million in cash dividends. 
 During the second quarter of 2022, we reclassified 166.3 million, net of 17.9 million of unrealized loss, from AFS to HTM. The securities were transferred at fair value, which became the cost basis for the securities HTM. At the date of the transfer, the net unrealized loss of 17.9 million, of which 14.2 million, net of tax, was included in AOCI and is being amortized over the remaining life of the securities as a yield adjustment in a manner consistent with the amortization or accretion of the original purchase premium or discount on the associated security. There were no gains or losses recognized as a result of the transfer. As of September 30, 2024, the net unamortized, unrealized loss remaining on the 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 transferred securities included in the consolidated balance sheets totaled 13.4 million, of which 10.6 million, net of tax, was included in AOCI. 
 On December 14, 2023, our board of directors approved the renewal of the 2023 stock repurchase program that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 after reaching its purchase limit. The renewed program authorizes us to purchase up to 5.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing prices and based on market conditions, or in privately negotiated transactions. 
 On March 13, 2024, we entered into a privately negotiated stock repurchase agreement for the purchase of 200,000 shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of approximately 10.0 million. This repurchase was supplemental to our 2024 stock repurchase program and did not impact the amount of permitted repurchases thereunder. 
 On August 8, 2024, we entered into a privately negotiated stock repurchase agreement for the purchase of 60,000 shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of approximately 3.0 million. This repurchase was supplemental to our 2024 stock repurchase program. However, in connection with the repurchase, we reduced the availability under our 2024 stock repurchase program by 3.0 million. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 233 shares of our common stock from the open market at an aggregate cost of 11,000 under the stock repurchase program. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 16,453 shares of our common stock from the open market at an aggregate cost of 775,000 under the stock repurchase program. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.2 million available for repurchasing our common stock under the 2024 stock repurchase program. 
 Effective January 1, 2023, repurchases are subject to a nondeductible excise tax under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 equal to 1.0 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased, subject to certain limitations. While we may complete transactions subject to the new excise tax, we do not expect a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 Capital management consists of maintaining equity and other instruments that qualify as regulatory capital to support current and future operations. Banking regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution s financial soundness. As a general matter, bank holding companies and FDIC-insured depository institutions are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. 
 As we deploy our capital and continue to grow our operations, our capital levels may decrease depending on our level of earnings. However, we expect to monitor and control our growth in order to remain in compliance with all regulatory capital standards applicable to us. 
 For additional information on regulatory capital guidelines and limits for Red River Bank and Red River Bancshares, Inc., see Item 1. Financial Statements - Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 8. Regulatory Capital Requirements. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT 
 
 Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had sufficient liquid assets available and 1.69 billion accessible from other liquidity sources. 
 Liquidity involves our ability to raise funds to support asset growth and potential acquisitions, reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations, maintain reserve requirements, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis and manage unexpected events. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the year ended December 31, 2023, liquidity needs were primarily met by core deposits, security and loan maturities, and cash flows from amortizing security and loan portfolios. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit outflows, mortgage prepayments, and prepayments on amortizing securities are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and the competitive environment in which we operate; therefore, these cash flows are monitored regularly. 
 Liquidity levels are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Access to purchased funds from correspondent banks and overnight advances from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta are also available. Purchased funds from correspondent banks and overnight advances can be utilized to meet funding obligations. 
 Our primary source of funds is deposits, and our primary use of funds is the funding of loans. We invest excess deposits in interest-earning deposit accounts at other banks or at the Federal Reserve, federal funds sold, securities, or other short-term liquid investments until the deposits are needed to fund loan growth or other obligations. Our average deposits 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 increased 16.3 million, or 0.60 , for the nine months ended of September 30, 2024, compared to the average deposits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The increase in average total deposits was primarily due to new time deposit activity, partially offset by the seasonal outflow of funds from public entity customers and income tax payments. Our average total loans increased 94.1 million, or 4.84 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to average total loans for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The increase in average total loans was primarily due to the increase in real estate and commercial and industrial activity. 
 As of September 30, 2024, liquid assets were 232.6 million, compared to 305.4 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease of 72.8 million, or 23.8 , was due to the outflow of deposits and the funding of loans, partially offset by net securities cash flows received during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The liquid assets to assets ratio was 7.50 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 9.76 as of December 31, 2023. 
 Our securities portfolio is an alternative source for meeting liquidity needs and was our second-largest component of assets as of September 30, 2024. The securities portfolio generates cash flow through principal repayments, calls, and maturities, and certain securities can be sold or used as collateral in borrowings that allow for their conversion to cash. Securities AFS can generally be sold, while securities HTM have significant restrictions related to sales. As of September 30, 2024, we project receipt of approximately 134.0 million of principal repayments and maturities through September 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 453.2 million, or 66.6 , of the securities portfolio was available to be sold or to be used as collateral in borrowings as a liquidity source. 
 We also utilize the FHLB as needed as a viable funding source. FHLB advances may be used to meet the Bank s liquidity needs, particularly if the prevailing interest rate on an FHLB advance compares favorably to the rates that would be required to attract the necessary deposits. We currently are classified as having blanket lien collateral status, which means that advances can be executed at any time without further collateral requirements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our net borrowing capacity from the FHLB was 989.8 million and 829.2 million, respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings from the FHLB as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Another borrowing source is the Federal Reserve Bank s Discount Window. Effective the third quarter of 2023, the Bank pledged securities to have borrowing access to the Federal Reserve Bank s Discount Window. In addition, effective March 2024, the Bank was approved for the Discount Window s Borrower-In-Custody BIC program, which provides borrowing capacity through the pledging of eligible Red River Bank loans that are not pledged to the FHLB. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total borrowing capacity of 154.0 million, including 113.6 million through the BIC program, compared to a total borrowing capacity of 45.5 million as of December 31, 2023. There were no outstanding borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank s Discount Window as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Other sources available for meeting liquidity needs include federal funds lines, repurchase agreements, and other lines of credit. We maintain four federal funds lines of credit with commercial banks that provided for the availability to borrow up to an aggregate of 95.0 million in federal funds as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The rates for the federal funds lines are determined by the applicable commercial bank at the time of borrowing. We also maintained an additional 6.0 million revolving line of credit at one of our correspondent banks until July 1, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total borrowing capacity of 95.0 million and 101.0 million, respectively, through these combined funding sources. We had no outstanding balances from either of these sources as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The Federal Reserve s Bank Term Funding Program ended on March 11, 2024. The Bank did not utilize this program while it was being offered. 
 
 Commitments to Extend Credit 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into certain financial instruments, such as commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of our customers. These commitments involve elements of credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. Some instruments may not be reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements until they are funded, although they expose us to varying degrees of credit risk and interest rate risk in much the same way as funded loans. 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer if all conditions of the commitment have been met. Commitments include revolving and nonrevolving credit lines and are primarily issued for commercial purposes. Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 501.2 million in unfunded loan commitments and 12.0 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2023, we had 372.0 million in unfunded loan commitments and 15.4 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit. As commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the total outstanding commitments may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.

 Investment Commitments 
 The Company is party to various investment commitments in the normal course of business. The Company s exposure is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. 
 In 2014, the Company committed to an investment into an SBIC limited partnership. As of September 30, 2024, there was a 226,000 outstanding commitment to this partnership. 
 In 2020, the Company committed to an additional investment into an SBIC limited partnership. As of September 30, 2024, there was a 2.6 million outstanding commitment to this partnership. 
 In 2021, the Company committed to an investment into a bank technology limited partnership. As of September 30, 2024, there was a 402,000 outstanding commitment to this partnership. 
 Purchase Commitment 
 The Company has committed to an agreement to buy real estate for approximately 1.9 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Construction Commitment 
 The Company has one committed construction agreement to construct a banking center, and there was approximately 85,000 remaining on this commitment as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk 
 As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our asset-liability management policies provide management with guidelines for effective funds management, and we have established a measurement system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. We have historically managed our rate sensitivity position within our established policy guidelines. 
 Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those that have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income. 
 We manage exposure to interest rates by structuring the balance sheet appropriately during the ordinary course of business. We have the ability to enter into interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk in limited circumstances, but it is not our policy to enter into such transactions on a regular basis. We do not enter into instruments such as financial options, financial futures contracts, or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk. We are not subject to foreign exchange risk, and our commodity price risk is immaterial, as the percentage of our agricultural loans to loans HFI was only 0.5 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by Red River Bank s Asset-Liability Management Committee. The committee formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk and monitors the results of those strategies. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the committee considers the impact on both earnings and capital given the current outlook on interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies, and other related factors. 
 The committee meets quarterly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and economic values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans, and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the committee reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits, and consumer and commercial deposit activity. We employ methodologies to manage interest rate risk, which include an analysis of relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as an interest rate simulation model and shock analysis. 
 In conjunction with our interest rate risk management process, on a quarterly basis, we run various simulations within a static balance sheet model. This model tests the impact on net interest income and fair value of equity from changes in market interest rates under various scenarios. We use parallel rate shock scenarios that assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario. We also deploy a ramped rate scenario over a 12-month and 24-month horizon based upon parallel yield curve shifts. Our nonparallel rate shock model simulation involves analysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the shape of the yield curve. Contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of loans are incorporated into the model, as are prepayment assumptions and maturity date and call options within the securities portfolio. The average life of non-maturity deposit accounts are based on assumptions developed from non-maturity deposit decay studies, which calculate average lives using historic closure rates. 
 Bank policy regarding interest rate risk simulations performed by our risk model currently specifies that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated net interest income at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than 10.0 for a 100 bp shift, 15.0 for a 200 bp shift, and 20.0 for a 300 bp shift. In accordance with

 Bank policy regarding economic value at risk simulations performed by our risk model for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated fair value of equity for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than 10.0 for a 100 bp shift, 20.0 for a 200 bp shift, and 30.0 for a 300 bp shift. 
 The following table shows the impact of an instantaneous and parallel change in rates, at the levels indicated, and summarizes the simulated change in net interest income and fair value of equity over a 12-month horizon as of the dates indicated. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change in Net Interest Income 
 Change in Fair Value of Equity 
 Change in Net Interest Income

 -100 0.4 2.0 (0.4 0.3 -200 (1.6 (0.2 (3.5 (1.4 -300 (4.4 (5.9 (7.6 (5.2 
 The results above, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, demonstrate that our balance sheet is asset sensitive, which means our assets have the opportunity to reprice at a faster pace than our liabilities, over the 12-month horizon. Our repricing opportunity is captured in a gap analysis, which is the process by which we measure the repricing gap between interest-rate sensitive assets versus interest rate-sensitive liabilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the reported percentage changes in net interest income and fair value of equity remained within the policy thresholds. These values are reported at each quarterly Asset-Liability Committee meeting. The net interest income at risk and the fair value of equity will continue to be monitored, and appropriate mitigating action will be taken if needed. 
 The impact of our floating rate loans and floating rate transaction deposits are also reflected in the results shown in the above table. As of September 30, 2024, floating rate loans were 14.9 of loans HFI, and floating rate transaction deposits were 7.2 of interest-bearing transaction deposits. 
 The assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain, and as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies and the slope of the yield curve. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. Certain financial measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance are discussed in this Report as supplemental non-GAAP performance measures. In accordance with the SEC s rules, we classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time in the U.S. 
 Management and the board of directors review tangible book value per share, tangible common equity to tangible assets, and realized book value per share as part of managing operating performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Report should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner that we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures that are discussed in this Report may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. It is important to understand how such other banking organizations calculate and name their financial measures similar to the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this Report when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Tangible Book Value Per Share . Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP measure commonly used by investors, financial analysts, and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. We calculate tangible book value per share as total stockholders equity, less intangible assets, divided by the outstanding number of shares of our common stock at the end of the relevant period. Intangible 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing tangible book value. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible book value per share is book value per share. 
 As a result of previous acquisitions, we have a small amount of intangible assets. As of September 30, 2024, total intangible assets were 1.5 million, which is less than 1.0 of total assets. 
 Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets . Tangible common equity to tangible assets is a non-GAAP measure generally used by investors, financial analysts, and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in the relative changes from period to period of tangible common equity to tangible assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Intangible assets have the effect of increasing both total stockholders equity and assets while not increasing our tangible common equity or tangible assets. We calculate tangible common equity as total stockholders equity less intangible assets, and we calculate tangible assets as total assets less intangible assets. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for tangible common equity to tangible assets is total common stockholders equity to total assets. 
 Realized Book Value Per Share. Realized book value per share is a non-GAAP measure that we use to evaluate our operating performance. We believe that this measure is important because it allows us to monitor changes from period to period in book value per share exclusive of changes in AOCI. Our AOCI is impacted primarily by the unrealized gains and losses on securities AFS. These unrealized gains or losses on securities AFS are driven by market factors and may also be temporary and vary greatly from period to period. Due to the possibly temporary and greatly variable nature of these changes, we find it useful to monitor realized book value per share. We calculate realized book value per share as total stockholders equity less AOCI, divided by the outstanding number of shares of our common stock at the end of the relevant period. AOCI has the effect of increasing or decreasing total book value while not increasing or decreasing realized book value. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for realized book value per share is book value per share. 
 The following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, stockholders equity to tangible common equity, stockholders equity to realized common equity, and assets to tangible assets, and presents related resulting ratios.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Report, an evaluation was performed by our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating our controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we, including our subsidiaries, are or may be involved in various legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, neither we, nor any of our subsidiaries, are involved in such legal proceedings that the resolution is expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, one or more unfavorable outcomes in these ordinary claims or litigation against us or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved. In addition, regardless of their merits or ultimate outcomes, such matters are costly, divert management s attention, and may materially and adversely affect our reputation or that of our subsidiaries, even if resolved favorably. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 For information regarding risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, see the information in Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Our purchases of shares of common stock made during the quarter are summarized in the table below: 
 (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program (1)(3) 
 July 1 - July 31, 2024 4,236 August 1 - August 31, 2024 (2)

 (1) On December 14, 2023, we announced that our board of directors approved the renewal of the 2023 stock repurchase program that was completed in the 
 fourth quarter of 2023 after reaching its purchase limit. The 2024 stock repurchase program has terms similar to the 2023 stock repurchase program and 
 authorizes us to purchase up to 5.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing prices and based on market conditions, or in privately negotiated transactions. 
 (2) On August 8, 2024, we entered into a privately negotiated stock repurchase agreement for the purchase of 60,000 shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of approximately 3.0 million. The repurchase was supplemental to the 2024 stock repurchase program. However, in connection with the repurchase, we reduced the availability under our 2024 stock repurchase program by 3.0 million. 
 (3) On November 5, 2024, we entered into a privately negotiated stock repurchase agreement for the purchase of 50,000 shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of approximately 2.5 million. The repurchase was supplemental to the 2024 stock repurchase program and did not impact the amount of permitted repurchases thereunder.
