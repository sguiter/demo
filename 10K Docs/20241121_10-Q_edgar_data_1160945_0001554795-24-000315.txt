FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC encourages reporting companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand future prospects and make
informed investment decisions. This report contains these types of statements. Words such as may, expect, 
 believe, intend, anticipate, estimate, project, or continue 
or comparable terminology used in connection with any discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking
statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
All forward-looking statements reflect our present expectation of future events and are subject to a number of important factors and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive Overview 

We have not recorded operational revenues since inception
and are dependent upon financing to continue basic operations. Management intends to rely upon advances or loans from management, significant
stockholders or third parties to meet our cash requirements, but we have not entered into written agreements guaranteeing funds and, therefore,
no one is obligated to provide funds to us in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going
concern. Our plan is to combine, through merger or acquisition, with an operating company to generate revenue. 

As of the date of this report, our management has
not had any discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that
is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without
established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations
of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may complete a business combination with
an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent
in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. Any business
combination or transaction may likely result in a significant issuance of shares and substantial dilution to present stockholders of the
Company. 

We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity
will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries
and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a
publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating
or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in
a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility
in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of securities. Potentially available business combinations
may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation
and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. 

If we obtain a business opportunity, then it may be
necessary to raise additional capital. We anticipate that we will sell our Common Stock to raise this additional capital. We expect that
we would issue such stock pursuant to exemptions to the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities laws. The purchasers
and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs and the available exemptions to the registration requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933. We do not currently intend to make a public offering of our stock. We also note that if we issue more shares
of our Common Stock, then our stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their Common Stock. 

9 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have not recorded
revenues from operations since inception and have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs.
We have relied primarily upon related parties to pay for our operating expenses. At September 30, 2024, we had cash of 2,916 compared
 to 17,265 cash at December 31, 2023. Our total liabilities increased to 503,997 at September 30,
2024, compared to 481,731 at December 31, 2023. The increase in total liabilities during the first quarter represents expenses paid by
related parties, proceeds from third party and related party notes payable and accrued interest. 

We intend to obtain capital from management, significant
stockholders and/or third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available.
Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity
and acquire or enter into a merger with such company. The type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our
profitability for the long term. 

During the next 12 months, we anticipate incurring
additional costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided
by management, significant stockholders and/or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance of our Common stock in lieu of cash to
convert debt or pay for expenses. 

Results of Operations 

We did not record revenues, from operations, in either
the nine months ended September 30,2024 or 2023. We recorded 18,849 in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 (the 2024 Nine-Month Period compared to 11,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (the 2023
Nine-Month Period ). We recorded 4,848 in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (the
 2024 Third Quarter compared to 2,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (the 2023 Third Quarter ). 

Total other expense increased to 17,766 for the 2024
Nine-Month Period compared to 16,225 for the 2023 Nine-Month Period. Total other expense increased to 5,922 for the 2024 Third Quarter
compared to 5,519 for the 2023 Third Quarter. Total other expense represents interest expense on notes payable and notes payable 
related party. 

Our net loss increased to 36,615 for the 2024 Nine-Month
Period compared to 27,725 for the 2023 Nine-Month Period. Net loss for the 2024 Third Quarter increased to 10,770 compared to 8,419
for the 2023 Third Quarter. Management expects net losses to continue until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity. 

Commitments and Obligations 

During the 2024 Nine-Month Period a shareholder-related
party loaned the Company 0. At September 30, 2024, we owed notes payable of 109,726 and notes payable related party of 186,350
representing services received, as well as cash advances received. All of the notes payable are non-collateralized, carry interest at
8 and are due on demand. Total accrued interest as of September 30, 2024, on all notes payable was 197,421. 

During the 2024 Nine-Month Period a shareholder paid
for or performed professional services totaling 3,000. At September 30, 2024, we owe the shareholder an aggregate of 1,200 in accounts
payable related party. 

At September 30, 2024, two lenders represent in excess
of 95 of the Company s accounts payable and notes payable. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term
is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). A company qualifies as an emerging growth company
if it has total annual gross revenues of less than 1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year and, as of December 8,
2011, had not sold common equity securities under a registration statement. Under the JOBS Act we are permitted to, and intend to, rely
on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides
that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits
of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such
new or revised accounting standards.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms
of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President,
who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure
the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to remediate this deficiency
until we acquire or merge with another company. 

Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
Act). Management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and determined that there were no changes made
in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, 
 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control
over financial reporting.
