 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an accumulated deficit of billion as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, million in marketable securities, an million outstanding balance on its Credit Line (as defined in Note 10, Debt including accrued interest and million of outstanding principal on its Convertible Senior Notes (the Convertible Notes ). The Company is required to maintain a minimum of at least million in its UBS accounts as collateral for its Credit Line. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million remaining and available on its Credit Line. While the Company has introduced multiple products that are generating revenues, these revenues have not been sufficient to fund all operations and business plans. Accordingly, the Company has funded the portion of operating costs that exceeds revenues through a combination of equity issuances, debt issuances, and other financings. The Company continues to invest in the development and commercialization of its existing and future products and, consequently, it will need to generate additional revenues to achieve future profitability and may need to raise additional equity or debt financing. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, its stockholders will experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting its operations or its ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that the Company raises may contain terms that are not favorable to it or its stockholders and requires significant debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. Additional financing may not be available when necessary, or in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing, it may be required to delay the development and commercialization of its products and significantly scale back its business and operations. On July 19, 2024, the Company announced its decision to redeem all of its outstanding Convertible Senior Notes due 2027. The redemption was completed on October 11, 2024 (the Redemption Date ). The redemption price for the Convertible Notes equaled of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. The Company elected physical settlement with shares of its common stock as the settlement method to apply to all conversions of the Convertible Notes. On the Redemption Date, million of Convertible Notes were redeemed for approximately million shares of the Company s common stock under the terms of the redemption notice. The remaining Convertible Notes not redeemed under the redemption notice were converted in exchange for cash at face value plus any accrued interest totaling million. As such, the Company s redemption of its Convertible Notes did not have a material effect on its liquidity. In September 2023, the Company completed an underwritten equity offering and sold shares of its common stock at a price of per share to the public. Before estimated offering expenses of million, the Company received proceeds of approximately million net of the underwriting discount. On September 10, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with a third party for an asset acquisition where the acquired asset was in-process research and development primarily in exchange for an equity consideration payment. In addition, pursuant to the agreement, certain employees of the third party became employees of the Company. The third party was a biotechnology company focused on oncology. The total upfront acquisition consideration amounted to million, composed of the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock with a fair value of million, approximately million of cash consideration, assumed net liabilities of million, as well as million of acquisition related legal and accounting costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The Company accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the estimated fair value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in a single identified in-process research and development asset IPR D ), thus satisfying the requirements of the screen test in Accounting Standards Update ASU 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of Business . The estimated fair value of the acquired workforce was not significant. The Company concluded the acquired IPR D has no alternative-future use and accordingly expensed approximately million, on the day the transaction closed as research and development expense, which was reflected in its consolidated statement of operations.

 million was estimated to be paid via issuance of an estimated additional shares of the Company s common stock, consistent with the registration statement filed with the SEC on September 10, 2021, upon achievement of defined milestones relating to product development, commercial launch and continued employment of certain selling shareholders, each of which was revalued at each reporting date and amount of compensation expense was adjusted accordingly and reported in research and development expenses. In November 2022, the terms of the payment for any remaining consideration were modified, resulting in million of consideration paid in December 2022 and million of consideration paid in March 2023, with such consideration primarily consisting of the Company s common stock. Based on the Company s current business plan, the Company believes that its existing cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for at least 12 months after November 12, 2024.

Further, due to the short-term nature of these investments, the Company has the ability and intention to hold any such investments until maturity and does not expect to realize any material investment losses. As such, the Company has assessed the unrealized loss position for available-for-sale securities and determined that an allowance for credit loss was not necessary.

 million. In August 2024, the Company participated in a subsequent round of series B financing and purchased an additional million of series B preferred shares at the same valuation as the initial round of financing in December 2021. The Company does not hold a seat on MyOme s board of directors. The Company s investment in MyOme is recorded at cost and impairment was identified as of September 30, 2024. The following are the Company s related persons and the basis of each such related person s relationship with MyOme: Matthew Rabinowitz, the Company s executive chairman and co-founder, is the chairman of the board and founder of MyOme, and a beneficial holder of approximately of the outstanding shares of MyOme on a fully dilutive basis; Jonathan Sheena, the Company s co-founder and a member of the Company s board of directors, is a stockholder and a member of the board of directors of MyOme; Daniel Rabinowitz, the Company s Secretary and Chief Legal Officer, is a stockholder of MyOme; and Roelof Botha, the Lead Independent Director of the Company s board of directors, is a managing member of Sequoia Capital. Certain funds affiliated with Sequoia Capital also participated in MyOme s series B financing. 
 None of the related party investments in MyOme by our executives and directors noted above were at the behest of the Company nor funded by the Company. In February 2024, the Company entered into a collaboration and commercialization agreement (the Collaboration Agreement with MyOme pursuant to which the parties will partner to offer certain genetic testing services to be developed and funded solely by MyOme and overseen by a joint steering committee. The Company will assist MyOme with commercial activities. In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, the Company received a warrant to purchase shares of MyOme's common stock at an exercise price of per share, which will vest upon a MyOme liquidity event (as such terms are defined in MyOme's certificate of incorporation). Additionally, upon the achievement of certain product commercialization milestones, the Company is eligible to receive an additional warrant exercisable for shares of Myome s series B preferred stock with an exercise price of per share. During September 2024, the Company achieved certain product commercialization milestones such that the warrant for shares of MyOme s series B preferred stock was due from MyOme to the Company. As these warrants have not yet been granted and issued by MyOme, the Company recorded these warrants as a receivable on its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of issuance or the date they became receivable from MyOme and are accounted for using the measurement alternative. impairment was identified as of September 30, 2024. The warrants and warrant receivable have been included within other assets and allocated between short-term and long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, which will be recognized as a reduction of selling and marketing expense upon commercialization and sale of the products contemplated under the Collaboration Agreement. Subject to the Company's achievement of certain commercialization milestones, the Company may receive additional warrants to purchase MyOme s Series B Preferred Stock. To the extent the genetic testing services are successfully commercialized, the Company will owe certain royalty payments to MyOme. Should the Company exercise all its MyOme common and series B preferred stock warrants, with the series B preferred stock held, the Company would own an accumulated of MyOme on a fully diluted basis. This excludes the shares of MyOme s series B preferred stock warrant receivable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s carrying amount of ownership interest in MyOme was million and million, respectively, on its condensed consolidated balance sheet. The carrying value of the warrants and warrant receivable as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and , respectively, on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

 of cash collections attributable to such product revenue occurs within with the remaining collections generally taking an additional . During this time, management routinely reassesses its estimates of actual to expected cash collections, which are based on historical collection rates and adjusted for current information and trends. To the extent cash collections for tests delivered in prior periods are trending higher than expectations, the Company will increase revenue recognized when sufficient evidence is obtained to conclude the additional revenue will not result in a reversal of revenue in a future period. Given the historical uncertainties with respect to the timing and extent of cash collections for test services provided, sufficient evidence is obtained once cash collected exceeds the amount of revenue recognized during a given period. If cash collections for tests delivered in prior periods are trending below expectations, the Company will reduce revenue to the amount expected to be collected based on the latest information and expectations. Increases or decreases to the amount of cash expected to be collected for tests delivered in prior periods are recognized in product revenue with a corresponding impact to accounts receivable during the period such determination is made. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company increased revenue by a net of million and million, respectively, for collections related to tests delivered in prior periods that were fully collected (including an estimate of unapplied receipts). The increased revenue and decreased net loss resulted in a corresponding decrease in loss per share by and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company increased revenue for collected cash in excess of initial revenue recognized by a net of million for collections related to tests delivered in prior periods that were fully collected (including an estimate of unapplied receipts). The increased revenue and decreased net loss resulted in a corresponding decrease in loss per share by for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reduced revenue by a net of million for a reduction in expected collections related to tests delivered in prior periods. The decreased revenue and increased net loss resulted in a corresponding increase in loss per share by for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million in cash receipts which had not yet been applied to specific accounts receivables. The Company reviewed the historical unapplied payment trends, and, within the unapplied cash receipts of million, the Company estimated approximately million was related to tests delivered in prior periods that were fully collected. Additionally, as overpayments were not material in prior years, the Company accounted for temporary unapplied balances as of September 30, 2024, as contra accounts receivable on the Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the unapplied accounts receivable balance was million. Product revenue is constrained for refunds estimated to be paid to insurance carriers. Certain refunds are recognized in accrued liabilities until they are either paid to the respective insurance carrier or it is determined the refund will not ultimately be paid, at which time the related accrual is reduced with a corresponding increase to revenue. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the reserves for refunds to insurance carriers were reduced and product revenue increased by million and million, respectively, for amounts the Company determined would not be refunded to insurance carriers.

The Company recognizes licensing and other revenues through agreements with pharmaceutical companies in support of potential clinical trials managed by the pharmaceutical companies. Constellation The laboratory partners with whom the Company enters into a licensing arrangement represent the licensees and are identified as customers. The licensees do not have the right to possess the Company s software, but rather receive services through the cloud software. These arrangements often include: (i) the delivery of the services through the cloud software, (ii) the necessary support and training, and (iii) the IVD kits to be consumed as tests are processed. The Company does not consider the software as a service, the support or the training as being distinct in the context of such arrangements, and therefore, these items are combined as a single performance obligation. The software, support and training are delivered simultaneously to the licensees over the term of the arrangement. The Company bills the majority of licensees, who process the tests in their laboratories, a fixed price for each test processed. Licensing revenues are recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied (i.e., upon the delivery of each test) and reported in licensing and other revenues in the Company s statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

 per share, at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock, convertible to shares of common stock. The conversion rate and corresponding conversion price are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, but will not be adjusted for any accrued or unpaid interest. The holders of the Convertible Notes who redeem their Convertible Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, the holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Convertible Notes at a price equal to of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to May 2024, and no sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes, at the Company s option, on or after May 2024, if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock has been at least of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days during any consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The first and third circumstances noted above have been met as of September 30, 2024. On July 19, 2024, the Company elected to exercise its optional redemption right to redeem all million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Convertible Notes due 2027 and instructed Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee under the Convertible Notes Indenture (the Indenture Agreement governing the Convertible Notes, to issue a redemption notice to registered holders of the Convertible Notes. The date fixed for the redemption of the Convertible Notes is October 11, 2024 (the Redemption Date ). The redemption price for the Convertible Notes is equal to of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. The Company elected physical settlement with the Company s shares of common stock as the settlement method to apply to all conversions of the Convertible Notes. All terms and conditions associated with physical settlement are noted within the terms of the original Indenture Agreement. The conversion rate for holders who convert their Convertible Notes in connection with the Company s election to redeem the Convertible Notes was increased by additional shares pursuant to the Indenture Agreement. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivative and Heading-Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in Entity s Own Equity , the Company allocated all of the debt discount to long-term debt. The debt discount is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method, computed to be , over the life of the Convertible Notes or approximately its term.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded total income tax expense (benefit) of approximately and , respectively. The income tax expense is primarily attributable to state income tax and foreign income tax. Due to the Company s history of cumulative operating losses, the Company concluded that, after considering all the available objective evidence, it is not more likely than not that all of the Company s net deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, all of the Company s deferred tax assets, which includes net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits related primarily to research and development, continue to be subjected to a full valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024. The Company will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until there is sufficient evidence to support recoverability of its deferred tax assets. Interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters are recognized as a component of income tax expense. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. million based on the closing price of the Company s common stock as of September 30, 2024. Since the Company is in a net loss position in the periods presented, the shares which would be issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are excluded from the net loss per share calculation, as it would have an antidilutive effect. As such, the million shares underlying the conversion option of the Convertible Notes have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. On July 19, 2024, the Company elected to exercise its optional redemption right to redeem all million aggregate principal amount of its Convertible Notes. On the Redemption Date, million of Convertible Notes was converted in exchange for million shares of the Company s common stock.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2024. Overview We are a diagnostics company with proprietary molecular and bioinformatics technology that we are applying to change the management of disease worldwide. Our cell-free DNA, or cfDNA, technology combines our novel molecular assays, which reliably measure many informative regions across the genome from samples as small as a single cell, with our statistical algorithms, which incorporate data available from the broader scientific community to identify genetic variations covering a wide range of serious conditions with high accuracy and coverage. We aim to make personalized genetic testing and diagnostics part of the standard of care to protect health and inform earlier and more targeted interventions that help lead to longer, healthier lives. We currently provide a comprehensive suite of products in women s health, as well as our oncology and organ health products, and our Constellation cloud-based platform. We generate a majority of our revenues from the sale of Panorama, our non-invasive prenatal test, or NIPT, as well as Horizon, our Carrier Screening, test. In addition to Panorama and Horizon, our product offerings in women s health include Spectrum Preimplantation Genetics, our Anora miscarriage test, and Vistara single-gene NIPT, as well as our Empower hereditary cancer screening test, which we also plan to offer to oncologists through our oncology sales channel. We also offer our Signatera molecular residual disease test for oncology applications, which we commercialized as a test run in our CLIA (as defined below) laboratory and offer on a research use only basis to research laboratories and pharmaceutical companies; and our Prospera organ transplant assessment tests. We process tests in our laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (or CLIA) in Austin, Texas and San Carlos, California. A portion of our testing is performed by third-party laboratories. Our customers include independent laboratories, national and regional reference laboratories, medical centers and physician practices for our screening tests, research laboratories and pharmaceutical companies. We market and sell our tests through our direct sales force and, for our women s health tests, through our laboratory distribution partners. We bill clinics, laboratory distribution partners, patients, pharmaceutical companies and insurance payers for the tests we perform. In cases where we bill laboratory distribution partners, our partners in turn bill clinics, patients and insurers. The majority of our revenue comes from insurers with whom we have in-network contracts. Such insurers reimburse us for our tests pursuant to our in-network contracts with them, based on positive coverage determinations, which means that the insurer has determined that the test in general is medically necessary for this category of patient. In addition to offering tests to be performed at our laboratories, either directly or through our laboratory distribution partners, we also establish licensing arrangements with laboratories under Constellation, our cloud-based distribution model, whereby our laboratory licensees run the molecular workflows themselves and then access our bioinformatics algorithms through our cloud-based software. This cloud-based distribution model results in lower revenues and gross profit per test than cases in which we process a test ourselves; however, because we do not incur the costs of processing the tests, our costs per test under this model are also lower. We began entering into these licensing arrangements starting in the fourth quarter of 2015. The principal focus of our commercial operations is to offer our tests through both our direct sales force and laboratory distribution partners, and our Constellation licensees under our cloud-based distribution model. The number of tests that we accession is a key indicator that we use to assess our business. A test is accessioned when we receive the test at our laboratory, the relevant information about the test is entered into our computer system, and the test sample is routed into the appropriate workflow. This number is a subset of the number of tests that we process, which includes tests distributed through our Constellation licensees. The number of tests that we process is a key metric as it tracks overall

 volume growth, particularly as our laboratory partners may transition from sending samples to our laboratory to our cloud-based distribution model, as a result of which our tests accessioned would decrease but our tests processed would remain unchanged. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we processed approximately 2,271,800 tests, comprised of approximately 2,223,500 tests accessioned in our laboratory, compared to approximately 1,869,400 tests processed, comprised of approximately 1,816,500 tests accessioned in our laboratory, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in volume primarily represents continued commercial growth of Signatera, Panorama and Horizon, both as tests performed in our laboratory as well as through our Constellation software platform. The percent of our revenues attributable to our U.S. direct sales force for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 94 , an increase compared to 91 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The percent of our revenues attributable to U.S. laboratory distribution partners for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3 , a decrease compared to 6 from the same period in the prior year. Our ability to increase our revenues and gross profit will depend on our ability to further penetrate the U.S. market with our direct sales force. The percent of our revenues attributable to international laboratory distribution partners and other international sales for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues were 1,220.9 million compared to 771.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Product revenues accounted for 1,212.2 million, 99 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 761.3 million representing 99 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no customers exceeded 10 of the total revenues on an individual basis. Revenues from customers outside the United States were 30.3 million, representing approximately 3 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenues from customers outside the United States were 25.0 million, representing approximately 3 total revenues. Most of our revenues have been denominated in U.S. dollars, though we generate some revenue in foreign currency, primarily denominated in Euros and Singapore Dollars. Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 136.7 million and 356.8 million, respectively. This included non-cash stock compensation expense of 202.5 million and 142.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 2.5 billion. Components of the Results of Operations Revenues Product Revenues We generate revenues from the sale of our tests, primarily from the sale of our Panorama and Horizon tests. Our two primary distribution channels are our direct sales force and our laboratory partners. In cases where we promote our tests through our direct sales force, we generally bill directly to a patient, clinic or insurance carrier, or a combination of the insurance carrier and patient, for the fees. Sales of our clinical tests are recorded as product revenues. Revenues recognized from tests processed through our Constellation model, and from our strategic partnership agreements are reported in licensing and other revenues. In cases where we sell our tests through our laboratory partners, the majority of our laboratory partners bill the patient, clinic or insurance carrier for the performance of our tests, and we are entitled to either a fixed price per test or a percentage of their collections.

Table of Contents 
 Our ability to increase our revenues will depend on our ability to further penetrate the domestic and international markets and, in particular, generate sales through our direct sales force, develop and commercialize additional tests, obtain reimbursement from additional third-party payers and increase our reimbursement rates for tests performed. For example, our financial performance depends on reimbursement for microdeletions testing. Many third-party payers do not currently reimburse for microdeletions screening in part because there has historically been limited published data on the performance of microdeletions screening tests, with our single nucleotide polymorphism-based Microdeletion and Aneuploidy RegisTry, or SMART study results only being published in early 2022. Entering into in-network contracts continues to be an important part of our business strategy, as we believe that in-network coverage of our tests by third-party payers is crucial to our growth and long-term success, as in-network pricing is more predictable than out-of-network pricing, enables us to develop stable, long-term relationships with third-party payers, and provides access to a larger population of covered lives. However, the negotiated fees under our contracts with third party payers are typically lower than the list price of our tests, and in some cases the third party payers that we contract with have negative coverage determinations for some of our offerings, in particular Panorama for microdeletions screening. Therefore, being in network with third party payers has in the past had, and may in the future have, an adverse impact on our revenues and gross margins. We intend to mitigate any impact by driving more business from our most profitable accounts. Licensing and Other Revenues Revenues recognized from tests processed through our Constellation model and from our strategic partnership agreements are reported in licensing and other revenues. We also recognize licensing revenues through the licensing and the provisioning of services to support the use of our proprietary technology by licensees under our cloud-based distribution model. Our strategy to offer access to our algorithm to laboratory licensees via our Constellation cloud-based software platform may also cause our revenues to decrease because we do not process the tests and perform the molecular biology analysis in our own laboratory under this model, and therefore are not able to charge as high an amount and, as a result, realize lower revenues per test than when we perform the entire test ourselves. Cost of Product Revenues The components of our cost of product revenues are material and service costs, impairment charges associated with testing equipment, personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with testing samples, electronic medical records, order and delivery systems, shipping charges to transport samples, costs incurred from third party test processing fees, and allocated overhead such as rent, information technology costs, equipment depreciation and utilities. Costs associated with Whole Exome Sequencing, are also included, as well as labor costs, relating to our Signatera CLIA and Signatera research use only offerings. Costs associated with performing tests are recorded when the test is accessioned. We expect cost of product revenues in absolute dollars to increase as the number of tests we perform increases. As we continue to achieve scale, we have increased our focus on more efficient use of labor, automation, and DNA sequencing. For example, we updated the molecular and bioinformatics process for Panorama to further reduce the sequencing reagents, test steps and associated labor costs required to obtain a test result, while increasing the accuracy of the test to allow it to run with lower fetal fraction input. These improvements also reduced the frequency of the need to require blood redraws from the patient. Cost of Licensing and Other Revenues The components of our cost of licensing and other revenues are material costs associated with test kits sold to Constellation clients, development and support services relating to our strategic partnership agreements and other costs.

Table of Contents 
 We consider our cost of licensing and other revenues for the Constellation software platform to be relatively low, and therefore we expect its associated gross margin to be higher. We expect our cost of licensing will increase in relation to volume growth. Expenses Research and Development Research and development expenses include costs incurred to develop our technology, collect clinical samples and conduct clinical studies to develop and support our products. These costs consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense; prototype materials; laboratory supplies; consulting costs; regulatory costs; electronic medical record set up costs; and costs associated with setting up and conducting clinical studies at domestic and international sites and allocated overhead, including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing enhanced and new products. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses include executive, selling and marketing, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, billing and client services. These expenses consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense; direct marketing expenses; audit and legal expenses; consulting costs; training and medical education activities; payer outreach programs and allocated overhead, including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation, and utilities. Interest Expense Interest expense is attributable to borrowing under our Convertible Senior Notes (the Convertible Notes and credit line with UBS (the Credit Line ), including the amortization of debt discounts. Interest Income and Other (Expense) Income, Net Interest income and other (expense) income, net is comprised of interest earned on our cash, realized gains and losses on investments and assets, sublease rental income, and foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses. Critical Accounting Policies Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated, and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be revenue recognition and stock-based compensation attributable to performance-based awards. There have been no material changes to our other critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 171.5 million, or 63.9 , when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. We derive our revenues from tests based on units reported to customers tests delivered with a result. All reported units are either accessioned in our laboratory or processed outside of our laboratory. As noted in the section titled Overview above, the number of tests that we process is a key metric as it tracks our overall volume growth. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, total reported units were approximately 750,100, comprised of approximately 735,900 tests reported in our laboratory. Comparatively, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, total reported units were approximately 590,000, comprised of approximately 575,000 tests reported in our laboratory. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total oncology units processed were approximately 137,100 and 88,800, respectively. Product Revenues During the three months ended September 30, 2024, product revenues increased by 170.9 million, or 64.4 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the continued revenue growth from increased test volumes, average selling price improvements, as well as cash receipts of 34.5 million collected during the current period related to tests delivered in prior periods that were fully collected.

 Licensing and Other Revenues Licensing and other revenues increased by 0.5 million, or 17.6 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a increase in revenue from our collaborative agreements. Cost of Product Revenues During the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of product revenues increased compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 by approximately 20.7 million, or 14.1 , primarily due to a 7.4 million increase in third-party fees, higher costs related to inventory consumption of 9.2 million driven by an increase in accessioned cases, and a 4.1 million increase in equipment and related depreciation expense, labor, overhead, shipping and other related costs driven by headcount growth and product support. Cost of Licensing and Other Revenues Cost of licensing and other revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was flat, primarily due to minimal change in costs to support our collaborative agreements. Expenses Research and Development Research and development expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 19.7 million, or 25.5 , when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to a 11.6 million increase in salary and related compensation expenditures (including a 4.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense), a 5.8 million increase in consulting expenses, and a 4.5 million increase in lab and clinical trial related expenses, which was offset by a 2.2 million net decrease in travel, office, facilities, and other expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 59.4 million, or 38.4 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to a 29.7 million increase in salary and related compensation expenditures (including an 8.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense), a 15.4 million increase in consulting and legal expenses, a 5.6 million increase in vendor expenses, and a 8.7 million net increase in marketing, travel, facilities, office and other costs. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased by 0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of the slight decrease in interest rate. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.2 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to greater cash and investment balances driving higher interest income.

Total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 449.4 million, or 58.3 , when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We derive our revenues from tests based on units reported to customers tests delivered with a result. All reported units are either accessioned in our laboratory or processed outside of our laboratory. As noted in the section titled Overview above, the number of tests that we process is a key metric, as it tracks overall volume growth. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total reported units were approximately 2,154,700, comprised of approximately 2,109,200 tests reported in our laboratory. Comparatively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, total reported units were approximately 1,768,400, comprised of approximately 1,719,200 tests reported in our laboratory. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total oncology units processed were approximately 377,400 and 243,500, respectively. Product Revenues During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, product revenues increased by 450.9 million, or 59.2 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the continued revenue growth from increased test volumes, average selling price improvements, as well as cash receipts of 108.1 million collected during the current period related to tests delivered in prior periods that were fully collected. Licensing and Other Revenues Licensing and other revenues decreased by 1.5 million, or 14.8 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our collaborative agreements.

 Cost of Product Revenues During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of product revenues increased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 by approximately 58.8 million, or 13.4 , due to a 22.2 million increase in third-party fees, higher costs related to inventory consumption of 20.5 million driven by an increase in accessioned cases, and a 16.1 million increase in shipping, equipment and related depreciation expense, labor, overhead, and other related costs driven by headcount growth and product support. Cost of Licensing and Other Revenues Cost of licensing and other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, decreased by 0.1 million, or 6.6 , primarily due to a net decrease in costs to support our collaborative agreements. Expenses Research and Development Research and development expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 37.0 million, or 15.5 , when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to an increase of 31.1 million in salary and related compensation expenditures (including a 17.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense), and a 3.9 million increase in consulting expenses, and a 2.0 million net increase in office, facilities, lab and clinical trial related expenses, and other expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 149.5 million, or 32.7 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to an increase of 82.2 million increase in salary and related compensation expenditures (including a 40.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense), a 35.7 million increase in consulting and legal expenses, a 4.0 million increase in marketing expenses, a 5.6 million increase in travel expenses, a 4.7 million increase in office costs, a 14.5 million increase in vendor expenses, and a 2.8 million increase in facilities and other costs. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased 0.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of the slight decrease in interest rate. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 17.8 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to greater cash and investment balances driving higher interest income. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have incurred net losses each year since our inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 136.7 million, and we expect to continue to incur losses in future periods as we continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to our research and development and commercialization efforts for our existing and new products. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 2.5 billion. As of September 30, 2024, we had 892.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, 29.5 million in marketable securities, 80.4 million of outstanding balance under the Credit Line including accrued interest, and 287.5 million outstanding principal balance on the Convertible Notes. As of September 30, 2024, we had 20.0 million remaining and available on the Credit Line.

 While we have introduced multiple products that are generating revenues, these revenues have not been sufficient to fund all operations. Accordingly, we have funded the portion of operating costs that exceeds revenues through a combination of equity issuances and debt and other financings. We expect to develop and commercialize future products and continue to invest in the growth of our business and, consequently, we will need to generate additional revenues to achieve future profitability and may need to raise additional equity or incur additional debt. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders would experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders and requires significant debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. Additional financing may not be available at all, or in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to delay the development and commercialization of our products and significantly scale back our business and operations. In September 2023, we completed an underwritten equity offering and sold 4,550,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 55 per share to the public. Before offering expenses of approximately 0.4 million, we received proceeds of approximately 235.8 million net of the underwriting discount. Our contractual obligations and other commitments have been satisfied by the equity offering described above, our convertible note financing conducted in April 2020 described below, the Credit Line described below, and our product, licensing, and other sales. For our commitments, refer to the Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments section below. Refer to additional disclosures associated with risks and our ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet capital requirements for both short-term and long-term obligations. Based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least 12 months after November 12, 2024. Credit Line Agreement In September 2015, we entered into a Credit Line with UBS, or the Credit Line, providing for a 50.0 million revolving line of credit which could be drawn in increments at any time. The Credit Line was amended in July 2017 and bears interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 1.10 , and it is secured by a first priority lien and security interest in our money market and marketable securities held in our managed investment account with UBS. UBS has the right to demand full or partial payment of the Credit Line obligations and terminate it, in its discretion and without cause, at any time. The interest rate was subsequently changed to the 30-day Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR average, plus 1.21 . The SOFR rate is variable. The Credit Line was subsequently increased from 50.0 million to 150.0 million. In June 2023, the Credit Line decreased to 100.0 million. In October 2023, the interest rate for the Credit Line was subsequently changed to the 30-day SOFR average, plus 0.5 . As of September 30, 2024, the total principal amount outstanding with accrued interest was 80.4 million and 20.0 million is remaining as available under the Credit Line.

 Convertible Notes In April 2020, we issued 287.5 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes in a private placement offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We received net proceeds from the Convertible Notes of 278.3 million, after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and debt issuance costs. We used approximately 79.2 million of the net proceeds from the Convertible Notes offering to repay our obligations under our credit agreement with OrbiMed Royalty Opportunities II, LP. The Convertible Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 2.25 per year, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears in May and November of each year, beginning in November 2020. The Convertible Notes mature in May 2027, unless earlier converted, repurchased or redeemed in accordance with their terms. Upon conversion, the Convertible Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. On July 19, 2024, we elected to exercise our optional redemption right to redeem all 287.5 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2.25 Convertible Notes due 2027 and instructed Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee under the Indenture Agreement governing the Convertible Notes, to issue a redemption notice to registered holders of the Convertible Notes. The Redemption Date fixed for the redemption of the Convertible Notes was October 11, 2024. The redemption price for the Convertible Notes is equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. We elected physical settlement with shares of our common stock as the settlement method to apply to all conversions of the Convertible Notes. On the Redemption Date, 287.4 million of Convertible Notes were converted for approximately 7.5 million shares of our common stock under the terms of the redemption notice. The remaining Convertible Notes not converted under the redemption notice were redeemed in exchange for cash at face value plus any accrued interest totaling 0.1 million. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our condensed consolidated cash flows for the periods indicated:

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments We have entered into arrangements that contractually obligate us to make payments that will affect our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Such arrangements include those related to our lease commitments, Credit Line, Convertible Notes, commercial supply agreements and other agreements. Credit Line The short-term debt obligations consist of the 80.4 million principal amount drawn from the Credit Line with UBS and applicable interest. The Credit Line was amended in July 2017 and bears interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 1.10 , and it is secured by a first priority lien and security interest in our money market and marketable securities held in our managed investment account with UBS. The interest rate was subsequently changed to the 30-day SOFR average, plus 1.21 . The SOFR rate is variable. UBS has the right to demand full or partial payment of the Credit Line obligations and terminate it, in its discretion and without cause, at any time. In October 2023, the interest rate was subsequently changed to the 30-day SOFR average, plus 0.5 . Please refer to Note 10, Debt , for further details. Convertible Notes The long-term debt obligations consist of the 287.5 million principal amount from a private placement offering to qualified institutional buyers and applicable interest.

 each year, beginning in November 2020. The Convertible Notes mature in May 2027, unless earlier converted, repurchased or redeemed in accordance with their terms. Upon conversion, the Convertible Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. On July 19, 2024, we elected to exercise our optional redemption right to redeem all 287.5 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Convertible Notes and instructed Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee under the Convertible Notes Indenture (the Indenture Agreement governing the Convertible Notes, to issue a redemption notice to registered holders of the Convertible Notes. The date fixed for the redemption of the Convertible Notes was October 11, 2024 (the Redemption Date ). On the Redemption Date, 287.4 million of Convertible Notes were converted for approximately 7.5 million shares of our common stock under the terms of the redemption notice. The remaining Convertible Notes not converted under the redemption notice were redeemed in exchange for cash at face value plus any accrued interest totaling 0.1 million. As such, we reclassified 0.1 million of Convertible Notes from long-term liabilities to short-term liabilities as of September 30, 2024. Inventory purchase and other contractual obligations We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with various third parties for clinical trials, preclinical research studies, testing, manufacturing, and other services for operational purposes. Payments due upon cancellation generally consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancellable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments have not been included separately within these contractual and other obligations disclosures. Please refer to Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Operating leases Our lease commitments consist of 0.7 million of payments, which will be paid over the terms of the leases. The leases have not commenced under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842), as of September 30, 2024. As a result, these leases are not reflected within the consolidated balance sheets. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily relate to interest rates. Our Credit Line had an interest rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 1.10 . The interest rate was subsequently changed to the 30-day SOFR average, plus 1.21 . The SOFR rate is variable. In October 2023, the interest rate for the Credit Line was subsequently changed to the 30-day SOFR average, plus 0.5 . An incremental change in the borrowing rate of 100 basis points would increase our annual interest expense by 0.8 million based on our 80.4 million gross debt outstanding on our Credit Line, including principal and accrued interest as of September 30, 2024. The interest rate for our Convertible Notes is fixed at 2.25 and not exposed market risk related to interest rates. Our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. This risk is mitigated as we have maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio. An incremental change in the investment yield of 100 basis points would increase our annual interest income by approximately 0.3 million annually in relation to amounts we would expect to earn, based on our short-term investments as of September 30, 2024. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations Our operations are currently conducted primarily in the United States. As we expand internationally, our results of operations and cash flows may become subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In 

 49 

Table of Contents 
 periods when the U.S. dollar declines in value as compared to the foreign currencies in which we incur expenses, our foreign currency-based expenses will increase when translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, future fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar may affect the price at which we sell our tests outside the United States. To date, our foreign currency risk has been minimal, and we have not historically hedged our foreign currency risk; however, we may consider doing so in the future. Inflation Risk As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through increases in revenue as increases in core inflation rates may also negatively affect demand for our product offerings. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
