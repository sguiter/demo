ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain statements, other than purely historical
information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results,
and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, 
 anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, 
 will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar
expressions. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained
in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are including this statement for purposes of complying with those safe-harbor
provisions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties
which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual
effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and
future prospects on a consolidated basis include but are not limited to changes in economic conditions, incorporating acquisitions, changes
in the supply chain for raw materials, effects of Covid and wars, including the Ukraine war, legislative/regulatory changes, availability
of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered
in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. We undertake no obligation to update
or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Further information
concerning our business, including additional factors that could materially affect our financial results, is included herein and in our
other filings with the SEC. 

General 

The following is a discussion by management of
its view of the Company s business, financial condition, and corporate performance for the past year. The purpose of this information
is to give management s recap of the past year, and to give an understanding of management s current outlook for the near
future. This section is meant to be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements of the period Report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview 

SAML is a Nevada Corporation that is majority-owned
by ILUS. SAML functions as the Emergency Response subsidiary of ILUS and provides strategic management oversight to its operating
businesses, which includes but is not limited to, financial and administrative management, sales, marketing, and human resources support. 

Factors Affecting Our Performance 

The primary factors affecting our results of operations include but
not limited to: 

General Macro Economic Conditions 

Our business is impacted by the global economic
environment, employment levels, consumer confidence, government, and municipal spending. Global instability in securities markets and
the Russian invasion of Ukraine are among other factors that can impact our financial performance. In particular, changes in the U.S.
economic climate can impact the demand of our product range. The Industrial and Manufacturing sectors are impacted by the overall economic
environment as addressed in the risk factors. Tenders can be withdrawn and lead times for the manufacturing can be affected which can
result in cancellation of orders if not delivered on time. 

New Business Direction Emergency Response Technologies 

On January 3, 2024, Ilustrato Pictures International
Inc. ILUS acquired a convertible note from YAII PN, LTD with outstanding principal and accrued interest of 600,685 in
the Company. On January 5, 2024, the Company reissued a convertible note to ILUS who on the same day converted the note into 150,753,425
shares of common stock in the Company. As a result of such conversion, Ilustrato acquired control of 91.5 of the outstanding shares
in SAML as of January 5, 2024. 

As a result of these transactions, the Company
is now focused on the public safety and emergency response sector. Historically, the company has evolved out of the emergency response
sector mainly through developing and manufacturing Emergency Services products, including Emergency Response vehicles, Special Vehicle
conversions, Commercial EVs, and IoT Technology. The Company also intends to acquire complementary companies with disruptive technology,
strong management, and potential for rapid growth that may benefit from our other group companies' cross-pollination of territories, products,
and skills. 

18 

As a result of these transactions the results
of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , are comparing the results of the legacy luggage
business with Emergency Response Technologies for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Planned Developments 

In the final quarter of 2024, the Company will
allocate resources to its operating subsidiaries in a continued effort to increase efficiency, drive increased sales, and positively impact
its financial results. 

Results of Operations for the Nine Three months ended September
30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 

Revenue 

The Company generated revenues through the sale
and distribution of smart luggage products and following the aforementioned change in business direction, through the sale of public safety
and emergency response products and services. Revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 26,94k compared to 358k
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the total revenue is due to the acquisitions. 

The Company generated revenues through the sale
and distribution of smart luggage products and following the aforementioned change in business direction, through the sale of public safety
and emergency response products and services. Revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 666k compared to 9k
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the total revenue is due to the acquisitions. 

Costs of Sales 

Costs of sales consist of the purchase of raw
materials, the cost of production and labor. Cost of revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 1,803k compared
to 203K for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the costs due to the acquisitions. 

Costs of sales consist of the purchase of raw
materials, the cost of production and labor. Cost of revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 404k compared
to 17K for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the costs due to the acquisitions. 

Gross Profit 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
Gross Profit totaled 891K, representing a Gross Profit margin of 33 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Gross Profit totaled
 155K. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
Gross Profit totaled 262K, representing a Gross Profit margin of 39 . During the three months ended September 30, 2023, Gross loss totaled
 8K. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses totaled 3,033K during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 541K during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses
is due to acquisitions. 

Operating expenses totaled 1,145K during the
three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 81K during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses
is due to acquisitions. 

Net Profit/Loss 

Company realized a net loss of 2,153K for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of 876K for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Company realized a net loss of 900K for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of 687K for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

19 

The increased Net Loss is due to the change in
business direction, decreased sales in certain operating businesses and increased operating expenses in 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate
funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors
in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditure. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 102K
of cash, total current assets of 3,785K and total current liabilities of 5,303K creating a working capital deficit of 1,518K. As of
December 31, 2023, the Company had 12K of cash, total current assets of 12K, and total current liabilities of 2,064K, creating a working
capital deficit of 2,052K. 

The working capital deficit was mainly attributable
to a change in business acquisitions and legacy receivables from subsidiaries transferred from ILUS to SAML with the acquisition of the
subsidiaries collectively called Emergency Response Technologies as well as the conversion of notes. 

Net cash generated from operating activities
was (635)K for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash used in operating activities of (117)K for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The Company generates cash through revenue and uses cash for general and administrative expenses and other
working capital purposes. 

Net cash used in investing activities was 9,784K
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash used in investing activities of 0 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The Company s primary uses of cash have been for acquisition of the subsidiary collectively known as Emergency Response
Technologies. 

Net cash in from finance activities was 10,509K
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash finance activities of (16)K, for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The Company primarily generated cash from issuance of shares and loans. 

We have principally financed our operations through
the sale of our common stock and the issuance of debt. Due to our operational losses, we relied to a large extent on financing our cash
flow requirements through the issuance of common stock and debt. There can be no assurance we will be successful in raising the necessary
funds to execute our business plan. 

Necessity of Additional Financing 

Securing additional financing is critical to
the implementation of our business plan. If and when we obtain the required additional financing, we should be able to fully implement
our business plan. In the event we are unable to raise any additional funds we will not be able to pursue our business plan, and we may
fail entirely. We currently have limited committed sources of financing. 

Going Concern Consideration 

The above conditions raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the accompanying
financial statements regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional
note disclosures describing the circumstances that led to this disclosure by our independent auditors. Although we anticipate that our
current operations will provide us with cash resources, we believe existing cash will not be sufficient to fund planned operations and
projects through the next 12 months. Therefore, we believe we will need to increase our sales, attain profitability, and raise additional
funds to finance our future operations. Any meaningful equity or debt financing will likely result in significant dilution to our existing
stockholders. There is no assurance that additional funds will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

To address these risks, we must, among other
things, implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy surrounding our products, continually develop and upgrade
our operating business websites, respond to competitive developments, lower our financing costs, and attract, retain and motivate qualified
personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so can have a material
adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 

20 

Seasonality 

We do not expect our sales to be impacted by seasonal demands for
our products. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Item 3. - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information necessary under this item. 

Item 4. - Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are
also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based on the controls evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in
our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Commission, and that
material information relating to our company and our consolidated subsidiary is made known to management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, particularly during the period when our periodic reports are being prepared. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial
reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to
error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September
30, 2024, that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

21 

Part II: Other Information 

Item 1 - Legal Proceedings 

We know of no material, existing or pending legal
proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings
in which any of our directors, officers, or any affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a
material interest adverse to our interests. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously
disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
