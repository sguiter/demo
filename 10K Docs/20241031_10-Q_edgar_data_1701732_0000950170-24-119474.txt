Overview 
 We are a global leader in computational intelligence and we provide software and cloud solutions in simulation, high-performance computing (HPC), data analytics, and AI. We enable organizations across all industries to compete more effectively and drive smarter decisions in an increasingly connected world - all while creating a greener, more sustainable future. 
 Acquisitions 
 In April 2024, we acquired Cambridge Semantics, a modern data fabric provider and creator of the industry s leading analytical graph database. Cambridge Semantics technologies will be integrated into the Altair RapidMiner platform. 
 In April 2024, we acquired Research in Flight, maker of FlightStream, which provides computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software with a large footprint in the aerospace and defense sector and a growing presence in marine, energy, turbomachinery, and automotive applications. The technology will be integrated into the Altair HyperWorks design and simulation platform. 
 In July 2024, we acquired Metrics Design Automation Inc. Metrics ), a Canadian company with a simulation as a service (SaaS) business model for semiconductor electronic functional simulation and design verification. The Metrics digital simulator, Dsim, will be available through Altair One, Altair s cloud innovation gateway, where it will also be available for desktop download. 
 In August 2024, we acquired KSK Analytics, a Japanese firm that offers strategic consulting and training in AI and data analytics. KSK has been a reseller of the Altair RapidMiner platform for data analytics and AI. 
 Settlement of 2024 Notes 
 In June 2024, we settled the remaining balance of our convertible senior notes which matured on June 1, 2024 (the 2024 Notes by paying cash for the principal amount of 81.7 million and issuing 796,817 shares of our Class A common stock, with a fair value of 70.8 million. 
 Factors Affecting our Performance 
 We believe that our future success will depend on many factors, including those described below. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to achieve successful results. If we are unable to address these challenges, our business, operating results and prospects could be harmed. Please see Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Seasonality and quarterly results 
 Our billings have historically been highest in the first and fourth quarters of any calendar year and may vary in future quarters. The timing of recording billings and the corresponding effect on our cash flows may vary due to the seasonality of the purchasing and payment patterns of our customers. In addition, the timing of the recognition of revenue, the amount and timing of operating expenses, including employee compensation, sales and marketing activities, and capital expenditures, may vary from quarter-to-quarter which may cause our reported results to fluctuate significantly. In addition, we may choose to grow our business for the long-term rather than to optimize for profitability or cash flows for a particular shorter-term period. This seasonality or the occurrence of any of the factors above may cause our results of operations to vary and our financial statements may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. 
 Integration of recent acquisitions 
 We believe that our recent acquisitions result in certain benefits, including expanding our portfolio of software and products and enabling us to better serve our customers requests for data analytics and simulation technology. However, to realize some of these anticipated benefits, the acquired businesses must be successfully integrated. The success of these acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to realize these anticipated benefits. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions for a variety of reasons. 
 23 

Foreign currency fluctuations 
 Because of our substantial international operations, we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from our normal business operations, including in connection with our transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies, including the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan. To identify changes in our underlying business without regard to the impact of currency fluctuations, we evaluate certain of our operating results both on an as reported basis, as well as on a constant currency basis. For the remainder of our current fiscal year, we anticipate that our revenues and profit may be impacted by changes in foreign currency rates. 
 Business Segments 
 We have identified two reportable segments: Software and Client Engineering Services: 
 Software Our Software segment includes software and software related services. The software component of this segment includes our portfolio of software products including our solvers and optimization technology products, high-performance computing software applications and support, hardware products, modeling and visualization tools, data analytics and analysis products, IoT platform and analytics tools, as well as support and the complementary software products we offer through our Altair Partner Alliance, or APA. The APA includes technologies ranging from computational fluid dynamics and fatigue, to manufacturing process simulation and cost estimation. The software component of this segment includes consulting, training, and implementation services. The software related services component of this segment includes technical services focused on product design and development expertise and analysis from the component level up to complete product engineering at any stage of the lifecycle. 

Client Engineering Services Our client engineering services, or CES, segment provides client engineering services to support our customers with long-term, ongoing expertise. We operate our CES business by hiring engineers and data scientists for placement at a customer site for specific customer-directed assignments. We employ and pay them only for the duration of the placement.

The effective tax rate was 65 and 60 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The tax rate is affected by our status as a U.S. resident taxpayer, the tax rates in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, the relative amount of income earned by jurisdiction and the relative amount of losses or income for which no benefit or expense is recognized due to a valuation allowance. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 also includes net discrete benefit of 0.2 million and 4.4 million, respectively, primarily related to changes in tax laws, withholding taxes on royalties, changes in reserves, changes in accruals for unremitted earnings and other adjustments.

 Non-GAAP financial measures 
 We monitor the following key non-GAAP (United States generally accepted accounting principles) financial and operating metrics to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. In analyzing and planning for our business, we supplement our use of GAAP financial measures with non-GAAP financial measures, including Billings as a liquidity measure, Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and Free Cash Flow as a liquidity measure.

Billings. Billings consists of our total revenue plus the change in our deferred revenue, excluding deferred revenue from acquisitions during the period. Given that we generally bill our customers at the time of sale, but typically recognize a portion of the related revenue ratably over time, management believes that Billings is a meaningful way to measure and monitor our ability to provide our business with the working capital generated by upfront payments from our customers. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, interest income and other, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment charges and other special items as determined by management. Our management team believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure of performance as it is commonly utilized by management and the investment community to analyze operating performance in our industry. 
 Free Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure that we calculate as cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful in analyzing our ability to service and repay debt, when applicable, and return value directly to stockholders. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures included in the tables below, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures and are by definition an incomplete understanding of the Company and must be considered in conjunction with GAAP measures. 
 We believe that the non-GAAP measures disclosed herein are only useful as an additional tool to help management and investors make informed decisions about our financial and operating performance and liquidity. By definition, non-GAAP measures do not give a full understanding of the Company. To be truly valuable, they must be used in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized. It may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Recurring software license rate 
 A key factor to our success is our recurring software license rate, which we measure through Billings, primarily derived from annual renewals of our existing subscription customer agreements. The recurring software license rate is intended to convey the percentage of software billings that are recurring in nature. Recurring license streams allow us to create more consistent, predictable cash flows and drive greater long-term customer value. We believe the recurring software license rate is a key factor to our success and we monitor this measure to ensure our go-to-market strategy is driving long-term success of our business. 
 We calculate our recurring software license rate for a particular period by dividing (i) the sum of software term-based license Billings, software license maintenance Billings, and 20 of software perpetual license Billings which we believe approximates maintenance as an element of the arrangement by (ii) the total software license Billings including all term-based subscriptions, maintenance, and perpetual license billings from all customers for that period. The recurring software license rate was 92 and 94 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The recurring software license rate may vary from period to period. 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were 513.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and 200.0 million availability on our credit facility. We have outstanding debt in the form of our 2027 convertible notes 2027 Notes with a 230.0 million principal amount as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the period ended September 30, 2024, the conditions allowing holders of the 2027 Notes to convert were not met. Therefore, the 2027 Notes were classified as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. We have the ability to settle the 2027 Notes in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our own election. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 49.1 million remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program. 
 33 

We continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and other strategic transactions designed to expand our business. As a result, our expected uses of cash could change, our cash position could be reduced, or we may incur additional debt obligations to the extent we complete additional acquisitions or strategic transactions. 
 Our existing cash and cash equivalents may fluctuate during fiscal 2024 due to changes in our planned cash expenditures, including changes in incremental costs such as direct costs and integration costs related to acquisitions. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, the effects of geopolitical events. It is possible that certain customers may unilaterally decide to extend payments on accounts receivable, however our customer base is comprised primarily of larger organizations with typically strong liquidity and capital resources. 
 We believe that our existing cash balances, together with funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements for the next twelve months. We also believe that our financial resources, along with managing discretionary expenses, will allow us to manage our business operations for the foreseeable future and withstand geopolitical events, which could include reductions in revenue and delays in payments from customers and partners. We will continue to evaluate our financial position as developments evolve. 
 Revolving credit facility 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 2019 Amended Credit Agreement and there was 200.0 million available for future borrowing. The 2019 Amended Credit Agreement is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions. 
 For additional information about the 2019 Amended Credit Agreement, refer to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024. 
 Cash flows 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 513.4 million available for working capital purposes, acquisitions, and capital expenditures; 368.0 million of this amount was held in the United States and 138.0 million was held in the APAC and EMEA regions with the remainder held in Canada, Mexico, and South America. 
 Other than statutory limitations, there are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Altair. Based on our current liquidity needs and repatriation strategies, we expect that we can manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received proceeds of 25.5 million from the exercise of common stock options and made payments of 6.3 million for the repurchase of our Class A common stock. 
 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 There was a favorable effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an adverse effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Commitments 
 We settled the remaining balance of our 2024 convertible senior notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no other material changes in our commitments as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Recently issued accounting pronouncements 
 See Note 2 in the Notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 1, Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a full description of the recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to certain global market risks, including foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk associated with our revolving credit facility. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 As a result of our substantial international operations, we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from our normal business operations, including in connection with our transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, we translate sales and financial results denominated in foreign currencies into United States dollars for purposes of our consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of the United States dollar against these foreign currencies generally will have a negative impact on our reported revenue and operating income while depreciation of the United States dollar against these foreign currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported revenue and operating income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we do not have any foreign currency hedging contracts. Based on our current international operations, we do not plan on engaging in hedging activities in the near future. 
 35 

Market Risk and Market Interest Risk 
 In June 2022, we issued 230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.750 convertible senior notes due in 2027. The 2027 Notes have fixed annual interest rates at 1.750 and, therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on our 2027 Notes. However, the value of the 2027 Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate 2027 Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the 2027 Notes is affected by our stock price. The fair value of the 2027 Notes will generally increase as our Class A common stock price increases in value and will generally decrease as our Class A common stock price declines in value. We carry the 2027 Notes at face value less unamortized issuance costs on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 513.4 million, consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our 2019 Amended Credit Agreement. Such interest-bearing instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk; however, historical fluctuations of interest expense have not been significant. 
 Interest rate risk relates to the gain/increase or loss/decrease we could incur on our debt balances and interest expense associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income we realize on our invested cash balances. It is our policy not to enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes, and therefore, we hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in periodic reports filed with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. L egal Proceedings 
 Other legal proceedings 
 From time to time, we may be subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We have received, and may in the future continue to receive, claims from third parties asserting, among other things, infringement of their intellectual property rights. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves, our partners and our customers by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish and enforce our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 Risks Associated with the Proposed Transaction with Siemens 
 The proposed transaction with Siemens may be delayed or not occur at all for a variety of reasons, including that the Merger Agreement is terminated, and the failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock. 
 On October 30, 2024, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement with Siemens Industry Software Inc. Parent and Astra Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent Merger Sub ), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the Merger ), with Altair surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) the approval of the our stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the outstanding Common Shares entitled to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement, voting together as a single class, (ii) the absence of any order or law issued by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction prohibiting, rendering illegal or enjoining the consummation of the Merger, (iii) the expiration or termination of any waiting period (and any extensions thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and any commitment to, or agreement with, any governmental authority to delay or not consummate the Merger, and (iv) the receipt of all required consents, approvals, notifications or filings from or to any governmental authority under the antitrust and foreign investment laws of certain other jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that all required approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, if all required approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals or that the pending Merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed in the expected timeframe, or at all. 
 The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances, including that either party may terminate if the Merger is not completed by October 30, 2025, which may be extended to April 30, 2026 as provided in the Merger Agreement. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement, we, under specified circumstances, including our termination of the Merger Agreement to accept and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an unsolicited superior acquisition proposal or Parent s termination upon the change by our Board of Directors of its recommendation that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the Merger, in each case to the extent provided in the Merger Agreement, will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of 372.0 million. 
 Failure to complete the Merger within the expected timeframe or at all could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock in a number of ways, including: 
 the market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be consummated; 

if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, we would be required to pay a termination fee of 372.0 million; and 

we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses for professional services in connection with the Merger for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not consummated. 

37 

Efforts to complete the Merger could disrupt our relationships with third parties and employees, divert management s attention, or result in negative publicity or legal proceedings, any of which could negatively impact our operating results and ongoing business. 
 We have expended, and will continue to expend, significant management time and resources in an effort to complete the Merger, which may have a negative impact on our ongoing business and operations. Uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Merger and our future could disrupt our business relationships with our existing and potential customers, suppliers, service providers and other business partners, who may be more cautious in their arrangements with us or attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than Altair. Our employees may have concerns with respect to the Merger and uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Merger could also adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key personnel and other employees. The pendency of the Merger may also lead to litigation against us and our directors and officers. Such litigation would be distracting to management and, may, in the future, require us to incur significant costs. Such litigation could result in the Merger being delayed and/or enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, which could prevent the Merger from being completed. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternative transactions to the Merger which could discourage a potential competing acquirer from making an alternative transaction proposal. 
 The Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to be acquired by, or enter into certain combination transactions with, a third party. The Merger Agreement contains certain provisions that restrict our ability to, among other things, solicit alternative acquisition proposals, to furnish information to, and participate in discussions or negotiations with, third parties regarding any alternative acquisition proposals, subject to certain exceptions that allow our Board to comply with their fiduciary duties. In addition, following our receipt of any alternative transaction proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), Parent would have an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the Merger Agreement before our Board may withhold, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation with respect to the Merger and before we may terminate the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated by us to enter into a Superior Proposal or by Parent if our board withholds, qualifies. modifies in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation with respect to the Merger or takes certain similar actions, we would be required to pay a termination fee of 372.0 million to Parent, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 
 These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer or merger partner that might have an interest in acquiring or combining with all or a significant portion of us or pursuing an alternative transaction from considering or proposing such a transaction. 
 While the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities. 
 The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including, among others, covenants regarding the conduct of our business during the pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the Merger. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 On July 11, 2024, in connection with our acquisition of Metrics Design Automation, Inc., we issued an aggregate of 35,651 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock, par value 0.0001 per share to the stockholders of Metrics Design Automation, Inc. and agreed to issue to the stockholders of Metrics Design Automation, Inc. up to an additional 18,190 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock, par value 0.0001 per share, with 9,095 shares issuable on each of July 11, 2025 and July 11, 2026, subject to potential reduction in certain circumstances. All shares are subject to customary securities law restrictions on transferability. All shares were issued without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Metric Design Automation Inc. s stockholders provided customary representations for a private placement of securities and agreed to customary restrictions on transferability.
