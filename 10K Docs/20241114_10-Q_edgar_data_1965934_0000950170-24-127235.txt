For purposes of the Expense Support Agreement, Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share means the annualized rate (based on a 365 day year) of regular cash distributions per share exclusive of returns of capital, distribution rate reductions due to distribution and shareholder servicing fees, and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any. The Operating Expense Ratio is calculated by dividing Operating Expenses (as defined below), less organizational and offering expenses, management and incentive fees owed to the Advisor, shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees, and interest expense, by the Company s net assets. Operating Expenses means all of the Company s operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies. Either the Company or the Advisor may terminate the Expense Support Agreement at any time, with or without notice, without the payment of any penalty, provided that any Expense Payments that have not been reimbursed by the Company to the Advisor will remain the obligation of the Company following any such termination, subject to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement. Refer to Note 8 for the cumulative amount of expense support subject to potential reimbursement to the Advisor by the Company. Transactions with Affiliates On July 16, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with an affiliate to assign the rights and obligations of 25 of Triwest Healthcare Alliance Corp's million senior secured term loan and million senior secured delayed draw term loan. The funded portion of such loans amounted to an aggregate price of million. On August 20, 2024, the SEC granted the Company exemptive relief (the "Order") to co-invest alongside other funds/vehicles managed by the Advisor or its affiliates, or alongside the Advisor or its affiliates in a principal capacity, in a manner consistent with the Company s investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. As a result of the Order, there could be significant overlap in the Company's investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of other affiliates.

Ite m 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Financial Statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events, our future performance or financial condition and involves numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors outside of our control including, but not limited to, those set forth herein under Forward-Looking Statements and under Risk Factors in Item 1A of the Registration Statement (as defined below). Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in any forward-looking statements. Overview Overland Advantage (the Company, we, our, or us is a Delaware statutory trust structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company. The Company has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). The Company also has elected to be treated as a Regulated Investment Company RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). The Company s investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, predominantly in the form of current income, with select investments exhibiting the ability to capture long-term capital appreciation. The Company s investment strategy is primarily focused on newly-originated, privately-negotiated senior secured term loans in middle market non-sponsor companies, which are companies that are not backed by a private equity firm or other professional equity investor, and sponsor-owned companies, which are companies backed by such firm or person. Though no assurance can be given that the Company s investment objective will be achieved, and investment results may vary substantially on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis, the Company believes that the Company s investment objective can be achieved by primarily investing in newly-originated, privately-negotiated senior secured term loans in middle market non-sponsor and sponsor-owned companies with the potential of also investing in unsecured loans, subordinated loans, mezzanine loans and equity-related securities including warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company s common equity. In furtherance of its investment objective, the Company may also make investments in syndicated loans and other liquid credit opportunities, including in publicly traded debt instruments and other instruments that are not directly originated. The Company may invest without limit in originated or syndicated debt. The Company will target the following investment assets: (i) middle market corporate non-sponsor and sponsor owned companies; (ii) asset-based lending; and (iii) bespoke solutions. Middle market corporate opportunities will primarily consist of floating-rate senior secured first lien, unitranche, and second lien loans to middle market non-sponsor and sponsor owned companies. Senior secured first lien debt has first claim to any underlying collateral of a loan, unitranche loans are secured loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt into one tranche of debt, generally in a first lien position, and second lien loans are secured but subordinated in payment and/or lower in lien priority to first lien holders. In connection with a direct loan, the Company may also invest in warrants or other equity securities of borrowers and may receive non-cash income features, including payment-in-kind PIK interest and original issue discount OID ). 

 Asset-based opportunities will primarily consist of last-out or otherwise specialized asset-based financings, which are permitted to include opportunities to provide financing secured by hard assets, including, among other things, aircraft, ships, timber, real property, etc., intangible assets such as litigation claims and intellectual property claims or rights, and structured products such as collateralized loan obligations. 

 Bespoke solutions will include specialized junior capital solutions, including mezzanine debt, PIK notes, convertible debt and other unsecured debt instruments, structured debt that is not secured by financial or other assets, debtor-in-possession financings and equity in loan portfolios or portfolios of receivables and structured equity. 

 The Company expects that it will generally invest in floating rate instruments. The instruments in which the Company invests are not typically rated by any rating agency, but if these instruments were rated, they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB-or Baa3), which is an indication of having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the borrower s ability to pay interest and repay principal. Such below investment grade securities are often referred to as junk. The Company generally expects to invest in middle market companies with annual earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, ranging from 25 million to 100+ million, a substantial portion of which is expected to be non-sponsor owned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Advisor may determine whether companies qualify as middle market in its sole discretion, primarily based on analysis of the EBITDA of such companies, although other factors may be considered, and the Company may from time to time invest in larger or smaller companies if an attractive opportunity presents itself, especially when there are dislocations in the capital markets, including the high yield and syndicated loan markets. The investment size will vary with the size of the Company s capital base. The Company may invest without limit in originated or syndicated debt. 

 23 

Investments Our level of investment activity may vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of investment and capital expenditures of such companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Pursuant to rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), eligible portfolio companies include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than 250 million. As a BDC, we may also invest up to 30 of our portfolio opportunistically in non-qualifying portfolio investments, such as investments in non-U.S. companies. In addition, we may invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as junk have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Such investments may also be difficult to value and are illiquid. Revenues We expect to generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we will hold. In addition, we expect to generate income from various loan origination and other fees, dividends and capital appreciation on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights, and capital gains on the sales of investments. The companies in which we invest use our capital for a variety of reasons, including to support organic growth, to fund changes of control, to fund acquisitions, to make capital investments and for refinancing and recapitalizations. Leverage will be utilized to help the Company meet its investment objective. Any such leverage would be expected to increase the total capital available for investment by the Company. Expenses The Company will bear expenses relating to the organization of the Company and the private offering of Common Shares (the Private Offering and any subsequent offering of common share of beneficial interest, par value 0.001 per share, (the Common Shares ). Organizational expenses include, without limitation, the cost of formation, including legal fees related to the creation and organization of the Company and its subsidiaries, its and their related documents of organization and the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC. Offering expenses include, without limitation, legal, printing and other offering and marketing costs, including the fees of professional advisors, those associated with the preparation of the Company s registration statement on Form 10, as well as the preparation of a registration statement in connection with any subsequent offering of Common Shares, as well as the expenses of Centerbridge Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (together with its affiliates, as applicable, Centerbridge and a subsidiary of Wells Fargo Company (together with its subsidiaries, Wells Fargo in negotiating and documenting other arrangements with the initial investors of the Company. The Company will reimburse Centerbridge Services Group, LLC (the Administrator ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centerbridge Partners, L.P., for its costs and expenses, which may include an allocable portion of overhead incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement (the Administration Agreement ), including but not limited to rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions, and the Company's allocable portion of the costs of its Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, any of their respective staff who provide services to the Company, operations staff who provide services to the Company, and any internal audit staff, to the extent internal audit performs a role in the Company's internal control assessment.

Any sub-administrator will separately be compensated for performing sub-administrative services under the sub-administration agreement and the cost of such compensation, and any other costs or expenses under such agreement, will be in addition to the cost of any other services borne by the Company under the Administration Agreement. The Company s primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to Overland Advisors, LLC (the Advisor under the investment advisory agreement Investment Advisory Agreement ), the Company s allocable portion of overhead expenses under the Administration Agreement, and all other costs and expenses relating to the Company s operations and transactions, including: operational and organizational costs; the cost of calculating the Company s net asset value, including the cost and expenses of

 As part of the monitoring process, our Advisor as our valuation designee appointed in accordance with Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, has developed risk assessment policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments and rates each of them based on the following categories, which we refer to as Internal Risk Ratings. Key drivers of internal risk ratings include financial metrics, financial covenants, liquidity and enterprise value coverage. Pursuant to these risk policies, an Internal Risk Rating of 1 5, which is defined below, is assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. Investments rated 1 are viewed as having the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis, as the borrower is performing above underwriting expectations. The business trends since origination and risk factors for this investment are generally favorable. Investments rated 2 are viewed as having an acceptable level of risk similar to the risk at the time of origination. The borrower is operating generally in line with underwriting expectations, with little concern about the portfolio company s performance or ability to meet covenant requirements or interest payments. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a rating of 2. Investments rated 3 involve a borrower performing below underwriting expectations and indicates that the risk of the loan has increased since origination or acquisition. There may be concerns about the portfolio company s performance or ability to meet covenant requirements or interest payments. Investments rated 4 involve a borrower operating materially below underwriting expectations and indicates that the risk of the loan has increased materially since origination. The borrower may be out of compliance with debt covenants and loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 120 days past due). It is likely that we may not recover our initial cost basis upon exit. Investments rated 5 involve a borrower performing substantially below underwriting expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased significantly since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and there is significant risk that we may realize a substantial loss. The fair market value of the loan will be updated to the amount we anticipate will be recovered.

Furthermore, the Company received 12.6 million (since inception) in expense support from the Advisor (as described in Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Agreements and Related Party Transactions. ). Such expenses may be subject to reimbursement from the Company in the future. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company intends to generate cash from (i) future offerings of the Company s Common Shares or preferred shares, (ii) cash flows from operations and (iii) borrowings from banks or other lenders, including under the revolving credit facility (the MS Revolving Credit Facility with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc. MS and the revolving credit facility (the "SMTB Credit Facility") with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited, New York Branch SMTB ), as described in Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7. Borrowings. The Company will seek to enter into bank debt, credit facility or other financing arrangements on at least customary market terms; however, the Company cannot commit to do so. The Company s primary use of cash will be for (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying the Advisor), (iii) debt service of any borrowings and (iv) cash distributions to the holders of the Company s shares. Equity Activity On December 20, 2023, an affiliate of the Advisor contributed 10,000 25 per share) of capital to the Company in exchange for 400 shares of the Common Shares. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had executed subscription agreements for approximately 2.1 billion of Capital Commitments (as of which 1.8 billion remains unfunded as of September 30, 2024). On May 7, 2024, the Company had its initial closing and received capital contributions of approximately 194.0 million. On July 1, 2024 and September 30, 2024, the Company received capital contributions of approximately 10.3 million and 75.0 million, respectively. Contractual Obligations We have entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Advisor to provide us with investment advisory services and the Administration Agreement with the Administrator to provide us with administrative services. We have also entered into the Expense Support Agreement with the Advisor to provide us with support with respect to certain expenses and subject to reimbursement. Payments for investment advisory services under the Investment Advisory Agreements, reimbursements under the Administration Agreement and support and reimbursements under the Expense Support Agreement are described in Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Agreements and Related Party Transactions. On February 22, 2024, the Company, through its wholly-owned financing subsidiary Overland Financing MS, LLC, entered into the MS Revolving Credit Facility. Under the MS Revolving Credit Facility, MS has agreed to make available to Overland Financing MS, LLC a revolving loan facility in the maximum principal amount of up to 300 million. On June 6, 2024, certain terms, including the applicable margins, in the MS Revolving Credit Facility were amended. As of September 30, 2024, 225 million had been drawn 

 28 

under the MS Revolving Credit Facility. See also Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7. Borrowings. On July 10, 2024, the Company entered into the SMTB Credit Facility. Under the SMTB Credit Facility, SMTB has agreed to make available to the Company, a revolving credit facility secured by a first-priority interest in the capital commitments of the Company s shareholders (including Overland Advantage Feeder Fund, L.P., as the guarantor (the Guarantor )) and the Guarantor s shareholders, and certain related assets of up to 100 million. As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the SMTB Credit Facility. See also Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7. Borrowings. From time to time in the future, we may establish one or more additional credit facilities or enter into other financing arrangements to facilitate investments and the timely payment of our expenses. It is anticipated that any such credit facilities will bear interest at floating rates at to-be-determined spreads over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), or an alternative reference rate. We cannot assure Shareholders that we will be able to enter into a credit facility on favorable terms or at all. In connection with a credit facility or other borrowings, lenders may require us to pledge assets, commitments and/or drawdowns (and the ability to enforce the payment thereof) and may ask to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our investment portfolio contains and is expected to continue to contain debt investments in the form of delayed draw commitments, which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with underlying loan agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we held unfunded delayed draw term loans with a principal amount of 47.9 million. Critical Accounting Policies There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies discussed in the Amendment No. 2 to the Company s registration statement on Form 10, as filed with the SEC on April 19, 2024 (the Registration Statement ). Our critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as described in the Registration Statement. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Registration Statement. Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Valuation Risk We primarily invest in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and therefore, the Advisor, as the Company s valuation designee appointed in accordance with Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the Advisor s valuation committee and independent third-party valuation firm(s), and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. Interest Rate Risk We will be subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. In addition, the MS Revolving Credit Facility is subject to floating interest rates. See Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Borrowings . A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to (i) higher interest income from our floating rate debt investments, (ii) value declines for fixed interest rate investments we may hold and (iii) higher interest expense in connection with our credit facilities. Since the majority of our investments consist of floating rating investments, an increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult for borrowers to repay their loans, and a rise in interest rates may also make it easier for the Advisor to meet or exceed the quarterly threshold for Income-Based Fee as described in Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Agreements and Related Party Transactions .

The Federal Reserve commenced raising interest rates in March 2022. In a high interest rate environment, our cost of funds increases, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. The Federal Reserve left its benchmark rates steady in the first and second quarters of 2024, and it has indicated that any cuts to benchmark rates in the future will depend on better inflation reports. It is possible that the Federal Reserve s tightening cycle could result the United States moving into a recession, which would likely decrease interest rates. A prolonged reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in base rates, such as SOFR and other alternate rates, are not offset by corresponding increases in the spread over such base rate that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses, or a decrease in the interest rate associated with our borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, 100 of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at variable rates, which are generally SOFR and typically have durations of one to six months after which they reset to current market interest rates, and many of which are subject to interest rate floors. Further, our MS Revolving Credit Facility and bear interest at SOFR rates with no interest rate floors. The following table shows the estimated annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates to our loan portfolio and outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024, assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure.

 Although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net investment income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from those shown above. Because we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds as well as our level of leverage. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income or net assets. We may hedge against interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts or our MS Revolving Credit Facility subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currencies, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates or higher exchange rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates or investments denominated in foreign currencies. During the periods covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities or foreign currency derivatives hedging activities. Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), in accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost- benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures.

(b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
