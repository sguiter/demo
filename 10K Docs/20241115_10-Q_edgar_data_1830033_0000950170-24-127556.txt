As of September 30, 2024, PCT had million of Cash and cash equivalents, and million of Restricted cash. PCT also has a million revolving credit facility with Sylebra Capital (the Revolving Credit Facility that is currently unused and expires on March 31, 2026, per a recent amendment. See Note 3 - Notes Payable and Debt Instruments for further information. Through the first nine months of 2024, PCT has not yet reached meaningful production volumes, sales, or production of on-spec product. Currently, PCT is focused on customer sampling and qualifications and believes that this will lead to meaningful future sales. Also, during the third quarter, the Company initiated compounding operations to blend its resin with either post-industrial recycled material or virgin polypropylene, which is expected to improve product consistency and accelerate the product delivery to customers. PCT has experienced intermittent mechanical challenges during the commissioning process including, but not limited to, limits in the rates at which certain contaminants can currently be removed from the purification process, as well as challenges with sustaining continuous operations. Recently, PCT has been focused on the recovery and removal of polyethylene and other solids CP2 ), which impacts the ability to run higher volumes and produce consistent, high quality UPR resin. PCT has modified the CP2 removal system to remove higher volumes of CP2 more quickly and believes these changes enable us to produce higher volumes of on-spec product. The Company is currently testing the system improvements at various operating conditions to validate the new limits. On October 3, 2024, PCT funded million to a restricted escrow account related to the Augusta purification facility project. Further, as of September 30, 2024, and through the twelve months from the date of filing, PCT had additional committed capital related to the Augusta Facility of approximately million for long-lead equipment and pre-construction work. With additional project finance, the Company anticipates that it may make a higher level

PureCycle Technologies, Inc. NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED (Unaudited) 

 to million. Moreover, there are interest and principal payments of at least million, as well as other ongoing monthly costs associated with managing the Company and possible draws on the Revolving Credit Facility. Pursuant to the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 205-40, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management must evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. This evaluation does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management s plans that have not been fully implemented or are not within control of the Company as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, management evaluates whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management s plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. PCT believes that its current level of unrestricted liquidity is not sufficient to fund operations, fund outstanding commitments, and further its future growth plans. The conditions described above raise substantial doubt regarding PCT s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In an effort to alleviate these conditions, PCT is currently performing certain operational enhancements that are expected to correct the production issues with the Ironton Facility. Further, on March 5, 2024, PCT LLC purchased of the outstanding bonds (see Note 3 - Notes Payable and Debt Instruments for further information). Since the purchase of the outstanding bonds, PCT has, through a series of transactions, resold million at a price of per principal amount. As of September 30, 2024, there were million of outstanding bonds that PCT intends to, and has the ability to, re-market based on the need for additional liquidity. The re-marketing process may require the addition of certain covenants to enhance the marketability of the purchased Bonds. The ability to re-market the purchased bonds with any such additional new covenants would require a further amendment to, or waiver of, provisions included within the Revolving Credit Facility. After considering management s plans to mitigate these conditions, including operational progress and re-marketing of the Bonds, PCT believes this substantial doubt has been alleviated and it has sufficient liquidity to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. PCT s future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the funding mechanism and construction schedule of the Augusta Facility and other anticipated facilities outside the United States, build-out of multiple Feed PreP facilities, funding needs to support other business opportunities, funding for general corporate purposes, debt service and other challenges or unforeseen circumstances. As a low-revenue operating company, PCT continually reviews its cash outlays, pace of hiring, professional services and other spend, and capital commitments to proactively manage those needs in tandem with its cash balance. For future growth and investment, PCT expects to seek additional debt or equity financing from outside sources, which it may not be able to raise on terms favorable to PCT, or at all. If PCT is unable to raise additional debt or sell additional equity when desired, or if PCT is unable to manage its cash outflows, PCT s business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, any financing arrangement may have potentially adverse effects on PCT and/or its stockholders. Debt financing (if available and undertaken) will increase expenses, must be repaid regardless of

 written notice prior to the expiration of a lease term.

Therefore, the Company will classify the Series A Warrants as a liability pursuant to ASC 815. As of September 30, 2024, there were approximately million Series A Warrants outstanding. Refer to Note 10 Fair Value of Financial Instruments for further information. Series B Warrants On May 10, 2024, pursuant to the Series B Warrant Agreement, the Company issued Series B Warrants to Pure Plastic to purchase an aggregate of million shares of Common Stock. Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase whole share of the Common Stock at a price of per share any time after November 6, 2024, provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Common Stock. The warrants will expire on December 1, 2030. At any time following January 1, 2028, the Company may redeem the outstanding Series B Warrants in whole, but not in part, at a price of per warrant upon a minimum of days prior written notice of redemption, if and only if the last sale price of the Common Stock equals or exceeds per share for any -trading days within a -trading day period commencing after the Series B Warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.

The Company reviews available-for-sale investments for other-than-temporary impairment loss periodically. The Company considers factors such as the duration, severity and the reason for the decline in value, the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For debt securities, we also consider whether (i) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis and (ii) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company did t recognize any other-than-temporary impairment losses. All marketable securities with unrealized losses have been in a loss position for less than twelve months, and the Company does not anticipate any material losses upon maturity of these investments. The fair value for fixed-rate debt securities is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments and is classified as Level 2. The fair value for the Company's other securities holdings, primarily under commercial paper, equals the carrying value and is classified as Level 2.

 million to provide financial assurance related to its performance under a certain vendor contract, which expires at the earlier of satisfaction of the obligation, termination of the related vendor contract, or from issuance (subject to renewal within ). Effective July 1, 2024, the amount was increased from million to million. Effective October 3, 2024, the amount was decreased from million to million as a result of PCT funding a restricted escrow account. These financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness. Because PCT currently has no liability for these financial assurance instruments, they are not reflected in its consolidated balance sheets. Legal Proceedings PCT is subject to legal and regulatory actions that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The assessment as to whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and as to whether such loss or a range of such losses is estimable, often involves significant judgment about future events, and the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Other than as described below, there is no material pending or threatened litigation against PCT that remains outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Shareholder Securities Litigation Beginning on or about May 11, 2021, putative class action complaints were filed against PCT, certain senior members of management and others, asserting violations of federal securities laws under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaints generally allege that the applicable defendants made false and/or misleading statements in press releases and public filings regarding the Technology, PCT s business and PCT s prospects. The first putative class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida by William C. Theodore against PCT and certain senior members of management (the Initial Theodore Lawsuit ). The second putative class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida by David Tennenbaum against PCT, certain senior members of management and others (the Tennenbaum Lawsuit ). On July 14, 2021, the court granted a motion to consolidate the Initial Theodore and Tennenbaum Lawsuits (consolidated as the Consolidated Theodore Lawsuit and on July 27, 2021, Tennenbaum filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss his complaint without prejudice. On August 5, 2021, the Court entered an order appointing Mariusz Ciecko and Robert Ciecko as Co-Lead Plaintiffs Lead Plaintiffs and Pomerantz LLP as Lead Counsel. On April 2, 2024, the Company reached a tentative settlement of the Consolidated Theodore Lawsuit (the Securities Settlement ), which was memorialized in a Stipulation of Settlement dated May 6, 2024. Under the terms of the Securities Settlement, all known and unknown claims shall be settled for million in exchange for a complete release of the Company and the individually named defendants in each of the referenced matters. The Securities Settlement shall be funded by the remainder of the Company s self-insured retention under its directors and officers liability insurance policies applicable to the claims D O Insurance and contributions by various carriers comprising part of the D O Insurance tower available to the Company and defendants. On October 8, 2024, the Court entered a final order approving the Securities Settlement and resolving the Consolidated Theodore Lawsuit.

 million related to certain fee applications, change orders and amounts currently held in retainage by PCO, and, on June 21, 2023, filed a mechanics lien in Lawrence County, Ohio for the same sum. On July 20, 2023, PCO filed its Answer and Counterclaim, in which PCO contends that various deficiencies in DB s work resulted in damages to PCO in excess of DB s million Arbitration Demand, including, but not limited to, the following: DB s insufficient and incomplete engineering drawings and packages, insufficient and unorganized material management, insufficient and inefficient contractor management, insufficient and rudimentary schedule management, incomplete and inefficient procurement procedures, and that the Company was required to undertake significant re-work at additional cost resulting from DB s failure to adequately perform its obligations under the EPC Contract. On September 14, 2023, DB filed a motion with the AAA seeking to join ThermalTech Engineering, Inc., and ThermalTech Turnkey Solutions LLC, a subcontractor engaged by DB to provide engineering services for the Ironton Project. PCO and ThermalTech Engineering, Inc. have objected to the joinder and the matter remains pending. On August 30, 2023, DB filed a breach of contract claim against PCO and others in Lawrence County Ohio, alleging the same facts contained in its arbitration demand, as well as an action to foreclose on a lien filed in Lawrence County, Ohio. Concurrently DB requested the complaint be stayed pending the resolution of all issues in the arbitration. On December 12, 2023, defendant UMB Bank, N.A. UMB filed an Answer and Counterclaim against DB. On January 9, 2024, the Lawrence County Court granted DB s request for a stay of the lawsuit pending the resolution of the arbitration proceeding. On March 8, 2024, ISC Constructors, a DB subcontractor, filed an action in equity for unjust enrichment against PCO in Lawrence Co. Ohio Case # 240C000171. The lawsuit alleges in unpaid invoices and retainage. An arbitration claim for breach of contract, for the same amount, was filed by ISC Constructors in the AAA against DB. That arbitration action has been consolidated with the AAA arbitration between PCO and DB listed above. Recently PCO moved to stay the ISC lawsuit and consolidate it with the DB lawsuit which is currently stayed. PCO intends to vigorously defend itself against DB s claims and to pursue recovery of damages resulting from DB s failure to perform adequately under the EPC Contract. Given the stage of the arbitration, PCT cannot reasonably estimate at this time whether there will be any loss, or if there is a loss, the possible range of loss, that may result from the Arbitration Demand. Other Matters On February 3, 2023, the Company received a books and records demand pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, from a purported stockholder of the Company, in connection with the stockholder s

On February 5, 2024, and February 23, 2024, the Company received additional demand letters demanding that the Company initiate legal action against its officers, directors, or members of senior management for their alleged breach of fiduciary duties and take remedial measures for damages from alleged unjust enrichment and corporate waste. Collectively, the February 3, 2023, October 6, 2023, October 27, 2023, February 5, 2024, and February 23, 2024 demand letters shall be referred to as the Demand Letters . The claims asserted in the Demand Letters are included as part of the Derivative Settlement. On April 25, 2024, the Company received a litigation demand letter from a purported shareholder, Selim Piot, requesting that the Board take action against certain officers and directors. On May 6, 2024, Mr. Piot served a books and records demand and initiated a derivative action in the Chancery Court of Delaware captioned Piot v. Bouck, et al., No. 2024-0475-NAC (Del. Ch.). On May 21, 2024, Mr. Piot served another books and records demand. The claims asserted in Mr. Piot s demand letters and derivative action are substantially similar to those asserted in the Ayers and Brunson Derivative Lawsuits and the Demand Letters.

This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors in the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to we, us, our, and the Company are intended to mean the business and operations of PCT and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Overview 
 PureCycle Technologies, Inc. PCT or Company is a Florida-based corporation focused on commercializing a patented purification recycling technology (the Technology ), originally developed by The Procter Gamble Company P G ), for restoring waste polypropylene into resin, called ultra-pure recycled UPR resin, which has nearly identical properties and applicability for reuse as virgin polypropylene. PCT has a global license for the Technology from P G. PCT s goal is to create an important new segment of the global polypropylene market that will assist multinational entities in meeting their sustainability goals, providing consumers with polypropylene-based products that are sustainable, and reducing overall polypropylene waste in the world s landfills and oceans. 
 PCT s process includes two steps: Feed Pre-Processing Feed PreP and the use of PCT s recycling technology for purification. The Feed PreP step will collect, sort, and prepare polypropylene waste feedstock for purification. The purification step is a purification recycling process that uses a combination of solvent, temperature, and pressure to return the feedstock to near-virgin condition through a novel configuration of commercially available equipment and unit operations. The purification process puts the plastic through a physical extraction process using super critical fluids that both extract and filter out contaminants and purify the color, opacity, and odor of the plastic without changing the bonds of the polymer. By not altering the chemical makeup of the polymer, the Company is able to use significantly less energy and reduce production costs as compared to virgin resin. 
 The Ironton Facility 
 PCT commenced commissioning activities at its first commercial-scale plant in Lawrence County, Ohio (referred to herein as the Ironton Facility ), in April 2023, achieved mechanical completion of the plant and commenced pellet production from post-industrial and post-consumer materials later in 2023. The Ironton Facility leverages the existing infrastructure of PCT s pilot facility known as the Feedstock Evaluation Unit, which became operational in 2019, and the Ironton Facility is expected to have UPR resin capacity of approximately 107 million pounds per year when fully operational. Through the first nine months of 2024, PCT has not yet reached meaningful production volumes, sales, or production of on-spec product. Currently, PCT is focused on customer sampling and qualifications and believes that this will lead to meaningful future sales. Also, during the third quarter, the Company initiated compounding operations to blend its resin with either post-industrial recycled material or virgin polypropylene, which is expected to improve product consistency and accelerate the product delivery to customers. 
 42 

PureCycle Technologies, Inc. ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED 

 PCT has experienced intermittent mechanical challenges during the commissioning process including, but not limited to, limits in the rates at which certain contaminants can currently be removed from the purification process, as well as challenges with sustaining continuous operations. Recently, PCT has been focused on the recovery and removal of polyethylene and other solids CP2 ), which impacts the ability to run higher volumes and produce consistent, high quality UPR resin. PCT has modified the CP2 removal system to remove higher volumes of CP2 more quickly and believes these changes enable us to produce higher volumes of on-spec product. The Company is currently testing the system improvements at various operating conditions to validate the new limits. 
 The Augusta Facility 
 In July 2021, PCT reached an agreement with The Augusta Economic Development Authority AEDA to build its first U.S. facility with multiple lines for both Feed PreP and purification in Augusta, Georgia (the Augusta Facility ). PCT expects the approximately 200-acre location to eventually include up to eight production lines, which are expected to collectively have UPR resin production capacity of approximately 1 billion pounds per year. When fully operational, each purification line at the Augusta Facility is expected to have annual production capacity of approximately 130 million pounds of PCT s UPR resin. PureCycle has allocated 40 of the Augusta Facility output, for Lines 1 and 2, to existing customers and expects that additional offtake agreements will continue to be negotiated. 
 On June 30, 2023, PCT and the AEDA executed an Economic Development Agreement EDA related to the Company s plans to construct the Augusta Facility. Pursuant to the EDA, PCT expects to receive certain property tax abatement benefits as well as certain other incentives, including site infrastructure development assistance Incentive Benefits ). In order to receive the Incentive Benefits under Phase One (as defined below) of the Augusta Project (as defined below), PCT will be obligated to create 82 full-time jobs with investments of at least 440 million no later than December 31, 2026. Through September 30, 2024, PCT has invested approximately 95.9 million for pre-construction engineering and long-lead equipment for the benefit of Phase One investments. If PCT elects to activate the second phase of the Augusta Project, PCT will be required to create an additional 25 full-time jobs and investments of 295 million no later than December 31, 2028. To the extent PCT fails to achieve an average of 80 of the jobs and investment commitments in any year over the 20-years of each phase, PCT will be required to make a repayment to the AEDA of a pro rata portion of the total value of the Incentive Benefits received by PCT in such year. 
 Also on June 30, 2023, PCT entered into a series of agreements with the AEDA to construct phase one Phase One of the Augusta Facility. PCT is leasing 150 acres of land Real Property owned by the AEDA and will construct buildings, building equipment, and other structures (the Improvements on the land. PCT will also acquire and install the necessary processing, warehousing, and other equipment, as well as conveyors and pipelines (the Equipment , together with the Real Property and the Improvements, the Augusta Project ). The Improvements and Equipment will be transferred to the AEDA and leased back by PCT. As noted above, PCT anticipates that the first portion of Phase One will consist of one purification line and construction, which were commenced prior to the end of 2023. Also as noted above, construction of the first purification line must be completed by December 31, 2026. 
 The legal sale-leaseback structure provides the Incentive Benefits to PCT as lessee of the Augusta Project. PCT will remain the owner of the Improvements and Equipment for accounting purposes during the term of the lease as PCT will have the right to acquire title to the Augusta Project for a nominal amount during the term and at the conclusion of the arrangement, which has an initial expiration date in 2044. The payments PCT makes to the AEDA during the term of the arrangement are not otherwise expected to be material. 
 At the end of 2023, the Company commenced site preparation activities, including debris removal and site stabilization activities, and continued with payments to vendors for certain long lead-time equipment. Pursuant to 
 43 

PureCycle Technologies, Inc. ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED 

 the EDA, PCT must also show continuous construction progress, with regard to the first purification line under the first phase of the Augusta Project during 2024 or risk losing certain future Incentive Benefits. While the Company believes it has satisfied the contractual obligations regarding financing and construction of Phase One to date, the AEDA believes that it could seek to terminate the lease if PCT does not demonstrate further progress on Phase One. Market conditions remain challenging and have created uncertainty as to the timing or likelihood of success of the currently anticipated project financing for the Augusta Facility. As a result, PCT is currently pursuing various structures for project financing of the Augusta Facility. While PCT remains confident in its ability to finance the Augusta Facility, it is limiting its expenses and adjusting its timeline in light of this uncertainty. If PCT is unable to raise additional debt or equity, when desired, or on terms favorable to PCT, PCT s business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. 
 Feedstock Pricing 
 PCT sees a robust pipeline of demand for its recycled polypropylene and PCT is seeing market acceptance of its Feedstock+ pricing model for its UPR resin. The Feedstock+ pricing model divides the market cost of feedstock by a set yield-loss and adds a fixed price, which effectively passes on the cost of feedstock and de-risks PCT s operating margin volatility. 
 For the Ironton Facility, PCT s feedstock price was linked, in part, to changes in the Chemical Market Analysis, the index for virgin polypropylene, in a price schedule that contained a fixed, collared price around an index price range, which was further adjusted based on the percentage of polypropylene in the feedstock supplied. For the Augusta Facility and future purification facilities, PCT plans to link the feedstock price, in part, to the price of a no. 5 plastic bale of polypropylene as reported by recyclingmarkets.net Feedstock Market Pricing ). PCT will procure both feedstock in line with Feedstock Market Pricing as well as low value feedstocks that can be processed by PCT, below Feedstock Market Pricing for the Augusta Facility. 
 PreP Facilities 
 In conjunction with the Augusta Facility, PCT also plans to build and operate Feed PreP facilities in locations geographically near the feed sources to optimize PCT s supply chain economics. During the third quarter of 2022, PCT experienced challenges obtaining the necessary water and sewer permits to construct its first planned Feed PreP facility in Central Florida. PCT is evaluating its available recourses, including legal requirements and remedies with regard to its obligations for the remaining 8 years of its 11-year lease agreement for the Central Florida facility. PCT is also evaluating alternative preprocessing sites in other locations. Also, in October 2024, PCT commenced operations of a Feed PreP facility in Denver, Pennsylvania. Throughout the second half of 2021, PCT developed a feedstock processing system with advanced sorting capabilities that can handle various types of plastics in addition to polypropylene (designated as no. 5 plastic). PCT s enhanced sorting should allow PCT to process plastic bales between no. 1 and no. 7. PCT s new Feed PreP facilities will extract polypropylene and ship it to PCT s purification lines, while the non-polypropylene feed will be sorted, baled, and subsequently sold on the open market. 
 Letter of No Objection Submission and the Granting of FDA Food Packaging Clearances for Certain Feedstocks 
 On September 10, 2021, PCT filed for a U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA Letter of No Objection LNO ), for Conditions of Use A H. Conditions of Use describe the temperature and duration at which a material should be tested to simulate the way the material is intended to be used. Conditions of Use C H address many consumer product packaging requirements, including applications for hot filled and pasteurized, as well as room temperature, refrigerated and frozen applications. Generally speaking, Conditions of Use A and B relate to extreme temperature applications. The LNO submission also defines the feedstock sources for the Company s planned commercial recycling process, and this LNO submission pertained to (i) food grade post-industrial recycled feedstocks and (ii) food grade curbside post-consumer recycled feedstocks. 
 44 

PureCycle Technologies, Inc. ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED 

 The FDA confirmed receipt of the submission on September 13, 2021 and followed up with additional questions and requests for clarification in a letter received by PCT on January 7, 2022. PCT responded to the FDA s questions on February 17, 2022. 
 On September 6, 2022, PCT received two separate notifications from the FDA with respect to the following two feedstock sources: 
 (i) Food grade post-industrial recycled feedstocks: an FDA opinion letter approving Conditions of Use A H and 
 (ii) Food-grade post-consumer recycled feedstock from stadiums: an FDA LNO for Conditions of Use E G. 
 On June 11, 2024, the Company received an additional LNO from the FDA, which expands upon the previous LNO and allows use of PCT's UPR resin (to the extent made from food grade post-consumer recycled material) in contact with all food types under FDA's Conditions of Use A through H. This expansion provides PCT with the same Conditions of Use for its UPR resin as virgin polypropylene, which span from frozen food storage to microwaveable packaging. 
 The Company s FDA food contact grades are capable of being used for all food types per the conditions of use listed and per all applicable authorizations in the food contact regulations listed in the 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21). 
 The Company is conducting additional testing and plans to make further LNO submissions for additional post-consumer recycled feedstock sources and expanded Conditions of Use. 
 Future Expansion 
 On January 17, 2023, the Company announced that its first European purification facility will be in Antwerp, Belgium. On October 20, 2022, the Company executed a Joint Venture Agreement with SK geo centric Co., Ltd. ("SK"), to develop a UPR purification facility in Ulsan, South Korea. Effective October 25, 2024, the Company and SK agreed to discontinue the joint venture for a project that was intended to construct and operate a recycled polypropolene purification plan at the SKGC Ulsan site; coordinating multiple independent technologies on a single site proved to be too challenging for the overall project execution. The two sides are open to working together to find an alternative location in South Korea, pursuant to a Heads of Agreement executed in 2022. 
 The Company is also planning to expand its production capabilities into Asia through negotiation of a joint venture with Mitsui Co. Ltd. in Japan for in-country production and sales. Future expansion is dependent on successful completion of project financing. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 PCT generated an immaterial amount of revenue through the first nine months of 2024 and has not yet reached (i) significant continuous operational volumes at the Ironton Facility or (ii) significant revenue generation. 
 45 

PureCycle Technologies, Inc. ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED 

 Operating Costs 
 Operating expenses to date have consisted mainly of personnel costs (including wages, salaries and benefits) and other costs directly related to operations at PCT s operating facilities, including rent, depreciation, repairs and maintenance, utilities and supplies. Costs attributable to the design and development of the Ironton Facility, Augusta Facility, and Feed PreP facilities in Central Florida and Denver, Pennsylvania, are capitalized and, when placed in service, will be depreciated over the expected useful life of the asset. We expect our operating costs to increase as we continue to scale operations and increase headcount. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to the continuous improvement and enhancement of the Technology, the facilities and equipment that will use the Technology to purify recycled polypropylene, and the processes needed to collect, sort, and prepare feedstock for purification. These include mainly personnel costs, depreciation for long-lived assets, third-party consulting costs, and the cost of various recycled waste. We are increasing our in-house feedstock analytical capabilities, which will include additional supporting equipment and personnel. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our corporate, executive, finance and other administrative functions and professional services, including legal, audit and accounting services. We expect our selling, general, and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we scale headcount with the growth of our business, and as a result of operating as a public company, including compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), legal, audit, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities, and other administrative and professional services.

Operating costs 
 The increase for the nine month period was primarily attributable to higher depreciation expense related to assets supporting operations of 14.0 million, respectively, due primarily to placing the Ironton Facility assets in service in the second quarter of 2023 and increased operational site costs of 11.5 million, respectively, related to operating the Ironton Facility. Operational costs did not significantly change over the three month period. 
 46 

PureCycle Technologies, Inc. ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED 

 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development expenses did not significantly change period over period. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 The increase for the nine month period was principally attributable to 6.9 million higher legal and professional consulting fees primarily related to a legal settlements reached in the second and third quarters of 2024 and 2.1 million higher insurance costs, partially offset by 1.7 million lower employee costs and 0.5 million lower bonus costs due to lower headcount and 0.7 million lower taxes and licenses expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses did not significantly change over the three month period. 
 Interest expense 
 The increase for the three and nine month periods was attributable to additional financing incurred in the second and third quarters of 2023, including the closing of the 250.0 million of green convertible senior notes in August 2023, as well as ceasing capitalization of interest on the Revenue Bonds (as defined below) beginning in June 2023 as the plant is now in service. 
 Interest income 
 The decrease for the three and nine month periods was primarily attributable to the Company's liquidation of the available-for-sale investment portfolio earlier in 2024. 
 Change in fair value of warrants 
 The increased expense for the three and nine month periods was attributable to the change in fair value of the Company s liability-classified warrants, of which the primary drivers of the change in valuation related to changes in the underlying price of PCT s common stock, as well as an increase in the number of warrants in 2024. 
 Loss on debt extinguishment 
 The amount reported in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relates to the loss recorded on the purchase of the majority of the outstanding Revenue Bonds in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Other expense 
 The increased expense for the nine month period was attributable to the 0.4 million change in derivative fair value in the third quarter of 2024. Other expense did not significantly change over the three month period. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 During 2023 and through September 30, 2024, PCT commenced commercial operations and sold an immaterial amount of resin and has not yet reached significant continuous operational volumes. PCT s ongoing operations have, to date, been funded by a combination of equity financing through the issuance of units and the issuance of various debt instruments. On September 11, 2024, the Company entered into subscription agreements with certain investors pursuant to which it sold, in a private placement, approximately 90 million in the aggregate and before deducting fees and other estimated offering expenses of (i) Series A Preferred Stock, par value 0.001 per share ("Series A Preferred Stock"); (ii) Common Stock and (iii) Series C Warrants. The following is a summary of the components of our current liquidity. The Debt Securities Available for Sale represent investment holdings in highly liquid debt securities and commercial paper with an average maturity of less than one year. As of December 31, 2023, Restricted cash consisted primarily of certain amounts required for the Series 2020A Bonds and other initial

 construction commitments for the Augusta Facility. On March 5, 2024, a subsidiary of the Company purchased 99 of the outstanding bonds (as defined below) which, among other things, released Restricted Cash to be used to purchase the Bonds. See Indebtedness Revenue Bonds for more information.

As of September 30, 2024, PCT had 83.7 million of Cash and cash equivalents and 10.0 million of Restricted cash. PCT also has a 200.0 million revolving credit facility with Sylebra Capital (the Revolving Credit Facility that is currently unused and expires on March 31, 2026, per a recent amendment described below. 
 Through the first nine months of 2024, PCT has not yet reached meaningful production volumes, sales, or production of on-spec product. Currently, PCT is focused on customer sampling and qualifications and believes that this will lead to meaningful future sales. Also, during the third quarter, the Company initiated compounding operations to blend its resin with either post-industrial recycled material or virgin polypropylene, which is expected to improve product consistency and accelerate the product delivery to customers. 
 PCT has experienced intermittent mechanical challenges during the commissioning process including, but not limited to, limits in the rates at which certain contaminants can currently be removed from the purification process, as well as challenges with sustaining continuous operations. Recently, PCT has been focused on the recovery and removal of polyethylene and other solids CP2 ), which impacts the ability to run higher volumes and produce consistent, high quality UPR resin. PCT has modified the CP2 removal system to remove higher volumes of CP2 more quickly and believes these changes will enable us to produce higher volumes of on-spec product. The Company is currently testing the system improvements at various operating conditions to validate the new limits. 
 On October 3, 2024, PCT funded 35.9 million to a restricted escrow account related to the Augusta purification facility project. Further, as of September 30, 2024, and through the twelve months from the date of filing, PCT had additional committed capital related to the Augusta Facility of approximately 11.0 million for long-lead equipment and pre-construction work. With additional project finance, the Company anticipates that it may make a higher level of investment in 2025 to further the construction of the Augusta Facility. Also remaining are final investments in the Ironton Facility of approximately 5.0 to 8.0 million. Moreover, there are interest and principal payments of at least 60.6 million, as well as other ongoing monthly costs associated with managing the Company and possible draws on the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 48 

PureCycle Technologies, Inc. ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED 

 PCT believes that its current level of unrestricted liquidity is not sufficient to fund operations, outstanding commitments, and further its future growth plans. The conditions described above raise substantial doubt regarding PCT s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See Note 1 - Organization - Liquidity and Going Concern for further information. 
 In an effort to alleviate these conditions, PCT is currently performing certain operational enhancements that are expected to correct the production issues with the Ironton Facility. Further, on March 5, 2024, PureCycle Technologies LLC ("PCT LLC") purchased 99 of the outstanding Bonds (as defined below). Since the purchase of the outstanding Bonds, PCT has, through a series of transactions described below, resold 116.8 million of Bonds at a purchase price of 800 per 1,000 principal amount. As of September 30, 2024, there were 117.6 million of outstanding Bonds that PCT intends to, and has the ability to, re-market based on the need for additional liquidity. The re-marketing process may require the addition of certain covenants to enhance the marketability of the purchased Bonds. The ability to re-market the purchased Bonds with any such additional new covenants would require a further amendment to, or waiver of, provisions included within the Revolving Credit Facility. After considering management s plans to mitigate these conditions, including operational progress and re-marketing of the Bonds, PCT believes this substantial doubt has been alleviated and it has sufficient liquidity to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. 
 PCT s future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the funding mechanism and construction schedule of the Augusta Facility and other anticipated facilities outside the United States, build-out of multiple Feed PreP facilities, funding needs to support other business opportunities, funding for general corporate purposes, debt service, and other challenges or unforeseen circumstances. As a low-revenue operating company, PCT continually reviews its cash outlays, pace of hiring, professional services and other spend, and capital commitments to proactively manage those needs in tandem with our available unrestricted cash balance. For future growth and investment, PCT expects to seek additional debt or equity financing from outside sources, which it may not be able to raise on terms favorable to PCT, or at all. If PCT is unable to raise additional debt or sell additional equity when desired, or if PCT is unable to manage its cash outflows, PCT s business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, any financing arrangement may have potentially adverse effects on PCT and/or its stockholders. Debt financing (if available and undertaken) will increase expenses, must be repaid regardless of operating results and may involve restrictions limiting PCT s operating flexibility. If PCT consummates an equity financing to raise additional funds, the percentage ownership of its existing stockholders will be reduced, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the current holders of PCT s Common Stock. 
 PCT has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. PCT does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or interests in variable interest entities that would require consolidation. Note that while certain legally binding offtake arrangements have been entered into with customers, these arrangements are not unconditional and definite agreements subject only to customer closing conditions, and do not qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements required for disclosure.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 The 51.7 million increase in net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to higher interest payments on debt of 31.1 million (including 17.7 million paid for the green convertible notes and 5.9 million in outstanding interest paid in connection with the purchase of the Revenue Bonds in March 2024), an increase in cash payments related to operating expenses of 22.1 million primarily driven by increased operational site costs at the Ironton Facility as well as higher legal and professional consulting fees primarily related to the payout of legal settlements in the second and third quarters of 2024. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 The 69.9 million increase in cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was attributable to 108.7 million lower capital expenditure payments, offset by 18.6 million higher investment purchases and 20.2 million lower maturities and sales of investments. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 The 383.7 million increase in net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to 253.2 million paid to purchase the outstanding Revenue Bonds and a decrease of 225.2 million in proceeds from debt, partially offset by 90.0 million in preferred stock proceeds. 
 Indebtedness 
 There have been no material changes regarding the Company's indebtedness from the information we provided in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as outlined in the information below. Refer to Note 3 - Notes Payable and Debt Instruments to the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the Company's outstanding indebtedness.

The Purchase was determined to be an extinguishment of the underlying debt obligation due to PCO being a wholly owned subsidiary of the Guarantor. As of September 30, 2024, there were 117.6 million of outstanding Bonds that PCT intends to, and has the ability to, re-market based on the need for additional liquidity. The re-marketing process may require the addition of certain covenants to enhance the marketability of the purchased Bonds.

 On May 10, 2024, Pure Plastic executed the Payoff and Release Letter, which memorialized the exchange of the Company s obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. Refer to "Revenue Bonds Issued to Related Party" section above for further discussion. 
 Financial Assurance 
 On March 14, 2024, PCT renewed a surety bond in the amount of 25.0 million to provide financial assurance related to its performance under a certain vendor contract, which expires at the earlier of satisfaction of the obligation, termination of the related vendor contract, or one year from issuance (subject to renewal within one year). Effective July 1, 2024, the amount was increased from 25.0 million to 45.9 million. Effective October 3, 2024, the amount was decreased from 45.9 million to 8.1 million as a result of PCT funding a restricted escrow account. 
 These financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness. Because PCT currently has no liability for these financial assurance instruments, they are not reflected in its consolidated balance sheets. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information we provided in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
