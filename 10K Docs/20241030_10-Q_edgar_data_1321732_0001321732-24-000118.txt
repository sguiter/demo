As of September 30, 2024, the Company s non-marketable available-for sale debt securities were not in an unrealized loss position. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, allowance for credit losses was recorded and instead the unrealized losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

 Non-Marketable Investments 
 During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company completed a strategic investment in a privately held company. Under the terms of the investment, the Company paid million in exchange for shares of Series B preferred stock which represented an immaterial investment in the outstanding equity securities of the privately held company. The Company determined that the investment did not meet the criteria to be accounted for as an equity method investment under ASC 323. The investment was accounted for as an available-for-sale debt security in accordance with ASC 320 as the preferred stock contains a contingent redemption feature at the Company s option. The investment is included in other non-current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet and changes in fair value are recorded in total other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: 
 Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

 Goodwill Impairment Review 
 The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually on October 31, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred. The Company operates as segment, which is the sole reporting unit of the Company, and therefore goodwill is tested for impairment at the consolidated level. Accordingly, when assessing whether an impairment test is required more frequently than on its annual testing date, the Company considers whether events or circumstances have taken place that indicate it is more likely than not that the Company s enterprise fair value is less than the carrying amount of its reporting unit, including goodwill. Due to the impairment of the Immersive Healthcare asset group during the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company assessed the reporting unit for impairment and determined there was no impairment of goodwill. The Company also determined there were no impairment indicators as of September 30, 2024.

 Contingencies

 Indemnification 
 The Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. In many such arrangements, the Company agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property

 Stock-based Compensation 
 Stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units RSUs ), RSUs with performance conditions PSUs ), stock options, and the Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP ). 
 Certain PSUs granted to senior management during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, will vest subject to the achievement of pre-established financial performance targets for the year ending December 31, 2024, and continued service. The fair value of these PSUs is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation costs associated with these PSUs are recognized over the requisite service period of years using graded vesting which results in more accelerated expense recognition compared to traditional time-based vesting over the same vesting period. Each reporting period, the Company monitors the probability of achieving the performance targets and may adjust periodic stock-based compensation expense based on its determination of the likelihood of achieving these performance targets and the estimated number of shares of common stock that will vest. The actual number of PSUs awarded is based on the actual performance during the performance period compared to the performance targets.

 million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which was primarily due to tax expenses attributable to its worldwide profits and a discrete tax charge resulting from non-deductible acquired in-process research and development expense associated with the asset acquisition, offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation attributable to its U.S. jurisdiction. 
 The Company s effective tax rate decreased to for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a discrete tax charge resulting from the non-deductible acquired in-process research and development expense associated with an asset acquisition in 2023. The effective tax rate increased to for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decrease in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation attributable to the U.S. jurisdiction in 2024. 
 Significant domestic deferred tax assets DTAs were generated in recent years, primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units. The Company evaluates all available positive and negative evidence, objective and subjective in nature, in each reporting period to determine if sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize the benefits of its DTAs and, if not, a valuation allowance to reduce the DTAs is recorded. As of September 30, 2024, the Company maintains a valuation allowance primarily against its California R D tax credit DTAs for which the Company does not believe a tax benefit is more likely than not to be realized due to the computation of California taxes under the single sales factor and non-conformity of the Section 174 capitalization rule.

 Performance Obligations 
 Delivery of products - The Company s contracts with customers, other than the China licensing arrangements described below, typically contain a single performance obligation, delivery of the Company s products. Satisfaction of that performance obligation occurs when control of the promised goods transfers to the customer, which is generally upon shipment or receipt by customer for non-consignment sale agreements and upon utilization for consignment sale agreements. 
 Payment terms - The Company s payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer. The timing between fulfillment of performance obligations and when payment is due is not significant and does not give rise to financing transactions. The Company did not have any contracts with significant financing components as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Contract liabilities 
 Contract assets for the periods presented primarily represent the difference between the revenue that was recognized based on the relative standalone selling price of the related performance obligations satisfied and the contractual billing terms in the licensing arrangements. 
 Contract liabilities represents amounts that the Company has already invoiced and are ultimately expected to be recognized as revenue, but for which not all revenue recognition criteria have been met and is recognized as the associated performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 relating to contract liabilities as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. 
 China Distribution and Technology Licensing Agreement 
 In December 2020, the Company entered into a distribution and technology licensing arrangement with its existing distribution partner in China. In addition to modifying the Company s standard distribution agreement with its partner in China, the Company agreed to license the technology for certain products to its partner in China to permit the manufacturing and commercialization of such products in China as well as provide certain regulatory support. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company further amended the distribution agreement and entered into an additional license arrangement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to license the technology for additional products to its partner in China on substantially the same terms as the existing license arrangement. Apart from the standard distribution agreement, the Company will receive fixed payments upon transferring its distinct licensed technology and providing related regulatory support. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company entered into an additional licensing arrangement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to license the technology for additional products to its partner in China and will receive fixed payments upon transferring its distinct licensed technology and providing related regulatory support and royalty payments on the down-stream sale of the licensed products. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company entered into another licensing

 Overview 
 References herein to we, us, our, the Company, and Penumbra, refer to Penumbra, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise. 
 Penumbra, the world s leading thrombectomy company, is focused on developing the most innovative technologies for challenging medical conditions such as ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism such as pulmonary embolism, and acute limb ischemia. Our broad portfolio, which includes computer assisted vacuum thrombectomy (CAVT), centers on removing blood clots from head-to-toe with speed, safety and simplicity. Our team focuses on developing, manufacturing and marketing novel products for use by specialist physicians and healthcare providers to drive improved clinical and health outcomes. We believe that the cost-effectiveness of our products is attractive to our customers. 
 Since our founding in 2004, we have invested heavily in our product development and commercial expansion that has established the foundation of our global organization. We have successfully developed, obtained regulatory clearance or approval for, and introduced products into the thrombectomy market since 2007, access market since 2008, embolization market since 2011, and neurosurgical market since 2014, and operated in the immersive healthcare market from 2020 until September 2024. 
 We expect to continue to develop and build our portfolio of products, including our thrombectomy, embolization and access technologies, while iterating on our currently available products. Generally, when we introduce a next generation product or a new product designed to replace a current product, sales of the earlier generation product or the product replaced decline. Our research and development activities are centered around the development of new products and clinical activities designed to support our regulatory submissions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our products. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made the strategic decision to explore alternative avenues for our Immersive Healthcare business, and as a result we recorded an impairment charge of 110.3 million related to our Immersive Healthcare asset group. Refer to Note 4. Impairment and Restructuring Costs of Immersive Healthcare Asset Group to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more details. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we permanently ceased sales of our Immersive Healthcare products and related commercial operations. 
 To address the challenging and significant clinical needs of our key markets, we have developed products that fall into the following broad product families: 
 25 

Table of Contents 

Our thrombectomy products fall into two broad product families: 
 Peripheral thrombectomy - INDIGO System, including Lightning, Bolt and CAT RX, designed for continuous or modulated aspiration, computer assisted vacuum thrombectomy, including aspiration catheters, microprocessor-controlled software algorithms that orchestrate the interaction of our pump and catheters, separators, aspiration pump and accessories, including delivery catheters used in peripheral thrombectomy procedures 
 Neuro thrombectomy - Penumbra System, including Penumbra RED, JET, ACE, BMX, and MAX catheters and the 3D Revascularization Device, Penumbra ENGINE and other components and accessories 
 Our embolization and access products fall into four broad product families: 
 Peripheral embolization - RUBY Coil System, Ruby LP, LANTERN Delivery Microcatheter and the POD System (POD and POD Packing Coil) 
 Neuro embolization - Penumbra SMART COIL, Penumbra Coil 400, POD400, PAC400 and SwiftPAC Coil 
 Access - delivery catheters, consisting of Neuron, Neuron MAX Select, BENCHMARK, BMX, DDC, PX SLIM, SENDit and MidWay 
 Neurosurgical - Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device 
 By pioneering these innovations, we support healthcare providers, hospitals and clinics in more than 100 countries, working to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 25.6 and 28.5 of our revenue, respectively, was generated from customers located outside of the United States. Our sales outside of the United States are denominated principally in the euro, with some sales being denominated in other currencies. As a result, we have foreign exchange exposure but do not currently engage in hedging. 
 We generated revenue of 879.1 million and 773.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 105.3 million. We generated a loss from operations of 33.5 million and income from operations of 38.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 There are a number of factors that have impacted, and we believe will continue to impact, our results of operations and growth. These factors include: 
 The rate at which we grow our salesforce and the speed at which newly hired salespeople become fully effective can impact our revenue growth or our costs incurred in anticipation of such growth. 
 Our industry is intensely competitive and, in particular, we compete with a number of large, well-capitalized companies. We must continue to successfully compete in light of our competitors existing and future products and their resources to successfully market to the specialist physicians who use our products. 
 We must continue to successfully introduce new products that gain acceptance with specialist physicians and other healthcare providers and successfully transition from existing products to new products, ensuring adequate supply. In addition, as we introduce new products and expand our production capacity, we anticipate additional personnel will be hired and trained to build our inventory of components and finished goods in advance of sales, which may cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition. 
 Publications of clinical results by us, our competitors and other third parties can have a significant influence on whether, and the degree to which, our products are used by specialist physicians and the procedures and treatments those physicians choose to administer for a given condition. 
 The specialist physicians who use our interventional products may not perform procedures during certain times of the year, such as those periods when they are at major medical conferences or are away from their practices for other reasons, the timing of which occurs irregularly during the year and from year to year. 
 Most of our sales outside of the United States are denominated in the local currency of the country in which we sell our products. As a result, our revenue from international sales can be significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 The availability and levels of reimbursement within the relevant healthcare payment system for healthcare providers for procedures in which our products are used. 
 26 

Table of Contents 

In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience meaningful variability in our quarterly revenue, gross profit and gross margin percentage as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the number of available selling days, which can be impacted by holidays; the mix of products sold; the geographic mix of where products are sold; the demand for our products and the products of our competitors; the timing of or failure to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances for products; increased competition; the timing of customer orders; inventory or other asset write-offs or write-downs; costs, benefits and timing of new product introductions; costs, benefits and timing of the acquisition and integration of businesses and product lines we may acquire; the availability and cost of components and raw materials; and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We may experience quarters in which we have significant revenue growth sequentially followed by quarters of moderate or no revenue growth. Additionally, we may experience quarters in which operating expenses, in particular research and development expenses, fluctuate depending on the stage and timing of product development. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue. We sell our interventional products directly to hospitals and other healthcare providers and through distributors for use in procedures performed by specialist physicians to treat patients in two key markets: thrombectomy and embolization and access. We sell our products through purchase orders, and we do not have long term purchase commitments from our customers. Revenue from product sales is recognized either on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer, but is deferred for certain transactions when control has not yet transferred. With respect to products that we consign to hospitals, which primarily consist of coils, we recognize revenue at the time hospitals utilize products in a procedure. Revenue also includes shipping and handling costs that we charge to customers. 
 Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of raw materials and components, personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, inbound freight charges, receiving costs, inspection and testing costs, warehousing costs, royalty expense, shipping and handling costs, and other labor and overhead costs incurred in the manufacturing of products. We manufacture substantially all of our products in our manufacturing facilities in Alameda and Roseville, California. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development R D ). R D expenses primarily consist of product development, clinical and regulatory expenses, materials, depreciation and other costs associated with the development of our products. R D expenses also include salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel and consultants. We expense R D costs as they are incurred. 
 Sales, General and Administrative SG A ). SG A expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel and consultants engaged in sales, marketing, finance, legal, compliance, administrative, facilities and information technology and human resource activities. Our SG A expenses also include marketing trials, medical education, training, commissions, generally based on sales, to direct sales representatives, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs. 
 Income Taxes 
 We are taxed at the rates applicable within each jurisdiction in which we operate. The composite income tax rate, tax provisions, deferred tax assets DTAs and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the respective governmental taxing authorities, and require us to exercise judgment in determining our income tax provision, our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and the potential valuation allowance recorded against our net DTAs. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the DTAs will not be achieved.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Certain changes in presentation were made to the Company s revenues disaggregated by product categories for the period ended September 30, 2023 to conform to the presentation for the period ended September 30, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company made changes to its product categories to provide investors with more meaningful information to understand the performance of its business and strategic direction. 
 Revenue Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 (in thousands, except for percentages) Thrombectomy 204,141 179,080 25,061 14.0 Embolization and Access 96,898 91,866 5,032 5.5 Total 301,039 270,946 30,093 11.1 
 Revenue increased 30.1 million, or 11.1 , to 301.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 270.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Overall revenue growth was primarily due to an increase in sales of our existing thrombectomy products. 
 Revenue from our global thrombectomy products increased 25.1 million, or 14.0 , to 204.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 179.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our global thrombectomy products was primarily attributable to higher sales volume in the United States as a result of further market penetration of our existing products. Sales of our U.S. thrombectomy products increased by 21.2 in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Prices for our thrombectomy products remained substantially unchanged during the period. 
 Revenue from our global embolization and access products increased 5.0 million, or 5.5 , to 96.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 91.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our global embolization and access products was primarily driven by sales of our U.S. embolization and access products, which increased by 5.3 in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Prices for our embolization and access products remained substantially unchanged during the period.

 Revenue from product sales in international markets decreased 1.4 million, or 1.9 , to 74.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 76.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from international sales represented 24.8 and 28.1 of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Gross Margin 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 (in thousands, except for percentages) Cost of revenue 100,733 93,228 7,505 8.1 Gross profit 200,306 177,718 22,588 12.7 Gross margin 66.5 65.6 
 Gross margin increased by 0.9 percentage points to 66.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 65.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin is impacted by product mix, regional mix, and production initiatives to support demand and create future efficiencies. As such, with favorable product mix, improvement in productivity, and by leveraging our fixed costs on higher volume of new product sales during the year, our gross margin may be positively impacted in the future. Our manufacturing team will focus on ramping up our volume, while driving our productivity and efficiency for our new product launches expected in the fourth quarter. 
 Research and Development R D Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 (in thousands, except for percentages) R D 25,205 20,958 4,247 20.3 R D as a percentage of revenue 8.4 7.7 
 R D expenses increased by 4.2 million, or 20.3 , to 25.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 21.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to 2.6 million of one-time expenses in connection with the wind down of the Immersive Healthcare business and a 0.8 million increase in personnel-related expenses. 
 As a result of the wind down of the Immersive Healthcare business, we expect to create R D expense savings of approximately 17.0 million per year moving forward. We have continued to make investments, and plan to continue to make investments, in the development of our products. As part of our ongoing investment in the development of our products, we may incur additional expenses related to research and development milestones. In addition, we have experienced in the past, and may continue to experience in the future, variability in expenses incurred due to the timing and costs of clinical trials and product development, which may include additional personnel-related expenses in conjunction with the launch of new products.

Sales, General and Administrative SG A Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 (in thousands, except for percentages) SG A 139,737 125,920 13,817 11.0 SG A as a percentage of revenue 46.4 46.5 
 SG A expenses increased by 13.8 million, or 11.0 , to 139.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 125.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 6.9 million increase in personnel-related expenses driven by an increase in headcount and related expenses to support our growth, 2.3 million of one-time expenses in connection with the wind down of the Immersive Healthcare business, a 2.1 million increase in other professional services, and a 1.9 million increase in costs related to marketing events. This was partially offset by a 2.4 million decrease in amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the Sixense acquisition due to the impairment of long-lived assets associated with the Immersive Healthcare business in the second quarter of 2024. 
 As a result of the wind down of the Immersive Healthcare business, we expect to create SG A expense savings of approximately 23.0 million per year moving forward. As we continue to invest in our growth, we have expanded and may continue to expand our sales, marketing, and general and administrative teams through the hiring of additional employees in critical roles that support our strategic initiatives. In addition, we have experienced in the past, and may continue to experience in the future, variability in expenses incurred due to the timing and costs of investments to support the business.

 There were no acquired IPR D charges during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the third quarter of the prior year, we recorded an 18.2 million acquired IPR D charge in connection with an asset acquisition. Refer to Note 6. Asset Acquisition to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more details. 
 Provision for income taxes Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 (in thousands, except for percentages) Provision for income taxes 10,251 4,090 6,161 150.6 Effective tax rate 25.8 30.7 
 Our provision for income taxes was 10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily due to tax expenses attributable to our worldwide profits. Our provision for income taxes was 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to tax expenses attributable to our worldwide profits and a discrete tax charge resulting from the non-deductible IPR D charge associated with an asset acquisition, offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation attributable to our U.S. jurisdiction. 
 Our effective tax rate decreased to 25.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 30.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to tax expense associated with the non-deductible acquired in-process research and development expenses in 2023. 
 Prospectively, our effective tax rate will likely be driven by (1) permanent differences in taxable income for tax and financial reporting purposes, (2) tax expense or benefit attributable to our worldwide financial result, and (3) discrete tax adjustments such as excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to stock-based compensation. Our income tax provision is subject to volatility as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies can fluctuate from period to period based on the price of our stock, the volume of share-based grants settled or vested, and the fair value assigned to equity awards under U.S. GAAP. In

Impairment and Restructuring Costs of Immersive Healthcare Asset Group to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more details), which compares to 64.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The impact of the one-time 33.4 million charge decreased our gross margin by 3.8 percentage points in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Gross margin is impacted by product mix, regional mix, and production initiatives to support demand and create future efficiencies. As such, with favorable product mix, improvement in productivity, and by leveraging our fixed costs on higher volume of new product sales during the year, our gross margin may be positively impacted in the future. Our manufacturing team will focus on ramping up our volume, while driving our productivity and efficiency for our new product launches expected in the fourth quarter. 
 Research and Development R D 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 (in thousands, except for percentages) R D 74,773 62,481 12,292 19.7 R D as a percentage of revenue 8.5 8.1 
 R D expenses increased by 12.3 million, or 19.7 , to 74.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 62.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 4.0 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a 2.9 million increase in product development and testing costs, and 2.6 million in one-time expenses in connection with the wind down of the Immersive Healthcare business. 
 As a result of the wind down of the Immersive Healthcare business, we expect to create R D expense savings of approximately 17.0 million per year moving forward. We have continued to make investments, and plan to continue to make investments, in the development of our products. As part of our ongoing investment in the development of our products, we may incur additional expenses related to research and development milestones. In addition, we have experienced in the past, and may continue to experience in the future, variability in expenses incurred due to the timing and costs of clinical trials and product development, which may include additional personnel-related expenses in conjunction with the launch of new products.

 SG A expenses increased by 49.6 million, or 13.2 , to 426.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 376.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 20.6 million increase in personnel-related expense driven by an increase in headcount and related expenses to support our growth, a 8.0 million increase in costs related to marketing events, and a 7.6 million increase in other professional services. 
 As a result of the wind down of the Immersive Healthcare business, we expect to create SG A expense savings of approximately 23.0 million per year moving forward. As we continue to invest in our growth, we have expanded and may continue to expand our sales, marketing, and general and administrative teams through the hiring of additional employees in critical roles that support our strategic initiatives. In addition, we have experienced in the past, and may continue to experience in the future, variability in expenses incurred due to the timing and costs of investments to support the business.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 76.9 million impairment charge which was comprised of 58.9 million in finite lived intangible assets and 18.0 million in property and equipment, respectively, in connection with the impairment of our Immersive Healthcare asset group. See Note 4. Impairment and Restructuring Costs of Immersive Healthcare Asset Group to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. 
 (Benefit from) provision for income taxes Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 (in thousands, except for percentages) (Benefit from) provision for income taxes (3,799) 4,756 (8,555) (179.9) Effective tax rate 16.2 11.5 
 Our benefit from income taxes was 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit attributable to the impairment charge related to our Immersive Healthcare asset group, partially offset by tax expenses attributable to our worldwide profits. Our provision for income taxes was 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to tax expenses attributable to our worldwide profits and a discrete tax charge resulting from the non-deductible IPR D charge associated with an asset acquisition, offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation attributable to our U.S. jurisdiction. 
 Our effective tax rate increased to 16.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 11.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decrease in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation attributable to our U.S. jurisdiction in 2024. 
 Prospectively, our effective tax rate will likely be driven by (1) permanent differences in taxable income for tax and financial reporting purposes, (2) tax expense or benefit attributable to our worldwide financial results, and (3) discrete tax adjustments such as excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to stock-based compensation. Our income tax provision can be volatile as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies can fluctuate from period to period due to the price of our stock, the volume of share-based grants exercised or vested, and the fair value assigned to equity awards under U.S. GAAP. In addition, changes in tax law or our interpretation thereof, and changes to our valuation allowance could result in fluctuations in our effective tax rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 738.6 million in working capital, which included 280.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and 10.5 million in marketable investments. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 8.8 of our cash and cash equivalents in foreign entities. 
 We believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our principal liquidity requirements are to fund our operations, expand manufacturing operations which includes, but is not limited to, maintaining sufficient levels of inventory to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, fund research and development activities and fund our capital expenditures. We may also lease or purchase additional facilities to facilitate our growth. We expect to continue to make investments as we launch new products, expand our manufacturing operations and information technology infrastructures and further expand into international markets. We may, however, require or elect to secure additional financing as we continue to execute our business strategy. If we require or elect to raise additional funds, we may do so through equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, could result in dilution to our stockholders, and could require us to agree to covenants that limit our operating flexibility. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On August 5, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization in the amount of up to 200.0 million, allowing the Company to repurchase its common stock from time to time at such prices as it deems appropriate through open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase transactions, or otherwise. The repurchase authorization expires on July 31, 2025. Under this authorization, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement ASR with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association to repurchase 100.0 million of the Company s common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 517,763 shares under the ASR at an aggregate cost of 100.4 million, including legal and financial advisor fees of 0.4 million associated with the repurchase. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had remaining authority to purchase 100.0 million of its common stock under the share repurchase authorization. See Note 11. Share Repurchase Program to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents, net cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities and our ending balance of cash and cash equivalents: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 167,486 69,858 Net cash provided by operating activities 117,373 61,072 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 88,579 (40,356) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (93,074) 10,282 Cash and cash equivalents and at end of period 280,476 100,757 
 Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items (including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, acquired in-process research and development, impairment charge, inventory write-offs and write-downs, changes in deferred tax balances, and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities). 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 117.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted of consolidated net loss of 19.7 million and non-cash items of 151.7 million, offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 14.7 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities primarily relates to an increase in inventories of 46.0 million to support our growth and an increase in accounts payable of 6.0 million, due to timing of payments. This was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of 23.4 million due to timing of invoicing and collections, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current and non-current assets of 1.7 million, and a decrease in accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities of 0.2 million due to timing of payments. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 61.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted of consolidated net income of 36.7 million and non-cash items of 86.0 million, offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 61.7 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities primarily relates to an increase in inventories of 46.5 million to support our growth, an increase in accounts receivable of 6.6 million due to timing of invoicing and collections, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current and non-current assets of 10.3 million. This was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of 2.1 million due to timing of payments. 
 Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities relates primarily to purchases of marketable and non-marketable investments, capital expenditures and payments in connection with asset acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable investments. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 88.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily consisted of 112.8 million in proceeds from maturities of marketable investments, net of purchases, partially offset by purchases of capital expenditures of 15.8 million and non-marketable investments of 10.0 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 40.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and primarily consisted of 27.3 million in purchases of marketable investments, net of proceeds from maturities, capital expenditures of 11.6 million and 1.0 million in payments in connection with an asset acquisition. 
 Net Cash (Used In) Provided By Financing Activities 
 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities primarily relates to repurchases of our common stock and payments towards the reduction of our finance lease obligations, partially offset by proceeds from exercises of stock options and issuances of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.

Table of Contents 

Net cash used in financing activities was 93.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily consisted of repurchases of common stock of 100.4 million, including legal and financial advisor fees, and 1.7 million in payments towards finance leases, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of 8.9 million. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 10.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and primarily consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of 8.4 million and proceeds from exercises of stock options of 4.7 million, partially offset by 1.5 million in payments towards finance leases and 1.1 million of payments of employee taxes related to vested restricted stock units. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 There have been no other material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2024 from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We have prepared our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as revenue and expenses recorded during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 For information with respect to recently issued accounting standards and the impact of these standards on our consolidated financial statements, refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 We are exposed to various market risks, which may result in potential losses arising from adverse changes in market rates, such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not believe we are exposed to material market risk with respect to our cash and cash equivalents and/or our marketable investments. 
 Interest Rate Risk. We had cash and cash equivalents of 280.5 million as of September 30, 2024, which consisted of funds held in money market funds, U.S. treasury securities, and general checking and savings accounts. In addition, we had marketable investments of 10.5 million, which consisted primarily of U.S. treasury securities and commercial paper. Our investment policy is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity needs. Under the policy, we invest in highly rated securities, while limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer other than the U.S. government. We do not invest in financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments. We utilize external investment managers who adhere to the guidelines of our investment policy. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of our cash and cash equivalents or marketable investments. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk Management. We operate in countries other than the United States, and, therefore, we are exposed to foreign currency risks. We bill most sales outside of the United States in local currencies, primarily in euros, with some sales being denominated in other currencies. When sales or expenses are not denominated in U.S. dollars, a fluctuation in exchange rates could affect our net income. We do not believe our net income would be materially impacted by an immediate 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates. We do not currently hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; however, we may choose to hedge our exposure in the future. 
 While our gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily impacted by product mix, regional mix, and production initiatives to support demand and create future efficiencies, changes in prices did not have a significant impact on our results of operations for any periods presented on our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation as of September 30, 2024 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, which are defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met.
