 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024. Currently, the key factor on the Company s assumption of providing valuation allowance was purely based on our 3-year cumulative operating losses. Once we begin generating profits, we will re-evaluate whether providing valuation allowance is appropriate or if we can reassess that allowance.

 of and of available-for-sale securities had unrealized losses with an aggregate decline of ) and ) from the amortized cost of those securities, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024, allowance for credit losses has been recognized on available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position as the Company does not believe any of the debt securities are credit impaired. This is based on the Company s analysis of the risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors related to available-for-sale debt securities. The issuers of these debt securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. The Company does not intend to sell these debt securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost, which may be at maturity. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the debt securities were purchased. 
 With regard to U.S. mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds issued by the U.S. government, or agencies thereof, it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the amortized cost basis of the securities as such securities are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Accordingly, allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. 
 With regard to corporate bonds, management considers (i) issuer bond ratings, (ii) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (iii) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities, and (iv) internal forecasts. Securities under the U.S. Small Business Administration SBA government guaranteed loan pools program were purchased at a premium and the impairment was attributable primarily to increased prepayment speeds. The timely payment of principal and interest on these securities is guaranteed by the U.S. Government agency. The contractual terms of the subordinated notes do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost bases of the investments. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2024, there were no past due principal or interest payments associated with these securities. Based upon (i) the issuer s strong bond ratings and (ii) a zero historical loss rate, allowance for credit losses has been recorded for available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2024. All debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 continue to perform as scheduled and the Company does not believe there is a possible credit loss or that an allowance for credit loss on these debt securities is necessary. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, available-for-sale securities of million and million, respectively, were pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") and Federal Reserve Bank FRB ). The securities were pledged primarily to secure borrowings from the FHLB and FRB.

 of the market value of the underlying collateral. Patriot s loan origination policy for multi-family residential real estate is limited to of the market value of the underlying collateral. In the case of construction loans, the maximum loan-to-value is of the as completed appraised value of the real estate project. Management monitors the appraised value of collateral on an on-going basis and additional collateral is requested when warranted. Real estate is the primary form of collateral, although other forms of collateral do exist and may include such assets as accounts receivable, inventory, marketable securities, time deposits, and other business assets. 
 
 purchase any commercial real estate loans. 
 Residential Real Estate Loans 
 Patriot s residential real estate loan portfolio consists primarily of purchased residential loans. The repayment of residential real estate loans, as well as the loans secured by residential real estate, may be negatively impacted if borrowers experience financial difficulties, if there is a significant decline in the value of the property securing the loan, or if there are declines in general economic conditions. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Patriot purchased and residential real estate loans, respectively. During the three and nine months ended 2023, Patriot did purchase any residential real estate loans. 
 In 2024, the Bank reentered the residential mortgage business, began originating mortgage loans through its mortgage origination unit, Residential Mortgage Division, based in Jacksonville, Florida. These mortgage loans are typically sold to third parties. For further details, refer to Loans Held for Sale disclosures in footnote 5. 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans 
 Patriot s commercial and industrial loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial business loans and lines of credit to businesses and professionals. These loans are generally for the financing of accounts receivable, purchases of inventory, purchases of new or used equipment, or for other short- or long-term working capital purposes. These loans are generally secured by business assets but are also occasionally offered on an unsecured basis. In granting these types of loans, Patriot considers the borrower s cash flow as the primary source of repayment, supported by the value of collateral, if any, and personal guarantees, as applicable. Repayment of commercial and industrial loans may be negatively impacted by adverse changes in economic conditions, ineffective management, claims on the borrower s assets by others that are superior to Patriot s claims, a loss of demand for the borrower s products or services, or the death or disability of the borrower or other key management personnel.

 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The syndicated and leveraged loan is included in the commercial and industrial loan classification and is comprised of loan transaction led by a major financial institution, which is the Agent Bank or Lead Arranger, and is referred to as a syndicated loan or "Shared National Credit (SNC)". The SNC loan was determined to be complementary to the Bank s existing commercial and industrial loan portfolio and product offerings. Further originations in this loan class are not expected. 
 Consumer and Other Loans 
 Patriot offers individual consumers various forms of credit including installment loans, credit cards, overdraft protection, auto loans and reserve lines of credit. Repayments of such loans are generally dependent on the personal income of the borrower, which may be negatively impacted by adverse changes in economic conditions. The Company does not place a high emphasis on originating these types of loans. 
 The Company has purchased unsecured consumer loans from a third party which are higher yielding loans of - year terms that are expected to incur an increased level of charge-offs. Loans outstanding under this program at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled million and million, respectively. loans were purchased under this program for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Bank purchased million and million unsecured consumer loans, respectively. 
 The Company does not originate any lending programs commonly referred to as subprime lending. Subprime lending generally targets borrowers with weakened credit histories that are typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments against the consumer, a history of bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burdened ratios. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Patriot did purchase any home equity line of credit loans HELOC ). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Bank purchased HELOC loans of million and million, respectively. 
 Construction Loans 
 Construction loans are of a short-term nature, generally of or less, that are secured by land and improvements intended for commercial, residential, or mixed-use development. Loan proceeds may be used for the acquisition of or improvements to the land under development and funds are generally disbursed as phases of construction are completed. 
 Included in this category are loans to construct single family homes where no contract of sale exists, based upon the experience and financial strength of the builder, the type and location of the property, and other factors. Construction loans tend to be personally guaranteed by the principal(s). Repayment of such loans may be negatively impacted by an inability to complete construction, a downturn in the market for new construction, by a significant increase in interest rates, or by decline in general economic conditions. The construction loans outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled million and million, respectively. 
 Construction to Permanent - Commercial Real Estate 
 Construction to permanent loans represent a one-time close of a construction facility with simultaneous conversion to an amortizing mortgage loan. Construction to permanent loans combine a short-term period similar to a construction loan, generally with a variable rate, and a longer term commercial real estate loan typically - years, resetting every to the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB rate. 
 Close of the permanent facility typically occurs when events dictate, such as receipt of a certificate of occupancy and property stabilization, which is defined as cash flow sufficient to support a pre-defined minimum debt coverage ratio and other conditions and covenants particular to the loan. Construction facilities are typically variable rate instruments that, upon conversion to an amortizing mortgage loan, reset to a fixed rate instrument that is the greater of the in-force variable rate plus a predetermined spread over a reference rate (e.g., prime) or a minimum interest rate.

 of the principal balance. However, during the pandemic in 2021, the SBA temporarily increased the guarantees to and reverted to on October 1, 2021. The guaranteed portion of the Company s SBA loans is generally sold in the secondary market with the unguaranteed portion held in the portfolio as a loan held for investment. SBA loans are for the purpose of providing working capital, financing the purchase of equipment, inventory, or commercial real estate and for other business purposes. Loans are guaranteed by the businesses' major owners. SBA loans are made based primarily on the historical and projected cash flow of the business and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided. SBA loans held for investment are included in the commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loan classifications, which totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, million SBA loans previously classified as held for sale were transferred to held for investment. held for sale SBA loans were transferred to held for investment during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program 
 Under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act, small business loans were authorized to pay payroll and group health costs, salaries and commissions, mortgage and rent payments, utilities, and interest on other debt. The loans are provided through participating financial institutions that process loan applications and service the loans. The Bank participated in the SBA s Paycheck Protection Program in 2021. Paycheck Protection Program loans totaled and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which are included in the commercial and industrial loan classifications.

 Patriot monitors the credit quality of its loans receivable on an ongoing basis. Credit quality is monitored by reviewing certain indicators, including cash flow from business operations, loan to value ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and credit scores. 
 Patriot employs a risk rating system as part of the risk assessment of its loan portfolio. At origination, credit officers are required to assign a risk rating to each loan in their portfolio, which is ratified or modified by the Loan Committee to which the loan is submitted for approval. If financial developments occur on a loan in the credit officer s portfolio of responsibility, the risk rating is reviewed and adjusted, as applicable. In carrying out its oversight responsibilities, the Loan Committee can adjust a risk rating based on available information. In addition, the risk ratings on all commercial loans over 250,000 are reviewed by the Credit Department either annually or biannually, or every 4 years, depending upon the amount of the bank s exposure and other credit metrics. 
 Additionally, Patriot retains an independent third-party loan review firm to perform a semi-annual analysis of the results of its risk rating process. The semi-annual review is based on a randomly selected sample of loans within established parameters (e.g., value, concentration), in order to assess and validate the risk ratings assigned to individual loans. Any changes to the assigned risk ratings, based on the semi-annual review, are required to be reported to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

 The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due for payment unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off when they become days past due days for open ended consumer credit). Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual status or charged-off, at an earlier date, if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. 
 All interest accrued, but not collected for loans that are placed on non-accrual status or charged-off, is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is generally accounted for on the cash-basis method until qualifying for return to accrual status. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, future payments are reasonably assured, after at least six months of timely payment history. The Bank considers loans under 100,000 and consumer installment loans to be pools of smaller homogeneous loan balances, and therefore are collectively evaluated for credit losses, and not individually measured for credit losses.

 Credit losses for loans that no longer share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools are excluded from the collective evaluation and estimated on an individual basis (individually evaluated loans). Individual evaluations are performed for nonaccrual loans in excess of as well as selected substandard loans. Specific allowances were estimated based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows. 
 For collateral dependent loans, appraisal reports of the underlying collateral have been obtained from independent licensed appraisal firms. For non-performing loans, the independently determined appraised values were first reduced by a discount to reflect the Bank s experience selling Other Real Estate Owned ("OREO") properties, and were further reduced by in selling costs, in order to estimate the potential loss, if any, that may eventually be realized. Performing loans are monitored to determine when, if at all, additional credit loss reserves may be required for a loss of underlying collateral value. For cash flow dependent loans, the Bank determined the reserve based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. 
 Loans not requiring specific reserves had fair values exceeding the total recorded investment, supporting the net investment in the loan which includes principal balance, unamortized fees and costs and accrued interest, if any. Once a borrower is in default, Patriot is under no obligation to advance additional funds on unused commitments.

 The Company generally sells the guaranteed portion of its SBA loans to a third party and retains the servicing, holding the unguaranteed portion in its portfolio. When sales of SBA loans do occur, the premium received on the sale and the present value of future cash flows of the servicing assets, less the discount of the retained portion of the loan are recognized in income. 
 Servicing assets represent the estimated fair value of retained servicing rights, net of servicing costs, at the time loans are sold. Servicing assets are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues. Impairment will be evaluated based on stratifying the underlying financial assets by date of origination and term. Fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics, when available, or based upon discounted cash flows using market-based assumptions. Any impairment, if temporary, would be reported as a valuation allowance. 
 Serviced loans sold to others are not included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total amount of such loans serviced, but owned by a third party, amounted to approximately million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Since these commitments could expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extending credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies, but may include commercial property, residential property, deposits and securities. Patriot has established an allowance for credit loss of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. 
 Standby letters of credit are written commitments issued by Patriot to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Guarantees that are not derivative contracts are recorded at fair value and included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank has an irrevocable stand-by letter of credit for a maximum of million, issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston on behalf of the Bank, with Mastercard as the beneficiary, which expires on April 30, 2025.

 par value. The stocks are non-marketable equity securities, and as such, are considered restricted securities that are carried at cost. 
 Loans 
 The fair value of loan portfolio is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. We estimate the fair value of our loan portfolio using an exit price notion resulting in prior periods no longer being comparable. The exit price notion requires determination of the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions depending on facts and circumstances, such as origination rates, credit risk, transaction costs, liquidity, national and regional market trends and other adjustments, utilizing publicly available rates and indices. The application of an exit price notion requires the use of significant judgment. 
 Loans Held for Sale 
 The fair value of loans held for sale is estimated by using a market approach that includes prices for loans sold awaiting settlement and other observable inputs. The Company has determined that the inputs used to value the loans held for sale fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 SBA Servicing Asset 
 Servicing assets do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. The Company estimates the fair value of servicing assets using discounted cash flow models incorporating numerous assumptions from the perspective of a market participant including market discount rates and prepayment speeds. Due to the significant unobservable input related to the servicing rights, the SBA servicing asset is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 Other Real Estate Owned 
 The fair value of OREO the Bank may obtain is based on current appraised property value less estimated costs to sell. When fair value is based on unadjusted current appraised value, OREO is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Patriot classifies OREO within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when unobservable inputs are used to determine adjustments to appraised values. Patriot does not record OREO at fair value on a recurring basis, but rather initially records OREO at fair value on a non-recurring basis and then monitors property and market conditions that may indicate a change in value is warranted. 
 Derivative asset (liability) - Interest Rate Swaps 
 The Company s derivative assets and liabilities consist of transactions as part of management s strategy to manage interest rate risk. The valuation of interest rate swap agreements does not contain any counterparty risk. The valuation of the Company s interest rate swaps is obtained from a third-party pricing service and is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The pricing analysis is based on observable inputs for the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity and interest rate curves. The Company has determined that the inputs used to value its interest rate derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 8 for additional disclosures on derivatives.

 Patriot measures certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis. When circumstances dictate (e.g., impairment of long-lived assets, other than temporary impairment of collateral value), the carrying values of such financial assets and financial liabilities are adjusted to fair value or fair value less costs to sell, as may be appropriate. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, corporate bonds were classified as Level 3 instruments. The fair values of these securities were determined using a present value approach. The discount rate assumed was determined based on unobservable inputs in a pricing model.

 Patriot discloses fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. Certain financial instruments are excluded from disclosure requirements and, accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not necessarily represent the complete underlying value of financial instruments included in the consolidated financial statements. 
 The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these consolidated financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of the financial instruments measured may be different than if they had been subsequently valued. 
 The information presented should not be interpreted as an estimate of the total fair value of Patriot s assets and liabilities, since only a portion of Patriot s assets and liabilities are required to be measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. Due to the wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between Patriot s fair value disclosures and those of other bank holding companies may not be meaningful.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and to disclose contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management has identified the accounting for the allowance for credit losses, the analysis and valuation of its investment securities, the valuation of deferred tax assets, the valuation of derivatives, and the valuation of servicing assets as certain of the Company s most critical accounting policies and estimates in that they are important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results of operations. They require management s most subjective and complex judgment as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Refer to the 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. 

Summary 
 The Company reported net loss of 27.0 million 6.78 basic and diluted loss per share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 3.8 million 0.95 basic and diluted loss per share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The 23.2 million increase in net loss for the quarter was primarily driven by a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets ("DTA") of 25.1 million, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more information. This increase was partially offset by a pretax 3.7 million reduction in provision for credit losses and a pretax 1.5 million decrease in net interest income. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net loss was 30.3 million, or 7.63 basic and diluted loss per share, compared to a net loss of 5.1 million, 1.28 basic and diluted loss per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This represents a year-over-year increase in net loss of 25.3 million. The primary driver of this increase was the same 25.1 million DTA valuation allowance, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more information. This increase is offset by fluctuations including lower pretax net interest income of 6.8 million, lower pretax provision for credit losses of 3.5 million and higher pretax noninterest income of 3.6 million, primarily from revenue on the Digital Payments Division. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Total assets decreased 119.3 million to 974.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1.09 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to the decline in loans receivable of 93.2 million as of September 30, 2024.

 Allowance for Credit Losses ("ACL") on Loans 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans was 15.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 15.9 million as of December 31, 2023, a reduction of 941,000. The decrease in allowance was mainly due to reduction in loan balances and the recognition of charge-offs on the unsecured consumer loan portfolio. Based upon the overall assessment and evaluation of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024, management believes 15.0 million in the allowance for credit losses, which represented 1.98 of gross loans outstanding, is adequate under prevailing economic conditions to absorb existing losses in the loan portfolio. 
 The following table provides detail of activity in the allowance for credit losses on loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs decreased 2.1 million to 1.1 million, with a net charge-offs to average loans ratio of 0.56 , compared to 3.2 million and 1.40 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs declined 1.4 million to 5.8 million, with a net charge-offs to average loans ratio of 0.96 , down from 7.2 million and 1.07 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The reduction in net charge-offs for both three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primary driven by a 1.7 million decrease in charge-offs related to purchased unsecured consumer loans as the portfolio balances have declined.

 The average loan balance decreased by 137.4 million, from 921.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 783.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine-month period, the average loan balance decreased 89.4 million, from 899.5 million in 2023 to 810.1 million in 2024. This decrease in average loan balance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflects the Company's continued approach of limiting loan growth and allowing loans to pay down to strengthen capital ratios as the balance sheet is reduced. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the ACL was 15.0 million and 25.7 million, respectively. The decrease was due to significant charge-offs of reserved CRE and consumer loans after September 30, 2023, which also impacted the ACL to loans ratio of 1.98 , compared to an ACL of 25.7 million and an ACL to loans ratio of 2.88 as of September 30, 2023. 
 The nonaccrual loan was 36.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 30.8 million as of September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans ratio was 41.01 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 83.26 as of September 30, 2023. The rate at September 30, 2023 was significantly higher due to reserves on individually evaluated CRE loans that were subsequently charged-off after September 30, 2023.

Deferred Taxes 
 As of September 30, 2024 the carrying value of the deferred tax assets is nil as there is a full valuation allowance against all of the DTAs. As of December 31, 2023, DTAs were 24.1 million, consisting predominately of Federal and state net operating losses, capitalized costs and allowance for credit losses. 
 The effective tax provision rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1067.85 , compared to the effective tax benefit rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of (26.12) . The effective tax provision and benefit rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 363.40 and (26.37) , respectively. The Company s effective rates for both periods were affected by state taxes and non-deductible expenses and the full valuation allowance against all of the DTAs in the third quarter of 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Patriot has 54.7 million of net operating losses ("NOLs") available for Connecticut tax purposes at September 30, 2024, which may be used to offset up to 50 of taxable income in any year. The NOLs expire between 2030 and 2044.

 Valuation Allowance against Deferred Tax Assets 
 Patriot recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets (DTAs) and liabilities (DTLs) are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and loss carry forwards. DTAs and DTLs are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on DTAs and DTLs of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
 In certain circumstances DTAs are subject to reduction by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is subject to ongoing adjustment based on changes in circumstances that affect management s judgment about the realizability of the deferred tax asset. Adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance are charged or credited to the deferred tax component of the income tax provision or benefit. 
 The Company recognize deferred tax assets to the extent we believe it is more likely than not the asset will be realized. Quarterly, management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of existing deferred tax assets, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected taxable income, tax-planning strategies, carryback potential if permitted, and the results of recent operations. A significant piece of objective negative evidence is the existence of a three or four year cumulative loss. Such objective negative evidence limits the ability of management to consider other subjective evidence, such as projected taxable income. When appropriate, the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 
 Based on our assessment performed as of September 30, 2024, we determined that a full valuation allowance was appropriate against the Company s U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. This resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately 25.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Currently, the key factor on the Company s assumption of providing 100 valuation allowance was purely based on our historical operating losses. Once we begin generating profits, we will re-evaluate whether providing 100 valuation allowance is appropriate or if we can reassess that allowance. As deferred tax assets associated with NOL carryforwards are already a direct reduction to Tier 1 Capital, the valuation allowance at September 30, 2024 resulted in a reduction of Tier 1 Capital of 19.9 million.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures: 
 In addition to evaluating the Company's financial performance in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), management may evaluate certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as uninsured deposits to total deposits excluding Digital Payments deposits. A computation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used for these purposes is contained in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures tables. We believe that by excluding Digital Payments deposits, management can present a view of uninsured deposits that better reflects the Company's traditional deposit base, providing investors with useful information for understanding our uninsured deposits position and financial stability. Digital Payments deposits are analyzed for FDIC insurance at the Program Manager level. Certain accounts are reciprocal deposits through the IntraFi network and therefore the entire deposit balances qualify for FDIC insurance. The remaining deposit balances are aggregated at the Program Manager level, and any deposits exceeding 250,000 are considered uninsured. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and results, and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Borrowings available under the agreements totaled 5.0 million and 22.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The purpose of the agreements is to provide a credit facility intended to satisfy overnight federal account balance requirements and to provide for daily settlement of FRB, Automated Clearing House (ACH), and other clearinghouse transactions. 
 There was no outstanding balance under the agreements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Other Borrowing 
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York FRBNY accepts loan pledges from qualifying depository institutions to secure borrowings from the Discount Window. Patriot has pledged eligible loans as collateral to support its borrowing capacity at the FRBNY. As of September 30, 2024, the book value of the pledged loans totaled 25.5 million, with a collateral value of 19.4 million. No funds were borrowed from the Discount Window under the FRBNY's Borrower-in-Custody ('BIC") program, and no interest expense was incurred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, a total of 12.0 million was borrowed, and interest expense incurred was 43,000 and 48,000, respectively. 
 In July 2023, the Bank established a collateralized funding line of 73.8 million at par value under the Federal Reserve's newly established Bank Term Funding Program ("BTFP"). The program provided additional funding to eligible depository institutions, assuring they can meet the needs of all their depositors.

 Junior subordinated debt owed to unconsolidated trust 
 In 2003, the Patriot National Statutory Trust I the Trust ), which has no independent assets and is wholly-owned by the Company, issued 8.0 million of trust preferred securities. The proceeds, net of a 240,000 placement fee, were invested in junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company, which invested the proceeds in the Bank. The Bank used the proceeds to fund its operations. 
 Trust preferred securities currently qualify for up to 25 of the Company s Tier I Capital, with the excess qualifying as Tier 2 Capital. 
 The junior subordinated debentures are unsecured obligations of the Company. The debentures are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all present and future senior indebtedness of the Company. In addition to its obligations under the junior subordinated debentures and in conjunction with the Trust, the Company issued an unconditional guarantee of the trust preferred securities.

Table of Contents 

 The junior subordinated debentures bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 3.15 and mature on March 26, 2033, at which time the principal amount borrowed will be due. The placement fee of 240,000 is amortized and included as a component of the periodic interest expense on the junior subordinated debentures, in order to produce a constant rate of interest expense. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unamortized placement fee deducted from the face amount of the junior subordinated debt owed to the unconsolidated trust amounted to 104,000 and 111,000, respectively, and accrued interest on the junior subordinated debentures was 9,000 and 12,000, respectively. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized interest expense of 180,000 and 539,000, respectively. Interest expense incurred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 180,000 and 512,000, respectively. 
 At its option, exercisable on a quarterly basis, the Company may redeem the junior subordinated debentures from the Trust, which would then redeem the trust preferred securities. 
 Note Payable 
 In September 2015, the Bank purchased the property in which its Fairfield, Connecticut branch is located for approximately 2.0 million, a property it had been leasing until that date. The purchase price was primarily satisfied by issuing the seller a 2.0 million, nine-year, promissory note bearing interest at a fixed rate of 1.75 per annum. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance on the note was 216,000 and 376,000, respectively. The note is secured by a first Mortgage Deed and Security Agreement on the purchased property. The note originally set to mature in August 2024, was extended from August 25, 2024 to September 1, 2025, with the Bank continuing its scheduled principal and interest payments. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized interest expense of 1,000 and 4,000, respectively. Interest expense incurred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 2,000 and 7,000, respectively. 
 
 Derivatives 
 As of September 30, 2024, Patriot has two interest rate swaps swaps ). One swap is with a loan customer to provide a facility to mitigate the fluctuations in the variable rate on the respective loan. The other swap is with an outside third party. The customer interest rate swap is matched in offsetting terms to the third party interest rate swap. The swaps are reported at fair value in other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Patriot s swaps are derivatives, but are not designated as hedging instruments, thus any net gain or loss resulting from changes in the fair value is recognized in other noninterest income. The Company recognized no gain on the swaps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Further discussion of the fair value of derivatives is set forth in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Equity 
 Equity decreased 28.0 million, from 44.4 million at December 31, 2023 to 16.4 million at September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to a net loss of 30.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by a net unrealized gain in investments of 2.2 million. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Commitments 
 The Company s off-balance sheet commitments primarily consist of commitments to lend of 96.6 million and 92.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank has an irrevocable stand-by letter of credit for a maximum of 45 million, issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston on behalf of the Bank, with Mastercard as the beneficiary, which expires on April 30, 2025.

Results of Operations 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income and dividend income was 12.8 million, which decreased 2.3 million as compared to 15.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Total interest expense was 7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which decreased 730,000 as compared to 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income decreased 1.5 million from 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income and dividend income was 40.0 million, which decreased 4.0 million as compared to 44.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total interest expense was 24.6 million, which increased 2.8 million as compared to 21.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income was 15.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which decreased 6.8 million from 22.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decline for both three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects a lower loan balance and narrower net interest margin due to higher deposit costs and increase in nonaccrual loans. 
 The net interest margin was 2.18 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.48 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net interest margin was 2.18 and 2.90 , respectively. The decline in interest margins for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily associated with an increase in the cost of deposits and other borrowings due to the significant rise in market interest rates and a decline in loan interest income due to the declining loan balance and the increase in nonaccrual loans, partially mitigated by the rise in variable rate interest earning assets.

 Provision for Credit Losses ("PCL") 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses was 1.0 million, consisting of a 1.1 million loan provision and a 58,000 credit for off-balance-sheet exposure reserves. In comparison, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, the provision for credit losses was 4.7 million, including a 4.8 million loan provision and a 112,000 credit for off-balance-sheet exposure reserves. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the PCL was 4.8 million, which included a 4.9 million loan provision and a 94,000 credit for off-balance-sheet exposure reserves. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the provision was 8.2 million, consisting of a 9.6 million provision and a 1.4 million credit for off-balance-sheet exposure reserves. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank has been selectively managing down its credit exposure in certain higher-risk areas. The loan portfolio declined from 889.9 million as of September 30, 2023, to 755.7 million as of September 30, 2024. This reduction in credit exposure has required a lower level of reserves. Consequently, the ACL for loans outstanding decreased from 25.7 million as of September 30, 2023, to 15.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 One key driver in both the level of outstanding loans and reserves is the pool of purchased unsecured consumer loans, which decreased from 58.3 million as of September 30, 2023 to 26.1 million as of September 30, 2024. Correspondingly, the reserves for this pool also fell, declining from 9.2 million as of September 30, 2023 to 3.8 million as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, as of September 30, 2023, the Bank had obligations of 18.1 million yet to fund under these same pools, against which the bank held 1.1 million of reserves. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Bank entered into an agreement with the originator and servicer that released the Bank from any obligation for further funding, thereby freeing up the aforementioned 1.1 million of reserves. 
 As of September 30, 2023, the ACL also included 6.2 million of reserves against an 8.9 million loan that had been originated in part for community development purposes. The loan was used to finance a special-use property and was charged-off during the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting in a loss of approximately 5.9 million. 
 Non-interest income 
 Non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.1 million, compared to 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, non-interest income was 6.4 million and 2.8 million, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to higher non-interest income from the Bank's Digital Payments Division. 
 Non-interest expense 
 Non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 8.4 million, compared to 8.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.6 million, compared to 23.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 The Company reported a provision for income taxes of 24.6 million and 23.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to a benefit for income taxes of 1.3 million and 1.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The provision for income taxes for the third quarter of 2024 included a valuation allowance recorded against all deferred tax assets of 25.1 million, See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

 Liquidity 
 The Company measures liquidity in two primary ratios: on-hand liquidity to total liabilities, and total liquidity to total liabilities. On-hand liquidity is comprised of interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents and unpledged available-for-sale securities. Total liquidity includes on-hand liquidity, plus total available credit lines, plus availability of brokered deposits which is subject to internal limitations. The Company monitors other metrics in addition to on-hand liquidity and total liquidity to manage concentration risk in certain types of liabilities. 
 The Company's on-hand liquidity and total liquidity ratios for the periods ending September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, are as follows: 
 (In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 On-hand liquidity Interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents 70,013 50,322 Available-for-sale securities, at fair value 89,578 89,187 Less: pledged available-for-sale securities (35,627) (68,465) Total on-hand liquidity 123,964 71,044 Borrowing capacity FHLB borrowing capacity 146,301 174,533 FRB borrowing capacity 19,379 81,401 Unsecured credit lines from correspondent banks 5,000 22,000 Brokered deposit capacity 123,733 126,047 Total borrowing capacity 294,413 403,981 Less: used borrowing capacity FHLB capacity used (including the standby letter of credit) (140,860) (173,147) FRB capacity used (70,000) Outstanding brokered deposits (72,077) (40,526) Total used borrowing capacity (212,937) (283,673) Total liquidity 205,440 191,352 Total liabilities 957,697 1,049,042 On-hand liquidity to total liabilities 12.94 6.77 Total liquidity to total liabilities 21.45 18.24 
 On-hand liquidity increased 53 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 due to the payoff of the 70 million Federal Reserve BTFP borrowing, which released the pledge of certain available-for-sale securities. The payoff of the BTFP will have a slight benefit on the Company's Net Interest Income as the rate on the BTFP was slightly higher than the current replacement funding. Both on-hand liquidity to total liabilities and total liquidity to total liabilities increased at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 due to the increased total liquidity and the reduction in total liabilities as the overall balance sheet has shrunk in an effort to improve the Bank's capital ratios. 
 Liquidity is a measure of the Company s ability to generate adequate cash to meet its financial obligations. The principal cash requirements of a financial institution are to cover downward fluctuations in deposit accounts. Management believes the Company s liquid assets provide sufficient coverage to satisfy loan demand, cover potential fluctuations in deposit accounts, and to meet other anticipated operational cash requirements. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 15.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Within this activity there was a significant increase in originations of loans held for sale and proceeds from sale of assets held for sale. This activity is primarily related to the Digital Payments Division credit card loans. This program started in the third quarter of 2023 and continues today. The activity generates non-interest income and only requires short term liquidity as the loans are originated and expected to be sold within three days.

Table of Contents 

 Net cash provided by investing activities increased by 149 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to lower originations of loans receivable and purchases of loans receivable as the Company is focused on lowering total assets to improve the Company's capital ratios. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by 199 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to activity in proceeds from FRB and correspondent bank borrowings and repayments of FRB and correspondent bank borrowings. The Company did not require as much funding from FRB and correspondent bank borrowings due to the net cash provided by lower loan originations and loan purchases. 
 Management manages its capital resources by seeking to maintain a capital structure that will ensure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and absorb potential losses while effectively leveraging capital to enhance profitability and return to shareholders. Dividends have not been paid to shareholders since 2020 but may resume in future periods. 
 The primary source of liquidity at the Company is returns of capital from the Bank. These capital returns are subject to OCC approval and are needed periodically to provide funds needed to service debt payments at the Company. 

Capital 
 The following tables illustrate the Company s and the Bank s regulatory capital ratios at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 : 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. Patriot Bank, N.A. Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. Patriot Bank, N.A. (Dollar amounts in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Total Capital (to risk weighted assets) 61,681 7.82 73,206 9.29 89,727 10.00 100,683 11.22 Tier 1 Capital (to risk weighted assets) 43,018 5.45 64,543 8.19 73,282 8.17 94,238 10.50 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (to risk weighted assets) 35,018 4.44 64,543 8.19 65,282 7.27 94,238 10.50 Tier 1 Leverage Capital (to average assets) 43,018 4.35 64,543 6.53 73,282 6.76 94,238 8.70 
 Capital adequacy is one of the most important factors used to determine the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system. From September 2021 to September 30, 2023, the Company elected to adopt the CBLR framework. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company elected to use the instituted regulatory risk-based capital approach. 
 Under the regulatory framework for prompt correction action, to be considered well capitalized, an institution must generally have a leverage capital ratio of at least 5.0 , CET1 capital ratio at least 6.5 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10 . However, the OCC has the discretion to require increased capital ratios. Management continuously assesses the adequacy of the Bank s capital with the goal to maintain a well capitalized classification. 
 On April 17, 2024, based on its supervisory profile, the Bank was notified by the OCC that it established individual minimum capital ratios ("IMCR") for the Bank. Specifically, the Bank is required to maintain the following ratios: a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 10.00 , a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.00 , a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.00 and a total capital ratio of 11.50 .

 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank did not meet all of its regulatory capital requirements. The common equity tier 1 capital was 64.5 million, or 8.19 of risk-weighted assets, below the required level of 10.00 . The Tier 1 capital was 64.5 million, or 8.19 of risk-weighted assets, also below the required level of 10.00 . However, the Tier 1 leverage capital was 64.5 million, or 6.53 of average assets, falling short of the required 9.00 . The total risk-based capital was 73.2 million, or 9.29 of risk-weighted assets, below the required 11.50 . During the second quarter, the Bank significantly reduced its total and risk-based assets to work towards achieving the IMCR targets. This trend will continue through the remainder of 2024 with a goal of achieving the IMCR in 2025. The Company has restricted new loan originations significantly to allow the loan portfolio to decline in order to lower average assets and risk weighted assets. Average assets are down 100 million to 984 million at September 30, 2024 from 1,083 million at December 31, 2023, reflecting the actions of the Company during the year to lower assets. 
 
 If a bank fails to maintain its capital ratios above the higher minimums established in the IMCR, the OCC may issue a capital directive requiring the bank to submit and adhere to an acceptable plan to achieve or maintain its required capital levels. Additionally, the OCC may deem a bank s failure to maintain capital ratios above the IMCR an unsafe or unsound practice within the meaning of 12 USC 1818. 1 

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 The Company s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. Notwithstanding this, inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral, in particular, real estate. Inflation, deflation or disinflation could significantly affect the Company s earnings in future periods. 

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk is defined as the sensitivity of income to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and other market-driven rates or prices. The Company s market risk is primarily limited to interest rate risk. 
 The Company s goal is to maximize long term profitability while minimizing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The first priority is to structure and price the Company s assets and liabilities to maintain an acceptable interest rate spread while reducing the net effect of changes in interest rates. In order to accomplish this, the focus is on maintaining a proper balance between the timing and volume of assets and liabilities re-pricing within the balance sheet. One method of achieving this balance is to originate variable rate loans for the portfolio and purchase short-term investments to offset the increasing short-term re-pricing of the liability side of the balance sheet. In fact, a number of the interest-bearing deposit products have no contractual maturity. Therefore, deposit balances may run off unexpectedly due to changing market conditions. Additionally, loans and investments with longer term rate adjustment frequencies can be matched against longer term deposits and borrowings to lock in a desirable spread. 
 The exposure to interest rate risk is monitored by the Management Asset and Liability Committee consisting of senior management personnel. The Committee reviews the interrelationships within the balance sheet to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk. This Committee reports to the Board of Directors. In addition to the Management Asset and Liability Committee, there is a Board Asset and Liability Committee ALCO ), which meets quarterly. ALCO monitors the interest rate risk analyses, reviews investment transactions during the period and determines compliance with the Company s Investment, ALCO and Liquidity policies. 
 Management analyzes the Company s interest rate sensitivity position to manage the risk associated with interest rate movements through the use of interest income simulation and gap analysis. The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest sensitive. An asset or liability is said to be interest sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period.

Table of Contents 

 Management s goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income. Interest income simulations are completed quarterly and presented to ALCO. The simulations provide an estimate of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under a range of assumptions. Changes to these assumptions can significantly affect the results of the simulations. The simulation incorporates assumptions regarding the potential timing in the repricing of certain assets and liabilities when market rates change and the changes in spreads between different market rates. 
 Simulation analysis is only an estimate of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time. Management regularly reviews the potential effect changes in interest rates could have on the repayment of rate-sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate-sensitive liabilities. 
 The tables below set forth examples of changes in estimated net interest income and the estimated net portfolio value based on projected scenarios of interest rate increases and decreases. The analyses indicate the rate risk embedded in the Company s portfolio at the dates indicated should all interest rates instantaneously rise or fall. The results of these changes are added to or subtracted from the base case; however, there are certain limitations to these types of analyses. Rate changes are rarely instantaneous and these analyses may therefore overstate the impact of short-term repricings. In certain low interest rate environments, the calculated effects of the 100 and 200 basis point downward shocks cannot absolutely reflect the risk to earnings and equity, since the interest rates on certain balance sheet items have approached their minimums. Therefore, it is not possible for the analyses to fully measure the true impact of these downward shocks.

 Item 4: Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Patriot maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information that is required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. 
 Patriot s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, Patriot s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, Patriot s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e), were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. In addition, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and/or procedures may deteriorate.
