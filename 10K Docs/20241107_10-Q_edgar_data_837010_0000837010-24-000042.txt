 NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including "Risk Factors" and "Management s Narrative Analysis of the Results of Operations and Financial Condition" contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements relating to future developments in our business or expectations for our future financial performance and any statement not involving a historical fact. Forward-looking statements use words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "plan," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. Actual results, performance or events may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement due to, among other things, (i) global market risks, including general economic conditions, our ability to manage such risks and interest rates; (ii) liquidity and credit risks, including financial strength or credit ratings downgrades, requirements to post collateral, and availability of funds through lending programs; (iii) strategic and business risks, including our ability to maintain market share or otherwise manage our third party relationships; (iv) investment risks, including the ability to achieve desired returns or liquidate certain assets; (v) operational risks, including cybersecurity and privacy failures and our dependence on third parties; and (vi) tax, regulatory and legal risks, including limits on our ability to use deferred tax assets, changes in law, regulation or accounting standards, and our ability to comply with regulations. Factors that may cause actual results to differ from those in any forward-looking statement also include those described under "Risk Factors" and "Management s Narrative Analysis of the Results of Operations and Financial Condition" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 The risks included here are not exhaustive. Current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.

 Repurchase Agreements and Securities Pledged 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did have any securities pledged in dollar rolls or reverse repurchase agreements. 
 
 The Company engages in securities lending whereby the initial collateral is required at a rate of at least of the market value of the loaned securities. The lending agent retains the collateral and invests it in high quality liquid assets on behalf of the Company. The market value of the loaned securities is monitored on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained or refunded as the market value of the loaned securities fluctuates. The lending agent indemnifies the Company against losses resulting from the failure of a counterparty to return securities pledged where collateral is insufficient to cover the loss. 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Company receives cash collateral and non-cash collateral in the form of securities. If cash is received as collateral, the lending agent retains the cash collateral and invests it in short-term liquid assets on behalf of the Company. Securities retained as collateral by the lending agent may not be sold or re-pledged, except in the event of default, and are not reflected on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. This collateral generally consists of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency securities and MBS pools. 
 
 The following table presents Securities pledged as of the dates indicated:

 As of September 30, 2024, the average duration of our fixed maturities portfolio, including securities pledged, is between and years. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that an allowance for credit losses was not warranted for the securities above because the unrealized losses are interest rate related. The Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases. 
 
 Evaluating Securities for Impairments 
 The Company performs a regular evaluation, on a security-by-security basis, of its available-for-sale securities holdings, including fixed maturity securities, in accordance with its impairment policy in order to evaluate whether such investments are impaired. 
 
 Intent impairments were and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Company may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed maturities. In certain situations, new factors, including changes in the business environment, can change the Company s previous intent to continue holding a security. Accordingly, these factors may lead the Company to record additional intent related capital losses. 
 
 Debt Modifications 
 
 The Company evaluates all debt modifications to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. Disclosures are required for loan modifications with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had material debt modifications that require such disclosure.

 Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 
 
 The Company diversifies its commercial mortgage loan portfolio by geographic region and property type to reduce concentration risk. The Company manages risk when originating commercial mortgage loans by generally lending only up to of the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate. Subsequently, the Company continuously evaluates mortgage loans based on relevant current information including a review of loan-specific performance, property characteristics and market trends. Loan performance is monitored on a loan specific basis through the review of submitted appraisals, operating statements, rent revenues and annual inspection reports, among other items. This review ensures properties are performing at a consistent and acceptable level to secure the debt. The components to evaluate debt service coverage are received and reviewed at least annually to determine the level of risk. 
 
 Loan-to-value ("LTV") and debt service coverage ("DSC") ratios are measures commonly used to assess the risk and quality of mortgage loans. These ratios are utilized as part of the review process described above.

 Valuation of Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value 
 
 Certain assets and liabilities are measured at estimated fair value on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The exit price and the transaction (or entry) price will be the same at initial recognition in many circumstances. However, in certain cases, the transaction price may not represent fair value. The fair value of a liability is based on the amount that would be paid to transfer a liability to a third-party with an equal credit standing. Fair value is required to be a market-based measurement that is determined based on a hypothetical transaction at the measurement date, from a market participant's perspective. The Company considers three broad valuation approaches when a quoted price is unavailable: (i) the market approach, (ii) the income approach and (iii) the cost approach. The Company determines the most appropriate valuation technique to use, given the instrument being measured and the availability of sufficient inputs. The Company prioritizes the

Significant Unobservable Inputs 
 
 The Company's Level 3 fair value measurements of its fixed maturities, equity securities and equity and credit derivative contracts are primarily based on broker quotes for which the quantitative detail of the unobservable inputs is neither provided nor reasonably corroborated, thus negating the ability to perform a sensitivity analysis. The Company performs a review of broker quotes by performing a monthly price variance comparison and back tests broker quotes to recent trade prices.

 Litigation, Regulatory Matters and Contingencies 
 
 Litigation, regulatory and other loss contingencies arise in connection with the Company's activities as a diversified financial services firm. The Company is a defendant in a number of litigation matters arising from the conduct of its business, both in the ordinary course and otherwise. In some of these matters, claimants seek to recover very large or indeterminate amounts, including compensatory, punitive, treble and exemplary damages. Modern pleading practice in the U.S. permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary damages and other relief. Claimants are not always required to specify the monetary damages they seek or they may be required only to state an amount sufficient to meet a court's jurisdictional requirements. Moreover, some jurisdictions allow claimants to allege monetary damages that far exceed any reasonably possible verdict. The variability in pleading requirements and past experience demonstrates that the monetary and other relief that may be requested in a lawsuit or claim often bears little relevance to the merits or potential value of a claim. Litigation against the Company includes a variety of claims including negligence, breach of contract, fraud, violation of regulation or statute, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, failure to supervise, elder abuse and other torts. 
 
 As with other financial services companies, the Company periodically receives informal and formal requests for information from various state and federal governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in connection with inquiries and investigations of the products and practices of the Company or the financial services industry. 
 
 The outcome of a litigation or regulatory matter is difficult to predict and the amount or range of potential losses associated with these or other loss contingencies requires significant management judgment. It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome or to provide reasonably possible losses or ranges of losses for all pending regulatory matters, litigation and other loss contingencies.

accrual is required, the Company develops an estimate of the unaccrued amounts of the reasonably possible range of losses. As of September 30, 2024, the Company estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of any amounts accrued for these matters as of such date, as not material to the Company. 
 
 For other matters, the Company is currently not able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The Company is often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from plaintiffs and other parties, investigation of factual allegations, rulings by a court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts and the progress of settlement discussions. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to litigation and regulatory contingencies and updates the Company's accruals, disclosures and reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews. 
 
 Litigation includes Ravarino, et al. v. Voya Financial, Inc., et al. (USDC District of Connecticut, No. 3:21-cv-01658)(filed December 14, 2021). In this putative class action, the plaintiffs allege that the named defendants, which include the Company, breached their fiduciary duties of prudence and loyalty in the administration of the Voya 401(k) Savings Plan. The plaintiffs claim that the named defendants did not exercise proper prudence in their management of allegedly poorly performing investment options, including proprietary funds, and passed excessive investment-management and other administrative fees for proprietary and non-proprietary funds onto plan participants. The plaintiffs also allege that the defendants engaged in self-dealing through the inclusion of the Voya Stable Value Option into the plan offerings and by setting the crediting rate for participants investment in the Stable Value Fund artificially low in relation to Voya s general account investment returns in order to maximize the spread and Voya s profits at the participants expense. The complaint seeks disgorgement of unjust profits as well as costs incurred. On June 13, 2023, the Court issued a ruling granting in part and denying in part Voya's motion to dismiss. The court largely dismissed the claims for breach of fiduciary duty. The remaining claims concern allegations of breaches of the ERISA prohibited transactions rule and a claim for failure to monitor the Voya Small Cap Growth fund. The Company denies the allegations, which it believes are without merit, and intends to defend the case vigorously.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity refers to our ability to access sufficient sources of cash to meet the requirements of our operating, investing and financing activities. Capital refers to our long-term financial resources available to support business operations and future growth. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of the businesses, timing of cash flows on investments and products, general economic conditions and access to the capital markets and the other sources of liquidity and capital described herein. 
 
 The following discussion presents a review of our sources and uses of liquidity and capital and should be read in its entirety and in conjunction with the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements discussion further below. 
 
 Liquidity Management 
 
 Our principal available sources of liquidity are product charges, investment income, proceeds from maturity and sale of investments, proceeds from debt issuance and borrowing facilities, repurchase agreements, contract deposits, securities lending and capital contributions. Primary uses of these funds are payments of commissions and operating expenses, interest credits, investment purchases and contract maturities, withdrawals and surrenders and payment of dividends. 
 
 Our liquidity position is managed by maintaining adequate levels of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. As part of the liquidity management process, different scenarios are modeled to determine whether existing assets are adequate to meet projected cash flows. Key variables in the modeling process include interest rates, equity market movements, quantity and type of interest and equity market hedges, anticipated contract owner behavior, market value of the general account assets, variable separate account performance and implications of rating agency actions. 
 
 The fixed account liabilities are supported by a general account portfolio, principally composed of fixed rate investments with matching duration characteristics that can generate predictable, steady rates of return. The portfolio management strategy for the fixed account considers the assets available-for-sale. This strategy enables us to respond to changes in market interest rates, prepayment risk, relative values of asset sectors and individual securities and loans, credit quality outlook and other relevant factors. The objective of portfolio management is to maximize returns, taking into account interest rate and credit risk, as well as other risks. Our asset/liability management discipline includes strategies to minimize exposure to loss as interest rates and economic and market conditions change. In executing this strategy, we use derivative instruments to manage these risks. Our derivative counterparties are of high credit quality.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Additional sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities to meet short-term cash requirements that arise in the ordinary course of business. For information regarding our reciprocal loan agreement with Voya Financial, see the Financing Agreements Note in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 We hold approximately 47.8 of our assets in marketable securities. These assets include cash, U.S. Treasuries, Agencies, Corporate Bonds, ABS, CMBS and collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMO") and Equity securities. In the event of a temporary liquidity need, cash may be raised by entering into repurchase agreements, dollar rolls and/or security lending agreements by temporarily lending securities and receiving cash collateral. Under our Liquidity Plan, up to 12 of our general account statutory admitted assets may be allocated to repurchase, securities lending and dollar roll programs. At the time a temporary cash need arises, the actual percentage of admitted assets available for repurchase transactions will depend upon outstanding allocations to the three programs. As of September 30, 2024, VRIAC had securities lending collateral assets of 727 million, which represents approximately 0.6 of its general account statutory admitted assets. As of December 31, 2023, VRIAC had securities lending collateral assets of 499 million, which represents approximately 0.4 of its general account statutory admitted assets. 
 
 Management believes that our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our short-term cash obligations. 
 
 Capital Contributions and Dividends 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, VRIAC did not receive any capital contribution from its Parent. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, VRIAC paid ordinary dividends to its Parent of 473 million and 310 million, respectively. 
 
 Ratings 
 
 Our access to funding and our related cost of borrowing, collateral requirements for derivative instruments and the attractiveness of certain of our products to customers are affected by our credit ratings and insurance financial strength ratings, which are periodically reviewed by the rating agencies. Financial strength ratings and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products. Credit ratings are also important to our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and for the cost of such financing. 
 
 A downgrade in our credit ratings or the credit or financial strength ratings of our Parent or rated affiliates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See A downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings may result in a loss of business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K . 
 
 Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity's ability to repay its indebtedness. These ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of our securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization. 
 
 Rating agencies use an "outlook" statement for both industry sectors and individual companies. For an industry sector, a stable outlook generally implies that over the next 12 to 18 months the rating agency expects ratings to remain unchanged among companies in the sector. For a particular company, an outlook generally indicates a medium or long-term trend in credit fundamentals, which if continued, may lead to a rating change.

 (1) Fitch's financial strength rating for insurance companies range from "AAA (exceptionally strong)" to "C (distressed). " Long-term credit ratings range from "AAA (highest credit quality)," which denotes exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, to "D (default)." 
 (2) Moody s financial strength ratings for insurance companies range from "Aaa (exceptional)" to "C (lowest)." Numeric modifiers are used to refer to the ranking within the group- with 1 being the highest and 3 being the lowest. These modifiers are used to indicate relative strength within a category. Long-term credit ratings range from "Aaa (highest)" to "C (default)." 
 (3) S P's financial strength ratings for insurance companies range from "AAA (extremely strong)" to "D (default)." Long-term credit ratings range from "AAA (extremely strong)" to "D (default)." 
 
 On September 18, 2024, Fitch upgraded Voya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company's Financial Strength to A+ from A. In conjunction with the upgrade, Fitch revised its outlook to Stable. 
 
 In December 2023, Moody s affirmed its outlook for the U.S. life insurance sector as stable. Also, in November 2023, Fitch changed its outlook from neutral to improving for the North American life insurance sector. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We have obligations for the return of non-cash collateral under an amendment to our securities lending program. Non-cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program may not be sold or re-pledged by our lending agent, except in the event of default, and is not reflected on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For information regarding obligations under this program, see the Investments Note in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 For changes in commitments related to the acquisition of mortgage loans and the purchase of limited partnerships and private placement investments, see the Commitments and Contingencies Note in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on-going basis based on historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that is reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will conform to estimates and assumptions and that reported results of operations will not be materially affected by the need to make future accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time. Those estimates are inherently subject to change and actual results could differ from those estimates, and the differences may be material to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 We have identified the following accounting judgments and estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability: 
 Valuation of investments and derivatives; 
 Investment impairments; 
 Income taxes; and 
 Contingencies 
 
 In developing these accounting estimates, we make subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material changes as facts and circumstances develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, we believe that the amounts provided are appropriate based on the facts available upon preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 The above critical accounting estimates are described in the Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Note in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Income Taxes 
 
 In August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax ("CAMT"). The CAMT is effective in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. In September 2024, the Department of Treasury issued proposed regulations providing additional guidance on the CAMT. Based on the proposed regulations, we do not expect to be subject to the CAMT for 2024. 
 
 See the Income Taxes Note to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on income taxes. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information relating to the Company required to be disclosed in the Company's periodic SEC filings is made known to them in a timely manner. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes to the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
