 The primary circumstances supporting these impairments were: (i) unmarketability of certain compression units into the foreseeable future, (ii) excessive maintenance costs associated with certain fleet assets, and (iii) prohibitive retrofitting costs that likely would prevent certain compression units from securing customer acceptance. These compression units were written down to their estimated salvage values, if any.

 The Credit Agreement matures on December 8, 2026. The Credit Agreement has an aggregate commitment of billion (subject to availability under our borrowing base). The Partnership s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the guarantors party to the Credit Agreement, which currently consists of all of the Partnership s subsidiaries. In addition, under the Credit Agreement the Partnership s Secured Obligations (as defined therein) are secured by: (i) substantially all of the Partnership s assets and substantially all of the assets of the guarantors party to the Credit Agreement, excluding real property and other customary exclusions; and (ii) all of the equity interests of the Partnership s U.S. restricted subsidiaries (subject to customary exceptions). 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement of million and, after accounting for outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million, million of remaining unused availability, of which, due to restrictions related to compliance with the applicable financial covenants, million was available to be drawn. Our weighted-average interest rate in effect for all borrowings under the Credit Agreement for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was , and our weighted-average interest rate under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024, was .

In addition, the Partnership may increase the applicable ratio by for any fiscal quarter during which a Specified Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement) occurs and for the following two fiscal quarters, but in no event shall the maximum ratio exceed to 1.00 for any fiscal quarter as a result of such increase. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the Credit Agreement. For purposes of the above covenants, EBITDA is calculated as set forth in the Credit Agreement. 
 The Credit Agreement is a revolving credit facility that includes a lockbox arrangement, whereby remittances from customers are made to a bank account controlled by the administrative agent. While we are not required by the terms of the Credit Agreement to use these customer remittances to reduce borrowings under the facility unless certain events of default occur under the Credit Agreement or unused availability under the facility is reduced below million, we have in the past routinely applied such remittances to reduce borrowings under the facility. 
 Issuance of Senior Notes 2029 
 On March 18, 2024, the Partnership and Finance Corp co-issued the Senior Notes 2029, a billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes that will mature on March 15, 2029.

 At any time prior to March 15, 2026, we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes 2029 at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, in an amount not greater than the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings, provided that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes 2029 remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption (excluding Senior Notes 2029 held by us and our subsidiaries) and redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such equity offering. 
 Prior to March 15, 2026, we may redeem all or a part of the Senior Notes 2029 at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) the principal amount thereof, plus (ii) a make-whole premium at the redemption date and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. 
 2027 2028 and thereafter 
 If we experience a change of control followed by a ratings decline, which ratings decline is caused by the applicable change of control event, unless we have previously exercised, or concurrently exercise, our right to redeem the Senior Notes 2029 (as described above), we may be required to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes 2029 at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.

As a result of the Defeasance, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represents the write-off of deferred financing costs of million and the difference between (i) the purchase price of U.S. government securities of million and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of the Senior Notes 2026 of million at the time of Defeasance.

to approximately million, including penalties and interest. 
 Our U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2019 and 2020 currently are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service IRS ). The IRS has issued preliminary partnership examination changes, along with imputed underpayment computations, for the 2019 and 2020 tax years. Under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, there are several procedural steps, including an appeals process, to complete before a final imputed underpayment, if any, is determined. Based on discussions with the IRS, we estimate a potential range of loss from a final imputed underpayment of to approximately million, including interest, for potential adjustments resulting from the IRS examinations. Once a final partnership imputed underpayment, if any, is determined, our General Partner may elect to either pay the imputed underpayment (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly to the IRS or, if eligible, issue a revised information statement to each unitholder, and former unitholder, with respect to an audited and adjusted return.

 ________________________________ 
 (1) Fleet horsepower is horsepower for compression units that have been delivered to us. 
 (2) Total available horsepower is revenue-generating horsepower under contract for which we are billing a customer, horsepower in our fleet that is under contract but is not yet generating revenue, horsepower not yet in our fleet that is under contract but not yet generating revenue and that is expected to be delivered, and idle horsepower. Total available horsepower excludes new horsepower expected to be delivered for which we do not have an executed compression services contract. 
 (3) Revenue-generating horsepower is horsepower under contract for which we are billing a customer. 
 (4) Calculated as the average of the month-end revenue-generating horsepower for each of the months in the period. 
 (5) Calculated as the average of the result of dividing the contractual monthly rate, excluding standby or other temporary rates, for all units at the end of each month in the period by the sum of the revenue-generating horsepower at the end of each month in the period. 
 (6) Calculated as the average of the month-end revenue-generating horsepower per revenue-generating compression unit for each of the months in the period. 
 (7) Horsepower utilization is calculated as (i) the sum of (a) revenue-generating horsepower, (b) horsepower in our fleet that is under contract but is not yet generating revenue, and (c) horsepower not yet in our fleet that is under contract but not yet generating revenue and that is expected to be delivered, divided by (ii) total available horsepower less idle horsepower that is under repair. Horsepower utilization based on revenue-generating horsepower and fleet horsepower as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 92.4 and 90.9 , respectively. 
 (8) Calculated as the average utilization for the months in the period based on utilization at the end of each month in the period. Average horsepower utilization based on revenue-generating horsepower and fleet horsepower for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 92.3 and 90.0 , respectively. Average horsepower utilization based on revenue-generating horsepower and fleet horsepower for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 91.5 and 88.7 , respectively. 
 The 3.4 increase in fleet horsepower as of September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023, primarily was driven by new compression units added to our fleet to meet incremental demand from customers for our compression services. 
 The increases in revenue-generating horsepower, average horsepower per revenue-generating compression unit, horsepower utilization, and horsepower utilization based on revenue-generating horsepower and fleet horsepower as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023, primarily were driven by the addition and deployment of new, and redeployment of existing, large-horsepower compression units due to increased demand for our services commensurate with an overall increase in crude oil and natural gas produced within the U.S. 
 The 7.9 and 8.7 increases in average revenue per revenue-generating horsepower per month for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily were due to higher market-based rates on newly deployed and redeployed compression units, and CPI-based and other market-based price increases on existing customer contracts that occur as market conditions permit.

 Contract operations revenue . The 15.8 million increase in contract operations revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily was due to (i) a 7.9 increase in average revenue per revenue-generating horsepower per month, as a result of higher market-based rates on newly deployed and redeployed compression units, and CPI-based and other market-based price increases on existing customer contracts that occur as market conditions permit and (ii) a 6.1 increase in average revenue-generating horsepower as a result of increased demand for our services, commensurate with an overall increase in crude oil and natural gas produced within the U.S., partially offset by (iii) a 5.0 million decrease in contract operations revenue from existing customers acquired by Energy Transfer since the previous period that are now classified as related-party revenue in the current period and (iv) a 3.5 million decrease in revenue attributable to natural gas treating services. 
 Average revenue per revenue-generating horsepower per month associated with our compression services provided on a month-to-month basis did not differ significantly from the average revenue per revenue-generating horsepower per month associated with our compression services provided under contracts in their primary term during the period. 
 Parts and service revenue . The 1.4 million decrease in parts and service revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily was due to a decrease in maintenance work performed on units at customer locations that are outside the scope of our core maintenance activities and that are offered as a convenience, and in directly reimbursable freight and crane charges that are the financial responsibility of the customers. Demand for retail parts and services fluctuates from period to period based on varying customer needs. 
 Related-party revenue . Related-party revenue was earned through related-party transactions that occur in the ordinary course of business with various affiliated entities of Energy Transfer. The 8.5 million increase in related-party revenue for the 
 21 

Table of Contents 

three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily was due to revenue recognized from existing customers acquired by Energy Transfer since the previous period that are now classified as related-party revenue in the current period. 
 Cost of operations, exclusive of depreciation and amortization . The 6.9 million increase in cost of operations, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily was due to (i) a 3.7 million increase in direct labor costs due to increased headcount associated with increased revenue-generating horsepower and higher employee costs, (ii) a 3.7 million increase in direct expenses, primarily driven by increased parts expense, (iii) a 0.6 million increase in indirect expenses, and (iv) a 0.6 million increase in non-income taxes, partially offset by (v) a 1.1 million decrease in retail parts and service expenses, for which a corresponding decrease in parts and service revenue also occurred, and (vi) a 0.6 million decrease in outside maintenance costs due to reduced use of third-party labor during the current period. 
 The increases in direct expenses, indirect expenses, and non-income taxes are primarily due to increased revenue-generating horsepower. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense . The 3.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily was due to (i) overhauls and major improvements to compression units and (ii) new trucks added to our vehicle fleet. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expense . The 4.7 million decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily was due to a 5.4 million decrease in unit-based compensation expense, attributable to mark-to-market changes to our unit-based compensation liability that occurred as a result of changes to our per-unit trading price as of September 30, 2024. 
 Gain on disposition of assets. The 3.9 million gain on disposition of assets for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily was due to the sale of certain natural gas treating assets to an existing customer. 
 Impairment of compression equipment . The 0.9 million impairment of compression equipment for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily resulted from our evaluation of the future deployment of our idle fleet under then-current market conditions. The primary circumstances supporting this impairment were: (i) unmarketability of certain compression units into the foreseeable future, (ii) excessive maintenance costs associated with certain fleet assets, and (iii) prohibitive retrofitting costs that likely would prevent certain compression units from securing customer acceptance. These compression units were written down to their estimated salvage values, if any. 
 As a result of our evaluation during the three months ended September 30, 2023, we retired three compression units representing approximately 2,100 of aggregate horsepower that previously were used to provide compression services in our business. 
 No impairment of compression equipment was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest expense, net . The 6.1 million increase in interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily was due to increased aggregate borrowings and higher aggregate weighted-average interest rates under the Credit Agreement and refinanced senior notes. 
 Gain (loss) on derivative instrument. The 6.2 million loss on derivative instrument for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the 3.4 million gain on derivative instrument for the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulted from the change in fair value of the interest-rate swap due to changes in the interest-rate forward curve and cash received during the respective periods. 
 Income tax expense. The 0.5 million increase in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily was related to deferred income taxes associated with the Texas Margin Tax.

The 16.0 million increase in Adjusted gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was due to a 22.9 million increase in revenues, offset by a 6.9 million increase in cost of operations, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. 
 The 59.9 million increase in Adjusted gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due to an 83.4 million increase in revenues, offset by a 23.5 million increase in cost of operations, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. 
 Adjusted EBITDA . The 15.5 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily was due to a 16.0 million increase in Adjusted gross margin, partially offset by a 0.7 million increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, transaction expenses, and severance charges. 
 The 55.4 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily was due to a 59.9 million increase in Adjusted gross margin, partially offset by a 4.7 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, transaction expenses, and severance charges. 
 DCF . The 15.0 million increase in DCF for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily was due to (i) a 16.0 million increase in Adjusted gross margin and (ii) a 7.8 million decrease in distributions on Preferred Units following the conversion of 320,000 Preferred Units into 15,990,804 common units during 2024, partially offset by (iii) a 5.7 million increase in cash interest expense, net, (iv) a 2.0 million increase in maintenance capital expenditures, (v) a 0.7 million increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation expense, transaction expenses, and severance charges, and (vi) a 0.5 million decrease in cash received on derivative instrument.

 For additional information regarding the conversion of the Preferred Units, see Note 9 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements of this report. 
 DCF Coverage Ratio . The increases in DCF Coverage Ratio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due to the increase in DCF for each period, partially offset by increased distributions due to an increase in the number of common units, largely attributable to the conversion of 320,000 Preferred Units into 15,990,804 common units during 2024 and the conversion of warrants into 2,360,488 common units in November 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We operate in a capital-intensive industry, and our primary liquidity needs include financing the purchase of additional compression units, making other capital expenditures, servicing our debt, funding working capital, and paying cash distributions on our outstanding preferred and common equity. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities, borrowings under the Credit Agreement, and issuances of debt and equity securities, including common units under the DRIP. 
 We believe cash generated by operating activities and, where necessary, borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to service our debt, fund working capital, fund our estimated expansion capital expenditures, fund our maintenance capital expenditures, and pay distributions to our unitholders for the next 12 months. 
 Because we distribute all of our available cash, which excludes prudent operating reserves, we expect to fund any future expansion capital expenditures or acquisitions primarily with capital from external financing sources, such as borrowings under the Credit Agreement and issuances of debt and equity securities, including under the DRIP. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 The compression services business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain, expand, and upgrade existing operations. Our capital requirements primarily have consisted of, and we anticipate that our capital requirements will continue primarily to consist of, the following: 
 maintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to maintain the operating capacity of our assets and extend their useful lives, to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining our existing business and related operating income; and 
 expansion capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to expand the operating capacity or operating-income capacity of assets, including by acquisition of compression units or through modification of existing compression units to increase their capacity, or to replace certain partially or fully depreciated assets that at the time of replacement were not generating operating income. 
 We classify capital expenditures as maintenance or expansion on an individual-asset basis. Over the long term, we expect that our maintenance capital expenditure requirements will continue to increase as the overall size and age of our fleet increases. Our aggregate maintenance capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 23.8 million and 18.6 million, respectively. We currently plan to spend between 27.0 million and 30.0 million in maintenance capital expenditures for the year 2024, including parts consumed from inventory. 
 Without giving effect to any equipment that we may acquire pursuant to any future acquisitions, we currently plan to spend between 240.0 million and 250.0 million in expansion capital expenditures for the year 2024. Our expansion capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 205.9 million and 185.3 million, respectively.

Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 211,139 180,281 Net cash used in investing activities (175,094) (153,391) Net cash used in financing activities (35,977) (26,919) 
 Net cash provided by operating activities . The 30.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily was due to (i) an increase in cash flows from a 59.9 million increase in Adjusted gross margin and (ii) a 7.6 million decrease in cash paid for interest, net of capitalized amounts, driven by the Defeasance of the Senior Notes 2026, partially offset by (iii) a 39.0 million increase in inventory purchases. 
 Net cash used in investing activities . The 21.7 million increase in net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due to (i) a 16.8 million increase in capital expenditures, for purchases of new compression units, overhauls and major improvements, and purchases of other equipment, (ii) a 4.4 million decrease in proceeds from disposition of property and equipment, and (iii) a 0.5 million decrease in proceeds from insurance recovery. 
 Net cash used in financing activities . The 9.1 million increase in net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily was due to (i) a 748.8 million increase in investments in government securities purchased in connection with the Defeasance of the Senior Notes 2026, (ii) a 235.7 million decrease in net borrowings under the Credit Agreement, (iii) an 18.2 million increase in deferred financing costs driven by the issuance of the Senior Notes 2029, and (iv) a 22.1 million increase in common unit distributions, partially offset by (v) a 1.0 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of the Senior Notes 2029 and (vi) a 16.6 million decrease in Preferred Unit distributions. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement of 803.2 million and, after accounting for outstanding letters of credit in the amount of 0.5 million, 796.3 million of remaining unused availability, of which, due to restrictions related to compliance with the applicable financial covenants, 641.8 million was available to be drawn. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement of 831.8 million and outstanding letters of credit of 0.5 million. 
 For a more detailed description of the Credit Agreement, see Note 8 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements of this report and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Senior Notes 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 750.0 million and 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding on our Senior Notes 2027 and Senior Notes 2029, respectively. 
 On March 5, 2024, we provided notice to the holders of our Senior Notes 2026 that, contingent on receipt of the proceeds from the Senior Notes 2029, the Senior Notes 2026 would be redeemed at par on April 4, 2024. On March 18, 2024, utilizing a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes 2029, we deposited government securities with the trustee to satisfy and discharge the Senior Notes 2026 under the Indenture governing the notes. This satisfaction and discharge constituted a legal defeasance, or the Defeasance, under GAAP as of March 18, 2024 of the full outstanding principal balance of 725.0 million. The Senior Notes 2026 were redeemed in full at par on April 4, 2024. 
 The Senior Notes 2027 are due on September 1, 2027, and accrue interest at the rate of 6.875 per year. Interest on the Senior Notes 2027 is payable semi-annually in arrears on each of March 1 and September 1.

Table of Contents 

The Senior Notes 2029 are due on March 15, 2029, and accrue interest at the rate of 7.125 per year. Interest on the Senior Notes 2029 is payable semi-annually in arrears on each of March 15 and September 15, commencing on September 15, 2024. Net proceeds from the Senior Notes 2029 were used for the Defeasance, with the remainder used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement. 
 For more detailed descriptions of the Defeasance, Senior Notes 2027, and Senior Notes 2029, see Note 8 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements of this report and, for the Senior Notes 2027, Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Derivative Instrument 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we elected to terminate an interest-rate swap we previously used to manage interest-rate risk associated with the floating-rate Credit Agreement, see Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements of this report for additional information on this interest-rate swap and termination. 
 DRIP 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, distributions of 1.1 million were reinvested under the DRIP resulting in the issuance of 46,018 common units. Such distributions are treated as non-cash transactions in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows included under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements of this report. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted Gross Margin 
 Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted gross margin as revenue less cost of operations, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. We believe Adjusted gross margin is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating profitability. Adjusted gross margin primarily is impacted by the pricing trends for service operations and cost of operations, including labor rates for service technicians, volume, and per-unit costs for lubricant oils, quantity and pricing of routine preventative maintenance on compression units, and property tax rates on compression units. Adjusted gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, gross margin or any other measure presented in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, our Adjusted gross margin, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Because we capitalize assets, depreciation and amortization of equipment is a necessary element of our cost structure. To compensate for the limitations of Adjusted gross margin as a measure of our performance, we believe it is important to consider gross margin determined under GAAP, as well as Adjusted gross margin, to evaluate our operating profitability. 
 The following table reconciles Adjusted gross margin to gross margin, its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods presented (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total revenues 239,968 217,085 704,557 621,129 Cost of operations, exclusive of depreciation and amortization (81,814) (74,928) (235,048) (211,515) Depreciation and amortization (67,237) (64,101) (195,801) (183,626) Gross margin 90,917 78,056 273,708 225,988 Depreciation and amortization 67,237 64,101 195,801 183,626 Adjusted gross margin 158,154 142,157 469,509 409,614

Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and income tax expense (benefit). We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus impairment of compression equipment, impairment of goodwill, interest income on capital leases, unit-based compensation expense (benefit), severance charges, certain transaction expenses, loss (gain) on disposition of assets, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss (gain) on derivative instrument, and other. We view Adjusted EBITDA as one of management s primary tools for evaluating our results of operations, and we track this item on a monthly basis as an absolute amount and as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior month, year-to-date, prior year, and budget. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess: 
 the financial performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure, or the historical cost basis of our assets; 
 the viability of capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; 
 the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make debt payments and pay distributions; and 
 our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in our industry without regard to the impact of financing methods and capital structure. 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, it may provide a more complete assessment of our performance as compared to considering solely GAAP results. We also believe that external users of our financial statements benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses to evaluate the results of our business. 
 Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure presented in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, our Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 Because we use capital assets, depreciation, impairment of compression equipment, loss (gain) on disposition of assets, and the interest cost of acquiring compression equipment also are necessary elements of our aggregate costs. Unit-based compensation expense related to equity awards granted to employees also is a meaningful business expense. Therefore, measures that exclude these cost elements have material limitations. To compensate for these limitations, we believe that it is important to consider net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities as determined under GAAP, as well as Adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate our financial performance and liquidity. Our Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, and these excluded items may vary among companies. Management compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool by reviewing comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures, and incorporating this knowledge into their decision making.

 (1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, unit-based compensation expense included 1.0 million and 3.0 million, respectively, of cash payments related to quarterly payments of DERs on outstanding phantom unit awards. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, unit-based compensation expense included 1.1 million and 3.3 million, respectively, of cash payments related to quarterly payments of DERs on outstanding phantom unit awards. The remainder of unit-based compensation expense for all periods was related to non-cash adjustments to the unit-based compensation liability. 
 (2) Represents certain expenses related to potential and completed transactions and other items. We believe it is useful to investors to exclude these expenses. 
 (3) This loss on extinguishment of debt is a result of the Defeasance of the Senior Notes 2026. This amount represents the write-off of deferred financing costs of 4.3 million and the difference between (i) the purchase price of U.S. government securities of 748.8 million and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of the Senior Notes 2026 of 748.1 million at the time of Defeasance. 
 (4) Represents non-cash charges incurred to decrease the carrying value of long-lived assets with recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through future cash flows.

Distributable Cash Flow 
 We define DCF as net income (loss) plus non-cash interest expense, non-cash income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, unit-based compensation expense (benefit), impairment of compression equipment, impairment of goodwill, certain transaction expenses, severance charges, loss (gain) on disposition of assets, loss on extinguishment of debt, change in fair value of derivative instrument, proceeds from insurance recovery, and other, less distributions on Preferred Units and maintenance capital expenditures. 
 We believe DCF is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors, and others to compare the cash flows that we generate (after distributions on the Preferred Units but prior to any retained cash reserves established by the General Partner and the effect of the DRIP) to the cash distributions that we expect to pay our common unitholders. 
 DCF should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure presented in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, our DCF, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 Because we use capital assets, depreciation, impairment of compression equipment, loss (gain) on disposition of assets, the interest cost of acquiring compression equipment, and maintenance capital expenditures are necessary components of our aggregate costs. Unit-based compensation expense related to equity awards granted to employees also is a meaningful business expense. Therefore, measures that exclude these cost elements have material limitations. To compensate for these limitations, we believe that it is important to consider net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities as determined under GAAP, as well as DCF, to evaluate our financial performance and liquidity. Our DCF excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, and these excluded items may vary among companies. Management compensates for the limitations of DCF as an analytical tool by reviewing comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures, and incorporating this knowledge into their decision making.

Maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to maintain the operating capacity of our assets and extend their useful lives, replace partially or fully depreciated assets, or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining our existing business and related cash flow. 
 DCF Coverage Ratio 
 DCF Coverage Ratio is defined as the period s DCF divided by distributions declared to common unitholders in respect of such period. We believe DCF Coverage Ratio is an important measure of operating performance because it permits management, investors, and others to assess our ability to pay distributions to common unitholders out of the cash flows that we generate. Our DCF Coverage Ratio, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. We do not take title to any natural gas or crude oil in connection with our rendered services, and accordingly, we do not bear direct exposure to fluctuating commodity prices. However, the demand for our compression services depends on the continued demand for, and production of, natural gas and crude oil. Sustained low natural gas or crude oil prices over the long term could result in a decline in the production of natural gas or crude oil, which could result in reduced demand for our compression services. We do not intend to hedge our indirect exposure to fluctuating commodity prices. A one percent decrease in average revenue-generating horsepower during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would result in an annual decrease of approximately 8.6 million and 5.7 million in our revenue and Adjusted gross margin, respectively. Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of Adjusted gross margin to gross margin, its most directly comparable financial measure, calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read Part I, Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non-GAAP Financial Measures of this report. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk due to variable interest rates under the Credit Agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 803.2 million of variable-rate indebtedness outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 7.50 . Based on our September 30, 2024 variable-rate indebtedness outstanding, a one percent increase or decrease, respectively, in the effective interest rate would result in an annual increase or decrease, respectively, in our interest expense of approximately 8.0 million. 
 For further information regarding our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our debt obligations, see Note 8 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements of this report. 
 In August 2024, we elected to terminate an interest-rate swap we previously used to manage interest-rate risk associated with the floating-rate Credit Agreement, see Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements of this report for additional information on this interest-rate swap and termination. 
 Credit Risk 
 Our credit exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided. If any significant customer of ours should have credit or financial problems resulting in a delay or failure to pay the amount it owes us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based on the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 Security holders and potential investors in our securities should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report, and in subsequent filings we make with the SEC.

 In connection with our recent announcement of the implementation of an Energy Transfer LP shared services model, including with respect to Human Resources, and the impact of such announcement on his current role, Sean T.
