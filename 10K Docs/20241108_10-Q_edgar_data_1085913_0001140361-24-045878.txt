months to years. Historical
 credit loss experience, which is based on peer information, provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made, using qualitative factors, when management expects current
 conditions and economic forecasts to differ from the conditions that existed for the period over which historical information was evaluated. The ACL is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for expected credit losses over the life of
 the loan based on evaluating historical credit loss experience and making adjustments to historical loss information for differences in the specific risk characteristics in the current loan portfolio. These factors include, among others,
 changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, differences in underwriting standards, delinquency rates, actual loss experience and current economic conditions.

loan segments used in preparing regulatory Call Reports to segment its portfolio and to extract the relevant information needed to calculate its ACL. This
 allows management the ability to obtain historical loss information for itself as well as its peer groups. Additionally, management s third party ALM application also utilizes a similar loan segmentation in calculating weighted average
 remaining life and duration including estimated prepayments. Management uses the duration of each loan segment to estimate the remaining life of loans to ensure that the model covers credit losses over the expected life of such loans.

loan
 segments over this time horizon using information available from the Federal regulators using FFIEC call report data for all segments except for farmland and agricultural loan segments, which utilize Federal Reserve Economic Data
 (FRED). Federal regulators have placed the Company into a peer group of banks with assets between billion to billion. This peer group segmentation includes approximately banks nationally. This peer group is similar in asset size and concentration with the exception of the agricultural portfolio as the Company is the 15 th largest agricultural lender in the country. As a result, none of the banks in the above national peer group have an agricultural concentration similar to
 the Company. Therefore, for purposes of historical losses, the Company uses the asset size peer group loss information for all loan segments except farmland and agricultural loans which uses a national peer group regardless of asset
 size. Using these peer groups, the model calculates the mean historical loss rate over the respective economic credit cycles described above for both the Company and its peer groups. Prior to the third quarter of 2024, the Company did
 use its own historical loss information for the farmland and agricultural loan segments, however this was changed to accommodate the new historical loss period discussed in the previous paragraph. Additionally, prior to the third
 quarter of 2024, the mean historical loss rates derived in the above process were then adjusted by a standard deviation calculation based on management s reasonable and supportable forecasts. However, in the third quarter of 2024 the
 standard deviation calculation was removed and replaced with a linear loss calculation over the defined economic credit cycles which management believes reduces the extent of management judgments in determination of the forecast.

available-for-sale securities of which were in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and securities were in an
 unrealized loss position for twelve months or more without an allowance for credit losses. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality and because the Company does not have the intent to
 sell and it is likely that the Company will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery at maturity, it has been determined that there is no expected credit loss. Management evaluates the available-for-sale securities
 in an unrealized loss position, relying primarily on industry analyst reports and observations of market conditions and interest rate fluctuations.

Item 2. 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion is intended to provide a more comprehensive review of the Company s operating results and financial condition. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with
 the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q included in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements. 

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

This Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act. These
 forward-looking statements reflect our current views and are not historical facts. These statements may include statements regarding projected performance for periods following the date of this report. These statements can generally be identified
 by use of phrases such as believe, expect, will, seek, should, anticipate, estimate, intend, plan, target, project, commit or other words of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe our future financial
 condition, results of operations, objectives, strategies, plans, goals or future performance and business are also forward-looking statements. Statements that project future financial conditions, results of operations, and shareholder value are
 not guarantees of performance and many of the factors that will determine these results and values are beyond our ability to control or predict. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements
 contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited to, those described in the Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections and other parts of this report and the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 Form 10-K ), could cause actual results to differ materially from those
 anticipated in these forward-looking statements. The following is a non-exclusive list of factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q:

changes in general economic conditions, either nationally, in California, or in our local markets;

inflation, changes in interest rates, securities market volatility and monetary fluctuations;

increases in competitive pressures among financial institutions and businesses offering similar products and services;

risks associated with negative events in the banking industry, and any legislative and/or bank regulatory actions, that could potentially impact earnings, liquidity and/or the availability of capital or which could increase the cost of
 our deposit insurance by the FDIC;

higher defaults in our loan and lease portfolio than we expect;

changes in management s estimate of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses;

risks associated with our growth and expansion strategy and related costs;

increased lending risks associated with our real estate loan portfolio;

legislative or regulatory changes or changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines;

technological changes;

operational risks, including processing, information systems, cybersecurity, vendor problems, business interruption, and fraud;

regulatory or judicial proceedings; and

other factors and risks including those described under Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this report and the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
 ended December 31, 2023.

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, expected, projected, intended,
 committed or believed. Please take into account that forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q (or documents incorporated by reference, if applicable).

Table of Contents 

The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly correct or update any forward-looking statements if it later becomes aware that actual results are likely to differ materially from those expressed in such
 forward-looking statements, except as required by law.

Overview

Farmers Merchants Bancorp (the Company or FMCB is a Delaware registered bank holding company organized in 1999. As a registered bank holding company, FMCB is subject to regulation, supervision, and
 examination by the Federal Reserve and by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation DFPI ). The Company s principal business is to serve as a holding company for Farmers Merchants Bank of Central California (the
 Bank or F M Bank ). The Bank was organized and incorporated in 1916 under the laws of the State of California as a non-Federal Reserve member, California state-chartered bank subject to primary regulation, supervision and examination by
 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and by the DFPI. The Bank serves its customers through 32 convenient locations including 29 full-service branches in Galt, Linden, Manteca, Riverbank, Modesto, Sacramento, Elk Grove, Turlock,
 Hilmar, Stockton, Merced, Walnut Creek, Concord, Walnut Grove, Oakland and Napa.

The Company s outstanding common stock as of September 30, 2024, consisted of 737,995 shares of common stock, 0.01 par value and no shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding as of September 30, 2024.
 The common stock of the Company is not widely held or listed on any exchange. However, trades are reported on the OTCQX under the symbol FMCB. 

The primary source of funding for the Company s growth has been the generation of core deposits, which the Company raises through its existing branch locations, newly opened branch locations, or through
 acquisitions. Loan growth over the years is the result of organic growth generated by the Company s seasoned relationship managers and supporting associates who provide outstanding service and responsiveness to the Company s clients.

The Company s results of operations are largely dependent on net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets, which are comprised of loans and
 leases, investment securities, short-term investments and interest bearing deposits at other banks, and the interest the Company pays on interest bearing liabilities, which are primarily deposits, and, to a lesser extent, other borrowings.
 Management strives to match the re-pricing characteristics of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to protect net interest income from changes in market interest rates and changes in the shape of the yield curve.

The Company measures its performance by calculating the net interest margin, return on average assets, return on average equity and the efficiency ratio. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest
 income, which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, by average interest earning assets. Net interest income is the Company s largest source of revenue. Interest
 rate fluctuations, as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities, combine to affect net interest income. The return on average assets is calculated by dividing the Company s net income by its total average assets and
 the return on average equity is calculated by dividing the Company s net income by its shareholder equity. The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition. We identify critical policies and estimates as those that require
 management to make particularly difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using
 different assumptions. These policies and estimates relate to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held-for-investment, investment securities, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets, fair value measurements and
 the realization of deferred income tax assets and liabilities.

38 

Table of Contents 

Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024.
 During the third quarter of 2024, updates were made to the accounting policy for the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases. See Note 1. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the updates that were
 made. The updates had no material impact to the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

See Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Non-GAAP Measurements

We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company s operational performance and to enhance investors overall understanding of such financial
 performance. The methodology for determining these non-GAAP measures may differ among companies. We used the following non-GAAP measures in this Form 10-Q:

Tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share: Given that the use of these measures is prevalent among banking regulators, investors, and analysts, we disclose them in
 addition the related GAAP measures of return on average equity and book value per common share. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measurements to the GAAP measurements are presented in the following tables for and as of the periods
 presented.

Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a better understanding of the Company s and its subsidiaries performance during each of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and
 2023 and the material changes in financial condition, operating income, and expense of the Company and its subsidiaries as shown in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. Information related to the comparison of the results
 of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 can be found in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024.

Table of Contents 

Factors that determine the level of net income include the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, yields earned and rates paid, fee income, non-interest expense, the level of non-performing
 loans and other non-earning assets, and the amount of non-interest bearing liabilities supporting earning assets. Non-interest income includes card processing fees, service charges on deposit accounts, bank-owned life insurance income,
 gains/losses on the sale of investment securities, and gains/losses on deferred compensation plan investments. Non-interest expense consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits, cost of deferred compensation benefits, occupancy, data
 processing, deposit insurance, marketing, professional services, and other expenses.

Third Quarter 2024 vs. Third Quarter 2023 

Interest-bearing deposits with banks and Federal Reserve balances are earning assets available to the Company. Average interest-bearing deposits with banks consisted
 primarily of FRB deposits. Balances with the FRB earned an average interest rate of 5.41 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Average interest-bearing
 deposits with banks were 286.1 million and 592.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in average interest-bearing deposits with banks was primarily due to the purchases of investment securities
 and funding of loans. Interest income on interest-bearing deposits with banks was 3.9 million and 8.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The investment portfolio is also a component of the Company s earning assets. Historically, the Company invested primarily in: (1) mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored entities; (2) debt
 securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, government agencies and government-sponsored entities; and (3) investment grade bank-qualified municipal bonds. However, at certain times the Company has selectively added investment grade corporate
 securities (floating rate and fixed rate with maturities less than 7 years) to the portfolio in order to obtain yields that exceed government agency securities of equivalent maturity. Since the risk factor for these types of investments is
 generally lower than that of loans and leases, the yield earned on investments is generally less than that of loans and leases.

Average total investment securities were 1.1 billion and 970.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in average investment securities was due to purchases of
 investment securities as part of repositioning the balance sheet. The average yield on total investment securities was 2.82 and 2.19 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Average loans and leases held for investment were 3.7 billion and 3.5 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average yield on the loan and lease portfolio was 6.13 and 5.87 
 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the loan yield reflects the increase in average loan balances and the increase in market interest rates over the last year.

Average interest-bearing deposits were 3.3 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits was 2.00 and 1.47 for the quarter ended
 September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was 16.4 million and 12.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the increases driven by increases in
 short-term market interest rates and customers seeking higher rates on deposit products. The average rate paid on total funding costs was 1.41 and 1.03 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Average interest-bearing deposits with banks consisted primarily of FRB deposits. Balances with the FRB earned an average interest rate
 of 5.46 and 5.08 for the first nine months ended of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Average interest-bearing deposits with banks were 358.2 million and 524.3 million for the nine months ended September
 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in average interest-bearing deposits with banks was primarily due to the purchases of investment securities and funding of loans. Interest income on interest-bearing deposits with banks was 14.6
 million and 19.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Average total investment securities were 1.1 billion and 1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in average investment securities was due to purchases of
 investment securities as part of repositioning the balance sheet. The average yield on total investment securities was 2.68 and 2.17 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the yield reflects the
 increase in yields on purchases over the last year.

Average loans and leases held for investment were 3.7 billion and 3.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average yield on the loan and lease portfolio was 6.11 and
 5.77 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the loan yield reflects the increase in average loan balances and the increase market interest rates over the last year.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 22.1 million and 66.6 million, respectively compared to 22.0 million and 66.9 million for the same periods a year ago. For the three months
 ended September 30, 2024 the slight increase in net income was primarily the result of no provision for credit losses compared to 3.0 million for the same period a year earlier and an increase in non-interest income of 2.7 million. These
 increases were offset by a 3.3 million increase in non-interest expense, a 1.4 million decrease in net interest income and higher income tax expense of 0.9 million.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in net income was primarily the result of lower net interest income of 7.1 million and a higher income tax expense of 4.6 million. In the first nine
 months of 2023, the Company also recognized in non-interest income, a 4.3 million death benefit on bank-owned life insurance BOLI which was offset by a 5.7 million loss on the sale of securities based on the decision to reposition the
 securities portfolio given the interest rate environment during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was offset by no provision for credit losses in 2024 compared to 7.1 million in 2023, and an increase in non-interest income
 of 3.6 million.

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin

For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net interest income was 52.0 million compared with 53.4 million, respectively. The decrease is primarily the result of the net interest margin (tax equivalent
 basis) decreasing 10 basis points to 4.07 compared with 4.17 for the same period a year earlier. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily the result of the increase in deposit costs due to the interest rate environment as the
 federal funds rate increased by 25 basis points during the third quarter of 2023 and customer expectations for higher rates on deposit products. The loan yield increased 26 basis points from 5.87 to 6.13 compared to the third quarter of 2023.
 The cost of interest bearing deposits increased 53 basis points from 1.47 to 2.00 and outpaced the increase in loan yield over the same period a year earlier. The cost of average total deposits increased 38 basis points from 1.01 to 1.39 .

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net interest income was 154.5 million compared with 161.6 million, respectively. The decrease is primarily the result of the net interest margin (tax
 equivalent basis) decreasing 29 basis points to 4.04 compared with 4.33 for the same period a year earlier. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily the result of the increase in deposit costs due to the interest rate environment
 as the federal funds rate increased by 100 basis points during the first nine months of 2023 and customer expectations for higher rates on deposit products. The loan yield increased 34 basis points from 5.77 to 6.11 the first nine months of
 2024. The cost of interest bearing deposits increased 93 basis points from 1.04 to 1.97 and outpaced the increase in loan yield over the same period a year earlier. The cost of average total deposits increased 69 basis points from 0.70 to
 1.39 .

Table of Contents 

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses in each period is a charge against earnings in that period. The provision is the amount required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level that, in management s
 judgment, is adequate to absorb expected credit losses, over the life of the loans and leases, unfunded loan commitments and HTM securities portfolios. The Company had no provision for credit losses during the three months ended September 30,
 2024 compared to 3.0 million for the same period a year ago. Net charge-offs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 216,000 compared to net recoveries of 47,000 for the same period a year ago.

The Company had no provision for credit losses during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 7.1 million during the first nine months of 2023. Net charge-offs during the first nine months of 2024 were 149,000
 compared to net recoveries of 274,000 in the first nine months of 2023.

Non-interest income was 6.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared with 3.6 million for the same period a year earlier. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to a 1.6 million
 increase in net gains on deferred compensation plan investments and 0.7 million net gain on sale of investment securities and a 0.1 million increase in other non-interest income.

The Company recorded net gains on deferred compensation plan investments of 1.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared with net losses of 0.3 million for the same respective period a year ago.
 See Note 10, located in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Company s December 31, 2023 Form 10-K filed on March 14, 2024 for a description of these plans. Balances in non-qualified deferred compensation plans may be
 invested in financial instruments whose market value fluctuates based upon trends in interest rates and stock prices. Although GAAP requires these investment gains/losses to be recorded in non-interest income, an offsetting entry is also required
 to be made to non-interest expense resulting in no net-effect on the Company s net income.

Non-interest income increased 3.6 million, or 28.84 , to 16.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 12.5 million for the same period of 2023. The year-over-year increase in
 non-interest income was primarily due to an increase of 6.4 million in net gains on sales of investment securities consisting of a 0.7 million net gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 5.7 million loss on sale of
 investment securities during the first quarter of 2023, an increase in net gains on deferred compensation plan investments of 1.0 million and a 0.3 million increase in cash surrender value of BOLI. These increases were partially offset with no
 gain on BOLI death benefits in 2024 compared to a 4.3 million gain in 2023.

The Company recorded net gains on deferred compensation plan investments of 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with net gains of 1.9 million for the same period a year earlier. See
 Note 10, located in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Company s December 31, 2023 Form 10-K filed on March 14, 2024 for a description of these plans. Balances in non-qualified deferred compensation plans may be invested

Non-interest expense increased 3.3 million, or 13.43 , to 27.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared with 24.5 million for the same period a year ago. This increase was primarily comprised of
 a 1.9 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a 1.6 million increase in net gains on deferred compensation plan investments, a 0.3 million increase in professional fees and a 0.3 million increase in data processing expenses. These
 increases were partially offset by a 1.0 million decrease in other non-interest expense. The decrease in other non-interest expenses was due primarily to the adoption of ASU 2023-02 which shifts the amortization of low-income housing tax credits
 to the income tax line under the proportional amortization method. For the third quarter of 2024 this amounted to 1.3 million.

Net gains on deferred compensation plan obligations were 1.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared with net losses of 0.3 million for the same respective period. See Note 10, located in Item
 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Company s December 31, 2023 Form 10-K filed on March 14, 2024 for a description of these plans. Balances in non-qualified deferred compensation plans may be invested in financial instruments
 whose market value fluctuates based upon trends in interest rates and stock prices. Although GAAP requires these gains on obligations to be recorded in non-interest expense, an offsetting entry is also required to be made to non-interest income
 resulting in no net-effect on the Company s net income.

Non-interest expense decreased 0.8 million, or 0.98 , to 78.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 79.5 million for the same period a year ago. This decrease was primarily comprised
 of a 2.8 million decrease in other miscellaneous expenses. The decrease in miscellaneous expenses was due primarily to the adoption of ASU 2023-02 which shifts the benefits of low-income housing tax credits to the income tax line under the
 proportional amortization method. For the first nine months of 2024 this amounted to 3.5 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of 1.0 million in net gain of deferred compensation plan investment, an increase of 0.7 million
 in data processing expenses, an increase of 0.2 million in marketing expenses and an increase of 0.2 million in occupancy expenses.

The Company recorded net gains on deferred compensation plan investments of 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with net gains of 1.9 million for the same respective period. See Note
 10, located in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Company s December 31, 2023 Form 10-K filed on March 14, 2024 for a description of these plans. Balances in non-qualified deferred compensation plans may be invested in

Income Tax Expense

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense was 8.4 million and 25.3 million, respectively compared to 7.5 million and 20.7 million for the same periods a year ago. The Company s
 effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 27.51 and 27.53 , respectively compared to 25.51 and 23.61 for the same period in 2023. The Company s higher income tax expense and effective tax rates for the first
 nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 was due in part to the adoption of ASC 2023-02 which shifts the amortization of low-income housing tax credits from other non-interest expense to the income tax line under the proportional amortization method
 thereby increasing income tax expense resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was also lower than normal due to the non-taxable BOLI death benefit gain of
 4.3 million in 2023. The Company s effective tax rate can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to changes in the mix of taxable and tax-exempt earning sources.

 deposits. Interest bearing deposits with banks totaled 198.6 million at September 30, 2024 and 338.4 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in interest-bearing deposits with banks was primarily due to the
 purchases of investment securities and funding of loans. The Company s total cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 represents 5.41 of the Company s total assets as compared to 7.73 as of December 31, 2023.

The Company s net investment portfolio increased by 181.9 million or 18.19 to 1.18 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was due to the purchase of 301.4
 million in investments securities during the first nine months of 2024 offset by normal principal maturities or pay downs and sales of 69.6 million. During the first nine months of 2024, as part of managing the investment portfolio and balance
 sheet, the portfolio mix has shifted as available-for-sale securities increased from 182.5 million as of December 31, 2023 to 401.6 million as of September 30, 2024 while the held-to-maturity securities decreased from 817.7 million as of
 December 31, 2023 to 780.5 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company s total investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024 represents 21.82 of the Company s total assets as compared to 18.84 at December 31, 2023.

Maturities are based on the final contractual payment dates, and do not reflect the impact of prepayments or early redemptions that may occur. Expected maturities of mortgage-backed and CMO securities may differ
 from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalties. The Company evaluates securities for expected credit losses at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or
 market concerns warrant such evaluation.

Loans and Leases

Non-Accrual Loans and Leases - Accrual of interest on loans and leases is generally discontinued when a loan or lease becomes contractually past due by 90 days or more with
 respect to interest or principal. When loans and leases are 90 days past due, but in management s judgment are well secured and in the process of collection, they may not be classified as non-accrual. When a loan or lease is placed on non-accrual
 status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed. Income on such loans and leases is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received and where the future collection of principal is probable. The Company had 677,000
 in non-accrual loans and leases as of September 30, 2024 and no non-accrual loans at December 31, 2023.

Other Real Estate Owned OREO represents real property taken either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the
 borrower. The Company records all OREO properties at amounts equal to or less than the fair market value of the properties based on current independent appraisals reduced by estimated selling costs. The Company reported 873,000 of
 foreclosed OREO at September 30, 2024, and at December 31, 2023.

Although management believes that non-performing loans and leases are generally well-secured and that potential losses are provided for in the Company s allowance for credit losses, there can be no assurance that
 future deterioration in economic conditions and/or collateral values will not result in future credit losses. See Note 3. Loans and Leases , located in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for an allocation of the
 allowance classified to collateral dependent loans and leases.

Allowance for Credit Losses Loans and Leases

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses ACL under ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
 Instruments CECL ). The allowance is established through a provision for credit losses, which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan
 and lease growth. Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance. The overall allowance consists of two primary
 components: specific reserves related to individually evaluated loans and leases and general reserves comprised of both quantitative and qualitative factors for current expected credit losses related to loans and leases that are not collateral
 dependent. The Company uses the Weighted Average Remaining Maturity WARM methodology to calculate the ACL, as this method is deemed the most appropriate given the Company s current size and complexity. See Summary of Significant Accounting
 Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses Loans and Leases. 

52 

Table of Contents 

The allowance for credit losses is the combination of the allowance for credit losses on loan and lease losses and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments. The ACL for unfunded loan
 commitments is included within Interest payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The following table presents information regarding the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment as of the dates

Deposits

Total deposits increased 40.6 million from 4.67 billion as of December 31, 2023 to 4.71 billion as of September 30, 2024. The Company has experienced fluctuations in deposits during the year due in part to the
 seasonality within our agriculture client base and customer behavior over the last year as customers seek higher yielding deposit products or other investment alternatives such as U.S. Treasuries or money market funds given the interest rate
 environment. During the third quarter deposits increased 111.6 million or 2.4 compared to June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has no brokered deposits.

Non-interest bearing demand deposits were 1.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Non-interest bearing deposits were 31.13 of total deposits, as of September 30, 2024 and 31.76 as of December
 31, 2023. Interest bearing deposits were 3.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Interest bearing deposits are comprised of interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts, and
 certificates of deposit. Checking account deposits were 50.01 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024 compared to 51.76 of total deposits as of December 31, 2023.

Deposits are gathered from individuals and businesses in our market areas. The interest rates paid are competitively priced for each particular deposit product and structured to meet our funding requirements. The
 increase in short-term interest rates during 2023 and customers seeking higher yielding deposit products continued to place pressure on deposit pricing. The average cost of total deposits, including non-interest bearing deposits, increased to
 1.39 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.01 for the same period a year ago and 1.14 as of December 31, 2023. The Company did reduce interest rates in September after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates resulting in
 a decrease in interest expense during the month of September.

The Bank participates in a program wherein the State of California places time deposits with the Bank at the Bank s option. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had 3.0 million, of these
 deposits.

Total estimated uninsured deposits based on our regulatory reporting amounted to 2.3 billion and 2.2 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Federal Reserve Bank Borrowings

Lines of Credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank and FRB are other key sources of funds to support earning assets and liquidity. These sources of funds are also used to manage the Company s interest rate risk
 exposure; and, as opportunities arise, to borrow and invest the proceeds at a positive spread through the investment portfolio. There were no FHLB advances at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. There were no Federal Funds purchased or
 advances from the FRB at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

Long-Term Subordinated Debentures

On December 17, 2003, the Company raised 10.0 million through the sale of subordinated debentures to an off-balance-sheet trust and its sale of trust-preferred securities. See Note 9. Long-Term Subordinated
 Debentures located in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024. Although this amount is reflected as subordinated debt on the Company s balance sheet, under
 current regulatory guidelines, our Trust Preferred Securities will continue to qualify as regulatory capital.

These securities accrue interest at a variable rate based upon 3-month SOFR plus 2.85 . Interest rates reset quarterly (the next reset is December 17, 2024) and the rate was 8.05 as of September 30, 2024 and 8.49 
 at December 31, 2023. The average rate paid for these securities was 8.58 for the first nine months of 2024 and 8.05 for the first nine months of 2023. Additionally, if the Company decided to defer interest on the subordinated debentures, the
 Company would be prohibited from paying cash dividends on the Company s common stock.

Capital Resources

The Company relies primarily on capital generated through the retention of earnings to satisfy its capital requirements. The Company engages in an ongoing assessment of its capital needs in order to support
 business growth and to insure depositor protection. Shareholders Equity totaled 602.7 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 52.9 million or 9.6 from 549.8 million at December 31, 2023.

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy guidelines as outlined under Part 324 of the FDIC Rules and Regulations. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain
 mandatory, and possibly discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s and the Bank s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt
 corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company and the Bank s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The
 Company and the Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of these capital requirements and there were no restrictions on the Company s business activity. As of September 30, 2024 the Bank met the
 requirements to be categorized as well-capitalized under the FDIC regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage
 ratios as set forth in the following tables as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

On September 10, 2024 the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the Repurchase Plan in which the Company may repurchase up to 55.0 million of the Company s common stock, which
 represented approximately 9 of outstanding shareholders equity at the time of approval. The new Repurchase Plan extends through December 31, 2026. The Board concurrently terminated the existing 25.0 million repurchase plan previously approved
 on November 14, 2023. Repurchases by the Company under the Repurchase Plan may be made from time to time through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with SEC rules, privately negotiated transactions, or by other means.

During the first nine months of 2024 the Company repurchased 9,976 shares under the Repurchase Plan, for a total of 10.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, there remains 55.0 million authorized for repurchases
 under the new Repurchase Plan. On October 3, 2024, the Company entered into and executed a Stock Purchase Agreement with the living trust of one of the Company s largest shareholders under which the Company repurchased 37,990 shares of common
 stock of the Company at a cost of 34.8 million. At the time of purchase, this transaction represented the repurchase of 5.15 of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock. The Company s total shares of common stock outstanding were
 reduced from 737,995 as of September 30, 2024 to 699,997 shares as a result of this transaction. The common stock was repurchased under the Company s 55.0 million share repurchase program which after the aforementioned transaction has
 approximately 20.1 million remaining which expires on December 31, 2026.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

Off-balance-sheet arrangements are any contractual arrangement to which an unconsolidated entity is a party, under which the Company has: (1) any obligation under a guarantee
 contract; (2) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity, or market risk support to that entity for such assets; (3) any obligation under certain
 derivative instruments; or (4) any obligation under a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or
 research and development services with the Company. The Company had the following off balance sheet commitments as of the dates indicated.

The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party with regard to standby letters of credit, undisbursed loan commitments, and financial guarantees is represented by the
 contractual notional amount of those instruments. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. The Company uses the same credit policies in making
 commitments and conditional obligations as it does for recorded balance sheet items. The Company may or may not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk. Evaluations of each customer s
 creditworthiness are performed on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, the Company maintains an allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments, which totaled 2.7 million and 3.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
 respectively.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee performance of or payment for a customer to a third-party. Most standby letters of credit have maturity dates ranging from 1
 to 48 months with final expiration in October 2028. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.

Liquidity

The ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors, creditors and regulators. In an effort to satisfy our liquidity needs, we actively manage
 our assets and liabilities. We have access to immediate liquid resources in the form of cash which totaled 293.3 million or 5.41 of total assets as of September 30, 2024. The majority of cash is on deposit with the FRB and amounted to 198.6
 million. Potential sources of liquidity also include investment securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio, our ability to sell loans in the secondary market, and our ability to borrow from the FRB and FHLB. Our diversified deposit
 portfolio has historically provided us with a long-term source of stable low cost funding. Maturities and payments on outstanding loans and investment securities also provide a steady flow of funds. Our liquidity, represented by cash borrowing
 lines, federal funds and available for sale securities, is a result of our operating, investing and financing activities and related cash flows. In order to ensure funds are available at all times, we devote resources to projecting the amount of
 funds that will be required and we maintain relationships with a diversified client base so funds are accessible. Liquidity requirements can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets. We had the following
 borrowing lines available at September 30, 2024:

We continued our focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position throughout the first nine months of 2024 and we believe our liquid assets and short-term borrowing credit lines are adequate to meet our cash flow
 needs for loan and lease funding and deposit cash withdrawals for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, we had internal sources of liquidity comprised of 293.3 million in cash and 381.4 million unencumbered investment securities,
 which represented in the aggregate 12.3 of total assets. We also had 2.1 billion in external sources of liquidity as outlined in the table above bringing our total available liquidity to 2.9 billion. Our pledged collateral on short-term
 borrowing lines is comprised of 2.8 billion in loans and 1.7 million in investment securities. We have the option of either borrowing on our credit lines or selling these investment securities for cash flow needs.

On a long-term basis, we intend to meet our liquidity needs by changing the relative distribution of our asset portfolios by reducing our investment or loan and lease volumes, or selling or encumbering assets.
 Further, we would increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities and/or borrowing from our correspondent banks as well as the FHLB. At the current time, our long-term liquidity needs primarily
 relate to funds required to support loan and lease originations and commitments and deposit withdrawals.

We believe we can meet all of these needs from existing liquidity sources. Our liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from or used in operating activities; cash flows from or used in
 investing activities; and cash flows from or used in financing activities. Net cash provided by or used in operating activities has consisted primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash income and expense items such as the credit loss
 provision, investment and other amortization and depreciation.

Our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and leases and purchases and sales of investment securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded loan commitments of 1.0 billion and unfunded
 letters of credit of 15.9 million. At September 30, 2024 we believe that we had sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments.

Item 3. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The Company s assessment of market risk at September 30, 2024 indicates there have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures from those made in the Company s Annual Report on Form
 10-K filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024.

Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Our market risk arises
 primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities. Management actively monitors and manages our interest rate risk exposure. We do not have any market-risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading
 purposes. In monitoring interest rate risk we continually analyze and manage our earning assets and funding liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and/or prepayments, and their sensitivity to
 actual or potential changes in market interest rates.

Management uses various asset/liability strategies to manage the re-pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities designed to ensure that exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited within our
 guidelines of acceptable levels of risk-taking. Hedging strategies, including the terms and pricing of loans and deposits, and managing the deployment of our securities, are considered to reduce mismatches in interest rate re-pricing
 opportunities of portfolio assets and their funding sources.

Since our earnings are primarily dependent on our ability to generate net interest income, we focus on actively monitoring and managing the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on our net interest income.
 Our Asset Liability Management Committee ALCO ), which is comprised of members of the Board of Directors and Executive Officers, manages market risk. ALCO monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact on net interest income from
 potential changes in interest rates, and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure. ALCO manages our balance sheet in part to maintain the potential impact of changes in interest rates on net interest
 income within acceptable ranges despite changes in interest rates. ALCO and management utilize a third party to assist with asset liability management including the use of simulation models.

60 

Table of Contents 

Our exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by ALCO. Interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine our change in net interest income
 in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates. If potential changes to net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest rate changes are not within risk tolerances determined by ALCO, and approved by the full Board of Directors,
 Management may make adjustments to the Company s asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk levels within the Board approved limits.

Net Interest Income Simulation. In order to measure interest rate risk, we use a simulation model to project changes in net interest income that result from forecasted
 changes in interest rates. This analysis calculates the difference between net interest income forecasted using a rising and a falling interest rate scenario and a net interest income forecast using a base market interest rate derived from the
 current treasury yield curve. The income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding the re-pricing relationships for each of our products. Many of our assets are floating rate loans, which are assumed to re-price immediately, and to
 the same extent as the change in market rates according to their contracted index.

Some loans and investment vehicles include the opportunity of prepayment (embedded options), and accordingly the simulation model uses various proprietary models to estimate these prepayments and assumes the
 reinvestment of the proceeds at current yields. Our non-term deposit products re-price more slowly, usually changing less than the change in market rates and at our discretion.

This analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions. It assumes the balance sheet size remains static throughout the simulation horizon by
 replacing existing cash flows/amortization into similar products at current rates to try and capture the ongoing activity of the balance sheet without forecasting any level of growth. It does not account for all factors that affect this analysis,
 including changes by management to mitigate the effect of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to our credit risk profile as interest rates change.

Furthermore, loan prepayment-rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly. Interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in
 this analysis. Changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on our net interest income.

For the rising and falling interest rate scenarios, the base market interest rate forecast was increased or decreased, on an instantaneous and sustained basis, by 100, 200 and 300 basis points. We then evaluate the
 simulation results using two approaches: Net Interest Income at Risk NII at Risk and Economic Value of Equity EVE ). Under NII at Risk, the impact on net interest income from the changes in interest rates on interest-earning assets and
 interest-bearing liabilities is modeled using various assumptions of assets and liabilities. EVE measures the period-end present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities. Management uses this value to measure the changes in the
 economic value of the Company under various interest rate scenarios.

Based on our quarterly simulations, our net interest margin exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within the current guidelines established by us. Our simulation model
 highlights the fact that our balance sheet is asset sensitive, which means that our net interest income rises in a rising interest rate environment as rates earned on our interest-bearing assets reprice higher at a faster pace than rates paid on
 our interest-bearing liabilities.

The ratio of variable to fixed-rate loans in our loan portfolio, the ratio of short-term (maturing at a given time within 12 months) to long-term loans, and the ratio of our demand, money market and savings
 deposits to CDs (and their time periods), are the primary factors affecting the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Our short-term loans are typically priced at prime plus a margin, and our long-term loans
 are typically priced based on a specific term of the Treasury Curve for comparable maturities, plus a margin. The composition of our rate-sensitive assets or liabilities is subject to change and could result in a more unbalanced position that
 would cause market rate changes to have a greater impact on our net interest margin. As of September 30, 2024, our loan and lease portfolio was comprised of 57.1 fixed rate and 43.0 variable rate loans. The vast majority of our variable loans
 also contain interest rate floors which are designed to mitigate the impact of decreases in interest rates as index rates drop.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of
 the disclosure controls and procedures (as required by Exchange Act Rules 240.13a-15(b) and 15d-14(a)). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the disclosure controls and
 procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and timely reported as
 provided in the SEC s rules and forms.
