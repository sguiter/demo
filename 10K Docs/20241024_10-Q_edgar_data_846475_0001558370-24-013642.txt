 Leased Total device revenue Supplies revenue Total revenue Revenues are estimated using the portfolio approach by third-party payer type based upon historical rates of collection, aging of receivables, trends in historical reimbursement rates by third-party payer types, and current relationships and experience with the third-party payers, which includes estimated constraints for third-party payer refund requests, deductions, allowance for uncollectible accounts, and billing allowance adjustments. Inherent in these estimates is the risk they will have to be revised as additional information becomes available and constraints are released. If initial estimates are updated, these changes are accounted for as increases or decreases in the transaction price. Assuming the underlying performance obligation to which the change in price relates has already been satisfied, those changes in transaction price are immediately recognized as increases or decreases in revenue (not credit losses (bad debt expense)) in the period in which the estimate changes. Additionally, the complexity of third-party payer billing arrangements, the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain products from third-party payers, or unanticipated requirements to refund payments previously received may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Settlements with third-party payers for retroactive revenue adjustments due to audits, reviews, or investigations are considered variable consideration and are included in the determination of the estimated transaction price using the expected amount method. These adjustments to transaction price are estimated based on the terms of the payment agreement with the payer, correspondence from the payer, and historical settlement activity, including an assessment to ensure that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the retroactive adjustment is subsequently resolved. Due to continuing changes in the healthcare industry and third-party payer reimbursement, it is possible the Company s forecasting model to estimate collections could change, which could have an impact on the Company s results of operations and cash flows. Any differences between estimated and actual collectability are reflected in the period in which payment is received. The Company monitors the variability and uncertain timing over third-party payer types in the portfolios. If there is a change in the Company s third-party payer mix over time, it could affect net revenue and related receivables. The Company believes it has a sufficient history of collection experience to estimate the net collectible amounts by third-party payer type. However, changes to constraints related to billing adjustments and refund requests have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. or a lease in the lease term when it is reasonably certain to exercise such options. The Company recognizes leases with an initial term of 12 months or less as lease expense over the lease term and those leases are not recorded on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Summary Net revenue was 50.0 million and 49.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 146.4 million and 137.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net revenue increased 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net revenue increased 7 or 9.3 million compared to the same period in 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, device orders increased 13 and 18 , respectively, from the same periods in 2023. Net income was 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 3.6 million during the same period in 2023. Net income was 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 8.5 million during the same period in 2023. Cash provided by operating activities was 10.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 11.6 million during the same period in 2023. Working capital was 58.5 million and 69.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Net Revenue Net revenues are comprised of device and supply sales, constrained by estimated third-party payer reimbursement deductions. The reserve for billing allowance adjustments and allowance for uncollectible accounts are adjusted on an ongoing basis in conjunction with the processing of third-party payer insurance claims and other customer collection history. Product device revenue is primarily comprised of sales and rentals of our electrotherapy products and also includes distributed rehabilitation products such as our cervical traction, lumbar support and hot/cold therapy products. Supplies revenue is primarily comprised of sales of our consumable supplies to patients using our electrotherapy products, consisting primarily of surface electrodes and batteries. Revenue related to both devices and supplies is reported net, after adjustments for estimated third-party payer reimbursement deductions and estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts. The deductions are known throughout the healthcare industry as billing adjustments whereby the healthcare insurers unilaterally reduce the amount they reimburse for our products as compared to the sales prices charged by us. The deductions from gross revenue also take into account the estimated denials, net of resubmitted billings of claims for products placed with patients which may affect collectability. See our Significant Accounting Policies in Note 2 to the condensed financial statements for a more complete explanation of our revenue recognition policies. We occasionally receive, and expect to continue to receive, refund requests from insurance providers relating to specific patients and dates of service. Billing and reimbursement disputes are very common in our industry. These requests are sometimes related to a few patients and other times include a significant number of refund claims in a single request. We review and evaluate these requests and determine if any refund is appropriate. We also review claims that have been resubmitted or where we are pursuing additional reimbursement from that insurance provider. We frequently have significant offsets against such refund requests which may result in amounts that are due to us in excess of the amounts of refunds requested by the insurance providers. Therefore, at the time of receipt of such refund requests we are generally unable to determine if a refund request is valid. Net revenue increased 0.1 million to 50.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 49.9 million for the same period in 2023. Net revenue increased 9.3 million or 7 to 146.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 137.0 million for the same period in 2023. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the growth in net revenue from the same periods in 2023 is primarily related to a 13 and 18 growth in device orders, respectively, which resulted from a larger customer base and led to increased sales of consumable supplies. Device Revenue Device revenue is related to the sale or lease of our products. Device revenue decreased 2.0 million or 12 to 14.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 16.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in device revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is related to a decreased headcount in the sales force and subsequently lower order growth rates, and an increase in distributed products which carry a lower average selling price. The items noted above were partially offset by a 13 increase in device orders during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Device revenue increased 2.3 million or 5 to 44.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 42.5 million for the same period in 2023.

Table of Contents 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the growth in device revenue from the same period in 2023 is primarily related to an 18 growth in device orders, partially offset by decreased headcount in the sales force and subsequently lower order growth rates, and an increase in distributed products which carry a lower average selling price. Supplies Revenue Supplies revenue is related to the sale of supplies, primarily electrodes and batteries, for our electrotherapy products. Supplies revenue increased 2.0 million or 6 to 35.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 33.1 million for the same period in 2023. Supplies revenue increased 7.1 million or 7 to 101.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 94.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in supplies revenue is primarily related to an increased customer base from increased device orders in 2023 and 2024. Operating Expenses Cost of Revenue Devices and Supplies Cost of revenue devices and supplies consist primarily of device and supply costs, facilities, operations labor, overhead, shipping, and depreciation. Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.6 million or 7 to 10.2 million from 9.6 million from the same period in 2023. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue devices and supplies increased to 20 from 19 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.4 million or 5 to 29.4 million from 28.1 million for the same period in 2023. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue device and supply decreased to 20 from 21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase in cost of revenue device and supply in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is due to the increased volumes related to increased revenue. Sales and Marketing Expense Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee-related costs, including commissions and other direct costs associated with these personnel including travel expenses, marketing, and related expenses. Sales and marketing expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.4 million or 6 to 20.7 million from 22.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in sales and marketing expense is primarily due to decreased headcount in the sales force, partially offset by increased commissions from increased orders. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense decreased to 41 from 44 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to the items noted above, partially offset by increased revenue. Sales and marketing expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.3 million or 4 to 67.3 million from 65.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily due to increased commission pay from increased orders, and increased head count in the sales operations department. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense decreased to 46 from 47 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the increase in revenue during the period. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee-related costs, and other direct costs associated with these personnel including facilities, travel expenses, professional fees, depreciation, and amortization. General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.5 million or 20 to 15.3 million from 12.7 million for the same period in 2023. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense increased to 31 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 26 for the same period in 2023. General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 7.6 million or 21 to 43.1 million from 35.5 million for the same period in 2023. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense increased to 29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 26 for the same period in 2023. The increase in general and administrative expense

Table of Contents 
 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 are primarily due to increased professional fees related to additional external resources, increased research and development expenses at ZMS, increased compensation and benefit expense related to headcount growth within the reimbursement departments, and increased orders. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is recorded at the end of each interim period based on the Company s best estimate of its effective income tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. The Company s effective income tax rate was 25 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Discrete items adjusted, primarily related to the tax impact of restricted stock vestings, were 0.2 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, discrete items adjusted were 1.1 million and 2.1) million, respectively, which were primarily related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration. The Company recorded income tax expense of 0.8 million and 1.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recorded income tax expense of 1.4 million and 2.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have historically financed operations through cash flows from operations, debt and equity transactions. At September 30, 2024, our principal source of liquidity was 37.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and 21.6 million in accounts receivable. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.3 million compared with net cash provided by operating activities of 11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in our cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to decreased profitability and increased inventory, partially offset by increased cash collections, which resulted in a decrease in the receivables balance. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.4 million and 10.4 million, respectively. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to the purchases of property and equipment related to the build out of our facility in Englewood for the operations of ZMS. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to the build out of our facility for the operations of ZMS and the purchase of short-term investments. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 16.9 million compared with net cash provided by financing activities of 21.2 million for the same period in 2023. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to purchases of 15.6 million in treasury stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Convertible Senior Notes of 57.0 million, which was partially offset by purchases of treasury stock of 24.4 million, and principal payments on long-term debt totaling 10.7 million. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, together with anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. In making this assessment, we considered the following: Our cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30, 2024 of 37.6 million; Our working capital balance of 58.5 million; Our projected income and cash flows for the next 12 months. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Please refer to the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements located within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024.

 COVID-19 UPDATE In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus COVID-19 emerged and spread to other countries, including the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic (the COVID-19 pandemic ). The COVID-19 pandemic, including multiple variants, resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, shelter in place and stay at home orders, travel restrictions, business interruptions and other measures. Although the World Health Organization declared an end to the COVID-19 pandemic on May 5, 2023, we continue to actively monitor the impact of COVID-19. While the Company did not incur significant disruptions to its operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from COVID-19, the full extent of COVID-19 on our operations and the markets we serve remains uncertain and will depend largely on future developments related to COVID-19, including infection rates increasing or returning in various geographic areas, variations of COVID-19, actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, such as reimposing previously lifted measures or putting in place additional restrictions, and the widespread distribution and acceptance of an effective vaccine, among other things. Future developments regarding COVID-19 and its effects cannot be accurately predicted. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK N/A. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on management s review, with participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described below. Material Weakness in Internal Control A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting : It was determined that as of December 31, 2023, the Company's primary change management controls were not designed and implemented effectively to ensure IT program and data changes affecting the Company s financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately to validate that data produced by its relevant IT system(s) were complete and accurate. Other Information Technology General Controls ITCGs ), automated process-level controls, and manual controls that are dependent upon the information derived from such financially relevant systems were also determined to be ineffective as a result of such deficiency. Business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted; Ineffective design and implementation of controls over the valuation of accounts receivable to properly address the risk of material misstatement. The material weakness identified above did not result in any material misstatements in our financial statements or disclosures, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. Our management concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, has been audited by Marcum LLP as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024.

Table of Contents 
 Remediation Plan Our management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. In response to the identified material weakness above, management will take comprehensive actions to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. We are in the process of developing and implementing remediation plans to address the material weakness described above. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except for the items referred to above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Control Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, claims are made against the Company in the ordinary course of business, which could result in litigation. Claims and associated litigation are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable outcomes could occur, such as monetary damages, fines, penalties, or injunctions prohibiting us from selling our products or engaging in other activities. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Items 2(a) and 2(b) are not applicable. (c) Stock Repurchases. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities On February 29, 2024, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a repurchase program of up to 20.0 million of the Company s common stock beginning on March 4, 2024, and continuing through the earlier of March 4, 2025, or when all 20.0 million worth of shares have been repurchased. Under the Company s repurchase program, the Company may repurchase its common stock from time to time in open market and negotiated transactions. Repurchases will be made subject to market conditions, available liquidity, cash flow, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The specific prices, numbers of shares, and timing of purchase transactions will be determined by the Company from time to time. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The repurchase program is intended to comply with Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
