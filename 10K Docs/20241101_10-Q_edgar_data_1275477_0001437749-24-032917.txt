business segments through its principal wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Royal Palm Capital LLC, which includes its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bimini Advisors Holdings, LLC. 
 
 Royal Palm Capital, LLC maintains an investment portfolio, consisting primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities MBS investments and shares of Orchid Island Capital, Inc. ("Orchid") common stock, for its own benefit. Royal Palm Capital, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are collectively referred to as "Royal Palm." 
 
 Bimini Advisors Holdings, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bimini Advisors, LLC (an investment advisor registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission), are collectively referred to as "Bimini Advisors." Bimini Advisors manages a MBS portfolio for Orchid and receives fees for providing these services. Bimini Advisors also provides certain repurchase agreement trading, clearing and administrative services to Orchid that were previously provided by a third party. Bimini Advisors also manages the MBS portfolio of Royal Palm. 
 
 reportable segments: the asset management segment and the investment portfolio segment. These segments are evaluated by management in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the Company s accounting policies with the exception that inter-segment revenues and expenses are included in the presentation of segment results. For further information see Note 13. 

Restricted cash 
 Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 

The Company maintains cash balances at several banks and excess margin with two exchange clearing members. At times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these balances. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures eligible accounts up to 250,000 per depositor at each financial institution. Restricted cash balances are uninsured, but are held in separate accounts that are segregated from the general funds of the counterparty. The Company limits uninsured balances to only large, well-known banks and exchange clearing members and believes that it is not exposed to significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents or restricted cash balances. 

The Company records MBS transactions on the trade date. Security purchases that have not settled as of the balance sheet date are included in the MBS balance with an offsetting liability recorded, whereas securities sold that have not settled as of the balance sheet date are removed from the MBS balance with an offsetting receivable recorded. 
 
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability either occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the absence of a principal market, occurs in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Estimated fair values for MBS are based on independent pricing sources and/or third -party broker quotes, when available. 
 
 Income on PT MBS is based on the stated interest rate of the security. Premiums or discounts present at the date of purchase are not amortized. Premium loss and discount accretion resulting from monthly principal repayments are reflected in unrealized gains and losses on MBS in the consolidated statements of operations. For IO securities, the income is accrued based on the carrying value and the effective yield. The difference between income accrued and the interest received on the security is characterized as a return of investment and serves to reduce the asset s carrying value. At each reporting date, the effective yield is adjusted prospectively for future reporting periods based on the new estimate of prepayments and the contractual terms of the security. For IIO securities, effective yield and income recognition calculations also take into account the index value applicable to the security. Changes in fair value of MBS during each reporting period are recorded in earnings and reported as unrealized gains or losses on mortgage-backed securities in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The amount reported as unrealized gains or losses on mortgage-backed securities thus captures the net effect of changes in the fair market value of securities caused by market developments and any premium or discount lost as a result of principal repayments during the period. Realized gains and losses on sales of MBS, using the specific identification method, are reported as a separate component of net portfolio income on the statement of operations. 
 
 million and million on these instruments during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and gains of approximately million and million during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Derivative instruments are carried at fair value, and changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated operations for each period. The Company s derivative financial instruments are not designated as hedge accounting relationships, but rather are used as economic hedges of its portfolio assets and liabilities. Gains and losses on derivatives, except those that result in cash receipts or payments, are included in operating activities on the statements of cash flows. Cash payments and cash receipts from settlement of derivatives, including current period net cash settlements on interest rate swaps, are classified as an investing activity on the statements of cash flows. The Company's derivative agreements generally contain provisions that allow for netting or setting off derivative assets and liabilities with the counterparty; however, related assets and liabilities are reported on a gross basis in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Derivative instruments in a gain position, if any, are reported as derivative assets at fair value and derivative instruments in a loss position, if any, are reported as derivative liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. 

Holding derivatives creates exposure to credit risk related to the potential for failure by counterparties to honor their commitments. In the event of default by a counterparty, the Company may have difficulty recovering its collateral and may not receive payments provided for under the terms of the agreement. The Company s derivative agreements require it to post or receive collateral to mitigate such risk. In addition, the Company uses only registered central clearing exchanges and well-established commercial banks as counterparties, monitors positions with individual counterparties and adjusts posted collateral as required. The Company s futures contracts are exchange traded contracts that are valued based on exchange pricing with daily margin requirements. The margin requirement varies based on the market value of the open position and the equity retained in the account. Margin posted is treated as settlement of the outstanding value of the futures contract. Any margin excess or deficit outstanding is recorded as a receivable or payable as of the date of the Company s balance sheets. The Company realizes gains and losses on these contracts upon expiration equal to the difference between the current fair value of the underlying asset and the contractual price of the futures contract. 
 
 years, office furniture and equipment with depreciable lives of to years, land which has no depreciable life, and our building and its improvements with depreciable lives of years. Property and equipment is recorded at acquisition cost and depreciated to their respective salvage values using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation is included in administrative and other expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. 

The Company assesses the likelihood, based on their technical merit, that uncertain tax positions will be sustained during a tax examination based on the facts, circumstances and information available. The measurement of uncertain tax positions is adjusted when new information is available, or when an event occurs that requires a change. The Company recognizes tax positions in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit and is recorded as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has recorded no such liabilities. The Company records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within the income tax provision.

 One- twelfth of of Orchid s month-end equity that is greater than 250 million and less than or equal to 500 million, and 
 
 One- twelfth of of Orchid s month-end equity that is greater than 500 million. 

The Company also provides certain repurchase agreement trading, clearing and administrative services to Orchid. In consideration for such services, Orchid pays the following fees to the Company: 
 
 a daily fee equal to the outstanding principal balance of repurchase agreement funding in place as of the end of such day multiplied by basis points for the amount of aggregate outstanding principal balance less than or equal to 5 billion, and multiplied by basis point for any amount of aggregate outstanding principal balance in excess of 5 billion, and 
 
 a fee for the clearing and operational services provided by personnel of the Manager equal to per month. 

Orchid is obligated to reimburse Bimini Advisors for any direct expenses incurred on its behalf and to pay to Bimini Advisors an amount equal to Orchid's pro rata portion of certain overhead costs set forth in the management agreement. Orchid is required to pay Bimini Advisors by the 15th day of the month following the month the services are performed. The management agreement has been renewed through February 20, 2025 and provides for automatic one -year extension options thereafter. Should Orchid terminate the management agreement without cause, it will be obligated to pay Bimini Advisors a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee, as defined in the management agreement, before or on the last day of the applicable renewal term.

In addition, cash pledged to counterparties for repurchase agreements was approximately million as of September 30, 2024 . There was cash pledged to counterparties for repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 If, during the term of a repurchase agreement, a lender files for bankruptcy, the Company might experience difficulty recovering its pledged assets, which could result in an unsecured claim against the lender for the difference between the amount loaned to the Company plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral pledged to such lender, including the accrued interest receivable, and cash posted by the Company as collateral, if any. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had an aggregate amount at risk (the difference between the amount loaned to the Company, including interest payable, and the fair value of securities and any cash pledged, including accrued interest on such securities) with all counterparties of approximately million and million, respectively. Summary information regarding amounts at risk with individual counterparties greater than 10 of the Company's stockholders' equity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is presented in the table below.

The authorization for the 2024 Repurchase Plan can be terminated, increased or decreased by the Company s Board of Directors in its discretion at any time. The Company has not repurchased any shares under the 2024 Repurchase Plan. 
 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included a provision for an excise tax equal to 1 of the fair market value of any stock repurchased by covered corporations during a taxable year, subject to certain limits and provisions, including a 1 million threshold before the tax becomes applicable. The excise tax is effective beginning in 2023. The amount of stock repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were under the 1 million threshold, so no excise tax was due.

million and ) million, respectively, on consolidated pre-tax book income of million and million, respectively. The total income tax provision (benefit) recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and ) million, respectively, on consolidated pre-tax book income (loss) of million and ) million, respectively. The Company uses the discrete-period computation method for determining its income tax provision. The Company's income tax provision could be affected by numerous factors, including nondeductible expenses, the projected utilization of net operating loss carryovers and changes in its deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuations. The Company s tax provisions are based on estimated annual tax rates applied to actual income to date and include the expected realization of a portion of the tax benefits of federal and state net operating losses carryforwards NOLs ). In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future accounting periods. The ultimate realization of capital loss and NOL carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future capital gains and taxable income in periods prior to their expiration. The Company currently provides a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets generated by the NOLs since the Company believes that it is more likely than not that some of the benefits will not be realized in the future. The Company will continue to assess the need for, and the amount of, the valuation allowance at each reporting date.

Level 2 valuations, where the valuation is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market, and 

Level 3 valuations, where the valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on Company-specific data. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company s own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability. 

The Company's MBS and Orchid common stock are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. When determining fair value measurements, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset. When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets. When identical assets are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets. 
 
 The Company's MBS are valued using Level 2 valuations, and such valuations currently are determined by the Company based on independent pricing sources and/or third -party broker quotes. Because the price estimates may vary, the Company must make certain judgments and assumptions about the appropriate price to use to calculate the fair values. The Company and the independent pricing sources use various valuation techniques to determine the price of the Company s securities. These techniques include observing the most recent market for like or identical assets (including security coupon, maturity, yield, and prepayment speeds), spread pricing techniques to determine market credit spreads (option adjusted spread, zero volatility spread, spread to the U.S. Treasury curve or spread to a benchmark such as a TBA security), and model driven approaches (the discounted cash flow method, Black Scholes and SABR models which rely upon observable market rates such as the term structure of interest rates and volatility). The appropriate spread pricing method used is based on market convention. The pricing source determines the spread of recently observed trade activity or observable markets for assets similar to those being priced. The spread is then adjusted based on variances in certain characteristics between the market observation and the asset being priced. Those characteristics include: type of asset, the expected life of the asset, the stability and predictability of the expected future cash flows of the asset, whether the coupon of the asset is fixed or adjustable, the guarantor of the security if applicable, the coupon, the maturity, the issuer, size of the underlying loans, year in which the underlying loans were originated, loan to value ratio, state in which the underlying loans reside, credit score of the underlying borrowers and other variables if appropriate. The fair value of the security is determined by using the adjusted spread. 
 
 The Company s futures contracts are Level 1 valuations, as they are exchange-traded instruments and quoted market prices are readily available. Futures contracts are settled daily. 
 
 The estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accrued interest receivable, other assets, due from affiliates, repurchase agreements, accrued interest payable and other liabilities generally approximates their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. The Company estimates the fair value of the cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash using Level 1 inputs, and the accrued interest receivable, other assets, due from affiliates, repurchase agreements, accrued interest payable and other liabilities using Level 2 inputs. The fair value of the Company s junior subordinated debt approximates its carrying value. The carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value since the instrument carries a floating rate that resets frequently. Further information regarding this instrument is presented in Note 7.

 Overview 
 
 Bimini Capital Management, Inc. ("Bimini Capital" or the "Company") is a holding company that was formed in September 2003. The Company s principal wholly-owned operating subsidiary is Royal Palm Capital, LLC. We operate in two business segments: the asset management segment, which includes (a) the investment advisory services provided by Royal Palm s wholly-owned subsidiary, Bimini Advisors Holdings, LLC, to Orchid Island Capital, Inc. ("Orchid") and to Royal Palm, and (b) the investment portfolio segment, which includes the investment activities conducted by Royal Palm. 
 
 Royal Palm Capital, LLC (collectively with its wholly-owned subsidiaries referred to as Royal Palm maintains an investment portfolio, consisting primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") issued and guaranteed by a federally chartered corporation or agency ("Agency MBS"). We also invest in the common stock of Orchid. Our investment strategy focuses on, and our portfolio consists of, two categories of Agency MBS: (i) traditional pass-through Agency MBS, such as mortgage pass-through certificates issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae (the GSEs and collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs issued by the GSEs PT MBS and (ii) structured Agency MBS, such as interest only securities ("IOs"), inverse interest only securities ("IIOs") and principal only securities ("POs"), among other types of structured Agency MBS. In addition, Royal Palm receives dividends from its investment in Orchid common shares. 
 
 Bimini Advisors Holdings, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bimini Advisors, LLC (an investment advisor registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission), are collectively referred to as Bimini Advisors. Bimini Advisors serves as the external manager of the portfolio of Orchid. From this arrangement, the Company receives management fees and expense reimbursements. As manager, Bimini Advisors is responsible for administering Orchid's business activities and day-to-day operations and providing certain repurchase agreement trading, clearing and administrative services. Pursuant to the terms of the management agreement, Bimini Advisors provides Orchid with its management team, including its officers, along with appropriate support personnel. Bimini Advisors is at all times subject to the supervision and oversight of Orchid's board of directors and has only such functions and authority as delegated to it. 
 
 Stock Repurchase Plan 
 
 On September 16, 2021, the Board authorized a share repurchase plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 2021 Repurchase Plan ). Pursuant to the 2021 Repurchase Plan, the Company could purchase shares of its Class A Common Stock from time to time for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed 2.5 million. Share repurchases could be executed through various means, including, without limitation, open market transactions. From the commencement of the 2021 Repurchase Plan, through its expiration on September 16, 2023, the Company repurchased a total of 789,024 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately 1.3 million, including commissions and fees, for a weighted average price of 1.60 per share. 
 
 On March 7, 2024, the Board authorized a share repurchase plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "2024 Repurchase Plan"). Pursuant to the 2024 Repurchase Plan, we can purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock from time to time for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed 2.5 million. Share repurchases can be executed through various means, including, without limitation, open market transactions. The 2024 Repurchase Plan does not obligate the Company to purchase any shares and expires on March 7, 2026. There have been no repurchases in 2024. 
 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the "Act"), includes a provision for an excise tax equal to 1 of the fair market value of any stock repurchased by covered corporations during a taxable year, subject to certain limits and other provisions. The excise tax was effective beginning in 2023. The Company was not subject to the tax in 2023, as its repurchases were less than the threshold specified in the Act. While we may complete transactions subject to the new excise tax, we do not expect this tax to have a material impact to our financial condition or result of operations.

GAAP and Non-GAAP Reconciliation 
 
 Economic Interest Expense and Economic Net Interest Income 
 
 We use derivative instruments, primarily U.S. Treasury Note T-Note and SOFR futures contracts to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk on repurchase agreements in a rising rate environment. 
 
 We have not designated our derivative financial instruments as hedge accounting relationships, but rather hold them for economic hedging purposes. Changes in fair value of these instruments are presented in a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations and not included in interest expense. As such, for financial reporting purposes, interest expense and cost of funds are not impacted by the fluctuation in value of the derivative instruments. 
 
 For the purpose of computing economic net interest income and ratios relating to cost of funds measures, GAAP interest expense, as reflected in our consolidated statements of operations, is adjusted to reflect the realized and unrealized gains or losses on certain derivative instruments the Company uses that pertain to each period presented. We believe that adjusting our GAAP interest expense for the periods presented by the gains or losses on these derivative instruments may not accurately reflect our economic interest expense for these periods. The reason is that these derivative instruments may cover periods that extend into the future, not just the current period. Any realized or unrealized gains or losses on the derivative instruments reflect the change in market value of the instrument caused by changes in underlying interest rates applicable to the term covered by the instrument, which changes are reflective of the future periods covered by the derivative instrument, not just the current period. 
 
 For each period presented, we have combined the effects of the derivative financial instruments in place for the respective period with the actual interest expense incurred on repurchase agreements to reflect total economic interest expense for the applicable period. Interest expense, including the effect of derivative instruments for the period, is referred to as economic interest expense. Net interest income, when calculated to include the effect of derivative instruments for the period, is referred to as economic net interest income. This presentation includes gains or losses on all contracts in effect during the reporting period, covering the current period as well as periods in the future. 
 
 We believe that economic interest expense and economic net interest income provide meaningful information to consider, in addition to the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures help management to evaluate its financial position and performance without the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that are not necessarily indicative of our current investment portfolio or operations. The gains or losses on derivative instruments presented in our consolidated statements of operations are not necessarily representative of the total interest expense that we will ultimately realize. This is because as interest rates move up or down in the future, the gains or losses we ultimately realize, and which will affect our total interest expense in future periods, may differ from the unrealized gains or losses recognized as of the reporting date.

Table of Contents 

Our presentation of the economic value of our hedging strategy has important limitations. First, other market participants may calculate economic interest expense and economic net interest income differently than the way we calculate them. Second, while we believe that the calculation of the economic value of our hedging strategy described above helps to present our financial position and performance, it may be of limited usefulness as an analytical tool. Therefore, the economic value of our investment strategy should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for interest expense and net interest income computed in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 The tables below present a reconciliation of the adjustments discussed above to interest expense shown for each period relative to our derivative instruments, and the consolidated statements of operations line item, gains (losses) on derivative instruments, calculated in accordance with GAAP for each quarter in 2024 and 2023.

 Advisory Services Revenue 
 
 Advisory services revenue consists of management fees and overhead reimbursements charged to Orchid for the management of its portfolio pursuant to the terms of a management agreement. We receive a monthly management fee in the amount of: 

One-twelfth of 1.50 of the first 250 million of Orchid s month-end equity, as defined in the management agreement, 

One-twelfth of 1.25 of Orchid s month-end equity that is greater than 250 million and less than or equal to 500 million, and 

One-twelfth of 1.00 of Orchid s month-end equity that is greater than 500 million.

Table of Contents 

The Company also provides certain repurchase agreement trading, clearing and administrative services to Orchid. In consideration for such services, Orchid pays the following fees to the Company: 

a daily fee equal to the outstanding principal balance of repurchase agreement funding in place as of the end of such day multiplied by 1.5 basis points for the amount of aggregate outstanding principal balance less than or equal to 5 billion, and multiplied by 1.0 basis point for any amount of aggregate outstanding principal balance in excess of 5 billion, and 

a fee for the clearing and operational services provided by personnel of the Manager equal to 10,000 per month. 

In addition, Orchid is obligated to reimburse us for any direct expenses incurred on its behalf and to pay to us an amount equal to Orchid's pro rata portion of certain overhead costs set forth in the management agreement. The management agreement has been renewed through February 2025 and provides for automatic one-year extension options. Should Orchid terminate the management agreement without cause, it will be obligated to pay to us a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee, as defined in the management agreement, before or on the last day of the applicable renewal term.

Investment Portfolio Segment 
 
 Net Portfolio Interest Income (Expense) 
 
 We define net portfolio interest income as interest income on MBS less interest expense on repurchase agreement funding. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 428,000 of net portfolio interest income, consisting of 4.2 million of interest income from MBS assets offset by 3.7 million of interest expense on repurchase liabilities. For the comparable period ended September 30, 2023, we generated 59,000 of net portfolio interest income, consisting of 2.0 million of interest income from MBS assets offset by 1.9 million of interest expense on repurchase liabilities. The 2.2 million increase in interest income was due to a 145 basis point ("bp") increase in yields, combined with an 35.3 million increase in average MBS holdings. There was a 1.8 million increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that was due to a 102 bp increase in cost of funds, combined with a 33.7 million increase in average repurchase liabilities. 
 
 Our economic interest expense on repurchase liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3.7 million and 2.0 million, respectively, resulting in 457,000 and (3,000) of economic net portfolio interest income (expense), respectively. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 112,000 of net portfolio interest income, consisting of 1.5 million of interest income from MBS assets offset by 1.4 million of interest expense on repurchase liabilities. For the comparable period ended September 30, 2023, we generated 7,000 of net portfolio interest income, consisting of 838,000 of interest income from MBS assets offset by 831,000 of interest expense on repurchase liabilities. The 647,000 increase in interest income was due to a 129 bp increase in yields, combined with an 28.1 million increase in average MBS holdings. There was a 542,000 increase in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 that was due to a 93 bp increase in cost of funds, combined with a 26.9 million increase in average repurchase liabilities.

Cost of Funds 
 
 Since all of our repurchase agreements are short-term, changes in market rates have a more immediate impact on our interest expense. Our average cost of funds calculated on a GAAP basis was 45 bps above the average one-month SOFR and 24 bps above the average six-month SOFR for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Our average economic cost of funds was 59 bps below the average one-month SOFR and 38 bps below the average six-month SOFR for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The average term to maturity of the outstanding repurchase agreements was 24 days at September 30, 2024, compared to 29 days at December 31, 2023. The tables below present the average outstanding balances under our repurchase agreements, interest expense and average economic cost of funds, and average one-month and six-month SOFR rates for each quarter in 2024 and 2023, on both a GAAP and economic basis.

Dividend Income from Orchid 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we owned 569,071 shares of Orchid common stock, respectively. Orchid paid total dividends of 1.08 and 1.44 per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in dividend income on this common stock investment of approximately 0.6 million and 0.8 million, respectively. Orchid paid total dividends of 0.36 and 0.48 per share during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in dividend income on this common stock investment of approximately 0.2 million and 0.3 million, respectively. 
 
 Long-Term Debt 
 
 Junior Subordinated Debt 
 
 Prior to June 30, 2023, the junior subordinated debt securities paid interest at a floating rate, adjusted quarterly and set at a spread of 3.50 over the prevailing three-month LIBOR rate on the determination date. Starting June 30, 2023, the underlying index converted from three-month LIBOR to CME Term SOFR plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161 . The interest rate for subsequent accrual periods will be CME Term SOFR on the applicable reset date plus the tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161 plus the coupon spread of 3.50 . The CME Term SOFR index is in effect for all interest rate resets after July 3, 2023. The LIBOR and CME Term SOFR rate increases since January 2022 have increased our interest expense. Interest expense on our junior subordinated debt securities was 1.8 million and 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average rate of interest paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.09 compared to 8.62 for the comparable period in 2023. Interest expense on our junior subordinated debt securities was 0.6 million and 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

We invest in MBS with the intent to earn net income from the realized yield on those assets over their related funding and hedging costs, and not for the purpose of making short term gains from trading in these securities. However, we have sold, and may continue to sell, existing assets to acquire new assets, which our management believes might have higher risk-adjusted returns in light of current or anticipated interest rates, federal government programs or general economic conditions or to manage our balance sheet as part of our asset/liability management strategy. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received proceeds of 46.3 million from the sales of RMBS. We did not sell any MBS during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The fair value of our MBS portfolio and derivative instruments, and the gains (losses) reported on those financial instruments, are driven in part by changes in yields and interest rates, the spreads that MBS trade relative to comparable duration U.S. Treasuries or swaps, as well as varying levels of demand for MBS, which affect the pricing of the securities in our portfolio. The unrealized gains and losses on MBS may also include the premium lost as a result of prepayments on the underlying mortgages, decreasing unrealized gains or increasing unrealized losses as prepayment speeds or premiums increase. To the extent MBS are carried at a discount to par, unrealized gains or losses on MBS would also include discount accreted as a result of prepayments on the underlying mortgages, increasing unrealized gains or decreasing unrealized losses as speeds on discounts increase. Gains and losses on interest rate futures contracts are affected by changes in implied forward rates during the reporting period.

Income Tax Provision 
 
 We recorded an income tax provision (benefit) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of approximately 1.1 million and (0.3) million, respectively, on consolidated pre-tax book income of 1.2 million and 0.6 million, respectively. The total income tax provision (benefit) recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.5 million and (0.8) million, respectively, on consolidated pre-tax book (loss) income of 0.8 million and (1.2) million, respectively. The Company uses the discrete-period computation method for determining its income tax (benefit) provision. Our income tax provision could be affected by numerous factors, including non-deductible expenses, the projected utilization of net operating loss carryovers and changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuations, and can result in significant variations in the customary relationship between pretax income and income tax expense. The increase in the income tax provision relative to the pre-tax book income (loss) for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in executive compensation subject to Section 162(m) limitations. 
 
 Financial Condition: 
 
 Mortgage-Backed Securities 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our MBS portfolio consisted of 118.4 million of agency or government MBS at fair value and had a weighted average coupon of 5.24 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received principal repayments of 10.1 million compared to 3.3 million for the comparable period ended September 30, 2023. The average prepayment speeds for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 6.3 and 4.8 , respectively. 
 
 The following table presents the three-month constant prepayment rate CPR experienced on our structured and PT MBS sub-portfolios, on an annualized basis, for the quarterly periods presented. CPR is a method of expressing the prepayment rate for a mortgage pool that assumes that a constant fraction of the remaining principal is prepaid each month or year. Specifically, the CPR in the chart below represents the three-month prepayment rate of the securities in the respective asset category.

Effective Duration (1) 

2.627 

2.508 

(1) 
 Effective duration is the approximate percentage change in price for a 100 basis point change in rates. An effective duration of 2.627 indicates that an interest rate increase of 1.0 would be expected to cause a 2.627 decrease in the value of the MBS in our investment portfolio at September 30, 2024. An effective duration of 2.508 indicates that an interest rate increase of 1.0 would be expected to cause a 2.508 decrease in the value of the MBS in our investment portfolio at December 31, 2023. These figures include the structured securities in the portfolio but do include the effect of our hedges. Effective duration quotes for individual investments are obtained from The Yield Book, Inc. 

Our portfolio of PT MBS is typically comprised of adjustable-rate MBS, fixed-rate MBS and hybrid adjustable-rate MBS. We generally seek to acquire low duration assets that offer high levels of protection from mortgage prepayments provided that they are reasonably priced by the market. The stated contractual final maturity of the mortgage loans underlying our portfolio of PT MBS generally ranges up to 30 years. However, the effect of prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans tends to shorten the resulting cash flows from our investments substantially. Prepayments occur for various reasons, including refinancing of underlying mortgages, loan payoffs in connection with home sales, and borrowers paying more than their scheduled loan payments, which accelerates the amortization of the loans. 
 
 The duration of our IO and IIO portfolio will vary greatly depending on the structural features of the securities. While prepayment activity will always affect the cash flows associated with the securities, the interest only nature of IO s may cause their durations to become extremely negative when prepayments are high, and less negative when prepayments are low. Prepayments affect the duration of IIO s similarly, but the floating rate nature of the coupon of IIOs (which has inverse relationship to their reference index) causes their price movements - and model duration - to be affected by changes in both prepayments and their reference index - both current and anticipated levels. As a result, the duration of IIO securities will also vary greatly. 
 
 Prepayments on the loans underlying our MBS can alter the timing of the cash flows received by us. As a result, we gauge the interest rate sensitivity of its assets by measuring their effective duration. While modified duration measures the price sensitivity of a bond to movements in interest rates, effective duration captures both the movement in interest rates and the fact that cash flows to a mortgage related security are altered when interest rates move. Accordingly, when the contract interest rate on a mortgage loan is substantially above prevailing interest rates in the market, the effective duration of securities collateralized by such loans can be quite low because of expected prepayments. 
 
 We face the risk that the market value of our PT MBS assets will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our structured MBS or liabilities, including our hedging instruments. Accordingly, we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities. We generally calculate duration and effective duration using various third-party models or obtain these quotes from third parties. However, empirical results and various third-party models may produce different duration numbers for the same securities. 
 
 The following sensitivity analysis shows the estimated impact on the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive investments and hedge positions as of September 30, 2024, assuming rates instantaneously fall 100 bps, rise 100 bps and rise 200 bps, adjusted to reflect the impact of convexity, which is the measure of the sensitivity of our hedge positions and Agency MBS effective duration to movements in interest rates.

In addition to changes in interest rates, other factors impact the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive investments and hedging instruments, such as the shape of the yield curve, market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions. Accordingly, in the event of changes in actual interest rates, the change in the fair value of our assets would likely differ from that shown above and such difference might be material and adverse to our stockholders. 
 
 Repurchase Agreements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had established borrowing facilities in the repurchase agreement market with a number of commercial banks and other financial institutions and had borrowings in place with six of these counterparties. We believe these facilities provide borrowing capacity in excess of our needs. None of these lenders are affiliated with us. These borrowings are secured by our MBS. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had obligations outstanding under the repurchase agreements of approximately 113.0 million with a net weighted average borrowing cost of 5.20 . The remaining maturity of our outstanding repurchase agreement obligations ranged from 15 to 46 days, with a weighted average maturity of 24 days. Securing the repurchase agreement obligation as of September 30, 2024 are MBS with an estimated fair value, including accrued interest, of 118.8 million. Through October 31, 2024, we have been able to maintain our repurchase facilities with comparable terms to those that existed at September 30, 2024 with maturities through January 24, 2025.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity is our ability to turn non-cash assets into cash to fund our operations and to meet our obligations in both the short-term (one year or less) and long-term (greater than one year). Our material cash requirements include the purchase of additional investments, repay principal and interest on repurchase agreements and long-term debt (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the timing of principal payments and maturities of our long-term debt.), fund overhead and fulfill margin calls. We have both internal and external sources of liquidity. However, our material unused sources of liquidity include cash balances, unencumbered assets and our ability to sell encumbered assets to raise cash. Our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on-going basis through payments of principal and interest we receive on our MBS portfolio and dividends we receive on our investment in Orchid common stock. 

- 33 -

Table of Contents 

Internal Sources of Liquidity 
 
 Our internal sources of liquidity include our cash balances, unencumbered assets and our ability to liquidate our encumbered security holdings. Our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an ongoing basis through payments of principal and interest we receive on our MBS portfolio and dividends we receive on our investment in Orchid common stock. 
 
 We employ a hedging strategy that typically involves taking short positions in T-Note and SOFR futures, TBAs or other instruments. When the market causes these short positions to decline in value we are required to meet margin calls with cash. This can reduce our liquidity position to the extent other securities in our portfolio move in price in such a way that we do not receive enough cash through margin calls to offset the futures or TBA short positions related margin calls. If this were to occur in sufficient magnitude, the loss of liquidity might force us to reduce the size of the levered portfolio, pledge additional structured securities to raise funds or risk operating the portfolio with less liquidity. 
 
 External Sources of Liquidity 
 
 Our primary external sources of liquidity are our ability to (i) borrow under master repurchase agreements and (ii) use the TBA security market. Our borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of our interest earning assets varies. Our master repurchase agreements have no stated expiration, but can be terminated at any time at our option or at the option of the counterparty. However, once a definitive repurchase agreement under a master repurchase agreement has been entered into, it generally may not be terminated by either party. A negotiated termination can occur, but may involve a fee to be paid by the party seeking to terminate the repurchase agreement transaction. 
 
 Under our repurchase agreement funding arrangements, we are required to post margin at the initiation of the borrowing. The margin posted represents the haircut, which is a percentage of the market value of the collateral pledged. To the extent the market value of the asset collateralizing the financing transaction declines, the market value of our posted margin will be insufficient and we will be required to post additional collateral. Conversely, if the market value of the asset pledged increases in value, we would be over collateralized and we would be entitled to have excess margin returned to us by the counterparty. Our lenders typically value our pledged securities daily to ensure the adequacy of our margin and make margin calls as needed, as do we. Typically, but not always, the parties agree to a minimum threshold amount for margin calls so as to avoid the need for nuisance margin calls on a daily basis. Our master repurchase agreements do not specify the haircut; rather haircuts are determined on an individual repo transaction basis. 
 
 We invest a portion of our capital in structured MBS. We generally do not apply leverage to this portion of our portfolio. The leverage inherent in structured securities replaces the leverage obtained by acquiring PT securities and funding them in the repo market. This structured MBS strategy has been a core element of the Company s overall investment strategy since 2008. However, we have and may continue to pledge a portion of our structured MBS in order to raise our cash levels, but generally will not pledge these securities in order to acquire additional assets. 
 
 In future periods we expect to continue to finance our activities through repurchase agreements and through revenues from our advisory services business. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 4.6 million. We generated cash flows of 14.0 million from principal and interest payments on our MBS portfolio and had average repurchase agreements outstanding of 89.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received approximately 9.4 million in management fees and expense reimbursements as manager of Orchid and approximately 0.6 million in dividends from our investment in Orchid common stock. 
 
 Outlook 
 
 Orchid Island Capital Inc. 
 
 Orchid Island Capital reported net income for the third quarter 2024 of 17.4 million and its shareholders equity increased from 555.9 million to 656.0 million. Orchid is obligated to reimburse us for direct expenses paid on its behalf and to pay to us Orchid s pro rata share of overhead as defined in the management agreement. As a stockholder of Orchid, we will also continue to share in distributions, if any, paid by Orchid to its stockholders. Our operating results are also impacted by changes in the market value of our holdings of Orchid common shares, although these market value changes do not impact our cash flows from Orchid.

Economic Summary 
 
 The trajectory of the economy that existed as the second quarter of 2024 ended continued into the third quarter. The trend was apparent in the incoming economic data, the level of interest rates and the outlook for monetary policy on the part of the Fed. With respect to the latter, the Fed finally lowered the Fed Funds rate in late September by 50 basis points, the first interest rate cut since the Fed stopped tightening monetary policy in March of 2023. The move was well telegraphed by various Fed officials during their public comments leading up to the event, as the Fed was careful not to surprise the market with the cut. Throughout the third quarter, incoming labor market and inflation data was consistent with the Fed s view that inflation was approaching its 2 target and would soon get there. The Fed s focus has shifted to the labor market and ensuring the supply/demand balance that had led to a low unemployment rate and outsized wage gains did not slow too much and jeopardize its efforts to fulfill its second mandate of full employment. Further, elevated interest rate levels had materially impacted the housing market and other interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, so the Fed feared that if the labor market cooled too much then economic growth could as well. The manufacturing side of the economy was already weak, so all things considered the Fed s movement of monetary policy back towards the neutral rate appears to be consistent with its mandates. 
 
 Unlike the inflation and labor market data, consumer spending levels and economic growth generally as measured by GDP were still quite robust during the third quarter and, in the case of the latter, trending at or above sustainable trend growth rates. However, as long as inflation data continued to move towards its target level and such data was already there when three- or six-month measures were annualized the Fed appeared comfortable lowering the Fed Funds rate to ensure the labor market did not cool too much. As the fourth quarter of 2024 begins, the latest reading on the labor market appears to have reversed the slowing trend apparent over the last several months as the September reading was very strong, previous months data was revised higher and the unemployment rate declined. Also, in late September, the government revised previously released data on gross domestic income GDI ), another measure of economic growth. GDI data over the past several quarters had been quite low and inconsistent with GDP data and consumer spending levels. Most economists believed the GDI data painted the more accurate picture of the true level of economic growth in the economy. However, the GDI data was revised higher and was now consistent with the GDP data. Together with the latest labor market data, the economy now appears quite healthy and the market expects that the Fed will be more conservative in the timing and extent of further reductions in the Fed Funds rate. 
 
 Interest Rates 
 
 Over the course of the third quarter of 2024, interest rates continued to decrease as they had through the last two months of the second quarter. After the yield on the 10-year T-Note peaked at 4.7 in late April 2024, the yield trended downward until hitting a year-to-date low near 3.6 on September 16, 2024. However, the GDI revisions in late September, coupled with the resurgence in the labor market data released in early October, drove 10-year U.S. Treasury rates back above 4 in early October. Otherwise, the U.S Treasury and swap curves steepened throughout the third quarter of 2024. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year T-Notes turned positive in early September 2024 for the first time since mid-2022, ending the longest period of inversion ever recorded. 
 
 As noted above, the Fed reduced the overnight Fed Funds rate at its meeting in September by 50 basis points. Given developments discussed above that occurred prior to the Fed s meeting in September cooling inflation data, a slowing labor market and comments by Fed officials regarding their desire to start to remove overly restrictive monetary policy the market anticipated two such 50 basis point cuts and at least one additional 25 basis point cut by year-end based on price levels in the futures and related markets. The developments late in the third quarter of 2024 and early in the fourth quarter of 2024 the GDI revisions, September labor market report and even the September inflation report released in early October, which was slightly higher than expectations have reduced market expectations of further Fed Funds rate cuts this year to less than two more 25 basis point cuts. Some economists believe the economy may have achieved a soft landing after the 500+ basis point hikes initiated by the Fed. A soft landing refers to the outcome where the economy does not suffer a contraction or even slowdown growth following a tightening cycle by the Fed. Such instances are very rare, and it remains to be seen if this will prove to be the case. 
 
 Interest rate volatility embedded in interest rate derivatives, as measured by the MOVE index, was elevated throughout the third quarter of 2024 and even increased further still late in the quarter after the Fed Funds rate cut, likely in response to the developments discussed above, geopolitical events in the Middle East and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election in November. The value of the index approached a year-to-date high reading in early October. Given that uncertainty surrounding these same events remains, it is likely interest rate volatility will remain elevated through the fourth quarter of 2024.

The Agency RMBS Market 
 
 Declining interest rates across the maturity spectrum of the treasury curve led all fixed income sectors of the market to generate positive absolute returns for the third quarter of 2024 although excess returns versus comparable duration swaps were far less robust. Agency RMBS absolute returns for the quarter were 4.7 and 4.9 for conventional Agency RMBS the non-GNMA component of the Agency RMBS index. These absolute returns compare to 5.7 for investment grade debt, 5.3 for high yield debt, 4.8 for US treasuries, 4.6 for Agency debt, and 4.5 for Agency CMBS. Excess returns versus comparable duration swaps for the quarter for Agency RBS were 0.7 and 0.9 for the non-GNMA component of the Agency RMBS index. Excess returns for the other major components of the domestic fixed income markets (excluding treasuries) for the third quarter of 2024 were 1.4 for investment grade debt, 0.3 for high yield debt, -0.1 for Agency debt, and 0.2 for Agency CMBS. 
 
 Within the stack of 30-year, fixed rate Agency RMBS (the asset class in which the Company invests the vast majority of its capital), given the decrease in interest rates over the course of the third quarter of 2024 absolute returns tracked the duration of the securities - the higher the duration, the higher the return. The return for 2.0 coupon securities was 6.7 for the second quarter, the highest return, and 2.6 for 7.0 coupon securities, the lowest return and coupon. Within the stack of 30-year, fixed rate Agency RMBS, excess returns versus comparable duration swaps for the third quarter (a proxy for hedged returns) generally followed the same pattern, with lower coupon, longer duration coupons (3 and lower) with excess returns between 1.1 and 1.4 , the highest coupons (6.5 and 7.0 at 0.2 and the intermediate coupons gradually declining as coupons declined. 
 
 Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
 
 In response to the deterioration in the markets for U.S. Treasuries, Agency RMBS and other mortgage and fixed income markets resulting from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed implemented a program of quantitative easing. Through November of 2021, the Fed was committed to purchasing 80 billion of U.S. Treasuries and 40 billion of Agency RMBS each month. In November of 2021, it began tapering its net asset purchases each month, ended net asset purchases by early March of 2022, and ended asset purchases entirely in September of 2022. On May 4, 2022, the FOMC announced a plan for reducing the Fed s balance sheet. In June of 2022, in accordance with this plan, the Fed began reducing its balance sheet by a maximum of 30 billion of U.S. Treasuries and 17.5 billion of Agency RMBS each month. On September 21, 2022, the FOMC announced the Fed s decision to continue reducing its balance sheet by a maximum of 60 billion of U.S. Treasuries and 35 billion of Agency RMBS per month. On May 1, 2024, the FOMC announced the Fed s decision to reduce its balance sheet by a maximum of 25 billion of U.S. Treasuries and remove the cap on Agency RMBS reduction, with any amounts in excess of 35 billion per month being reinvested in U.S. Treasury securities. Relatively high interest rates and slow prepayment speeds have kept the balance sheet reduction for Agency RMBS below 20 billion per month throughout 2024, although an increase in mortgage refinance applications following the announcement of the Fed Funds rate cut in September 2024 may accelerate the process. As of August 2024, the Fed had reduced its balance sheet for Agency RMBS by approximately 440 billion from the peak to 2.3 trillion, shedding approximately 32 of the Agency RMBS added during pandemic quantitative easing and representing the lowest level since June 2021. 
 
 On September 30, 2019, the FHFA announced that Fannie Mae and Feddie Mac were allowed to increase their capital buffers to 25 billion and 20 billion, respectively, from the prior limit of 3 billion each. This step could ultimately lead to the Enterprises being privatized and represents the first concrete step on the road to Enterprise reform. In December 2020, the FHFA released a final rule on a new regulatory framework for the Enterprises which seeks to implement both a risk-based capital framework and minimum leverage capital requirements. On January 14, 2021, the U.S. Treasury and the FHFA executed letter agreements allowing the Enterprises to continue to retain capital up to their regulatory minimums, including buffers, as prescribed in the December rule. These letter agreements provide, in part, (i) there will be no exit from conservatorship until all material litigation is settled and the Enterprise has common equity Tier 1 capital of at least 3 of its assets, (ii) the Enterprises will comply with the FHFA s regulatory capital framework, (iii) higher-risk single-family mortgage acquisitions will be restricted to then current levels, and (iv) the U.S. Treasury and the FHFA will establish a timeline and process for future Enterprise reform. However, no definitive proposals or legislation have been released or enacted with respect to ending the conservatorship, unwinding the Enterprises, or materially reducing the roles of the Enterprises in the U.S. mortgage market.

On September 14, 2021, the U.S. Treasury and the FHFA suspended certain policy provisions in the January agreement, including limits on loans acquired for cash consideration, multifamily loans, loans with higher risk characteristics and second homes and investment properties. On February 25, 2022, the FHFA published a final rule, effective as of April 26, 2022, amending the Enterprise capital framework established in December 2020 by, among other things, replacing the fixed leverage buffer equal to 1.5 of an Enterprise s adjusted total assets with a dynamic leverage buffer equal to 50 of an Enterprise s stability capital buffer, reducing the risk weight floor from 10 to 5 , and removing the requirement that the Enterprises must apply an overall effectiveness adjustment to their credit risk transfer exposures. On June 14, 2022, the Enterprises announced that they would each charge a 50 bps fee for commingled securities issued on or after July 1, 2022 to cover the additional capital required for such securities under the Enterprise capital framework, which was subsequently reduced on January 19, 2023 to 9.375 bps for commingled securities issued on or after April 1, 2023 to address industry concern that the fee posed a risk to the fungibility of the Uniform Mortgage-Backed Security UMBS and negatively impacted liquidity and pricing in the market for TBA securities. On November 30, 2023, the FHFA published a final rule, which became effective April 1, 2024, which will, among other things, reduce the risk weight and credit conversion factor for guarantees on commingled securities to 5 and 50 , respectively; replace the current exposure methodology with the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk as the method for computing exposure and risk-weighted asset amounts for derivatives and cleared transactions; update the credit score assumption to 680 for single-family mortgage exposures originated without a representative credit score; and introduce a risk weight of 20 for guarantee assets. 
 
 On July 27, 2023, the federal banking regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, (the "OCC") the FDIC and the Fed, jointly issued a proposed rule that would revise large bank capital requirements (the "Basel III Endgame"). The Basel III Endgame, if implemented as proposed, would significantly increase the credit weight risk for balance-sheet mortgages and for Agency RMBS sold to the GSEs, which could disincentivize banks from originating mortgages for sale to the GSEs and impact pricing in the Agency RMBS markets. The comment period for the Basel III Endgame closed on January 16, 2024, and the proposed rule was met with strong objections from the banking industry. In testimony before the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs in July 2024, Fed chairman Jerome Powell stated that the OCC, the FDIC and the Fed were in discussions to materially revise the proposed rule, and that there was consensus at the Fed to undergo another comment period. In remarks given on September 10, 2024, Michael Barr, the Fed's Vice Chair for Supervision, confirmed that the Basel III Endgame was being rewritten to, among other things, reduce the risk weights for residential real estate and retail exposures, extend the scope of the reduced risk weight for certain low-risk corporate debt, and eliminate the minimum haircut for securities financing transactions. 
 
 The scope and nature of the actions the U.S. government or the Fed will ultimately undertake are unknown and will continue to evolve. 
 
 Effect on Us 
 
 Regulatory developments, movements in interest rates and prepayment rates affect us in many ways, including the following: 
 
 Effects on our Assets 
 
 A change in or elimination of the guarantee structure of Agency RMBS may increase our costs (if, for example, guarantee fees increase) or require us to change our investment strategy altogether. For example, the elimination of the guarantee structure of Agency RMBS may cause us to change our investment strategy to focus on non-Agency RMBS, which in turn would require us to significantly increase our monitoring of the credit risks of our investments in addition to interest rate and prepayment risks. 
 
 If prepayment rates are relatively low (due, in part, to the refinancing problems described above), lower long-term interest rates can increase the value of our Agency RMBS. This is because investors typically place a premium on assets with coupon/yields that are higher than coupon/yields available in the market. To the extent such securities pre-pay slower than would otherwise be the case, we benefit from an above market coupon/yield for longer, enhancing the return from the security. Although lower long-term interest rates may increase asset values in our portfolio, we may not be able to invest new funds in similarly yielding assets. 

- 37 -

Table of Contents 

If prepayment levels increase, the value of any of our Agency RMBS that are carried at a premium to par that are affected by such prepayments may decline. This is because a principal prepayment accelerates the effective term of an Agency RMBS, which would shorten the period during which an investor would receive above-market returns (assuming the yield on the prepaid asset is higher than market yields). Also, prepayment proceeds may not be able to be reinvested in similar-yielding assets. Agency RMBS backed by mortgages with high interest rates are more susceptible to prepayment risk because holders of those mortgages are most likely to refinance to a lower rate. If prepayment levels decrease, the value of any of our Agency RMBS that are carried at a discount to par that are affected by such prepayments may increase. This is because a principal prepayment accelerates the effective term of an Agency RMBS, which would shorten the timeframe over which an investor would receive the principal of the underlying loans. Agency RMBS backed by mortgages with low interest rates are less susceptible to prepayment risk because holders of those mortgages are less likely to refinance to a higher rate. IOs and IIOs, however, may be the types of Agency RMBS most sensitive to increased prepayment rates. Because the holder of an IO or IIO receives no principal payments, the values of IOs and IIOs are entirely dependent on the existence of a principal balance on the underlying mortgages. If the principal balance is eliminated due to prepayment, IOs and IIOs essentially become worthless. Although increased prepayment rates can negatively affect the value of our IOs and IIOs, they have the opposite effect on POs. Because POs act like zero-coupon bonds, meaning they are purchased at a discount to their par value and have an effective interest rate based on the discount and the term of the underlying loan, an increase in prepayment rates would reduce the effective term of our POs and accelerate the yields earned on those assets, which would increase our net income. 
 
 Higher long-term rates can also affect the value of our Agency RMBS. As long-term rates rise, rates available to borrowers also rise. This tends to cause prepayment activity to slow and extend the expected average life of mortgage cash flows. As the expected average life of the mortgage cash flows increases, coupled with higher discount rates, the value of Agency RMBS declines. Some of the instruments we use to hedge our Agency RMBS assets, such as interest rate futures, swaps and swaptions, are stable average life instruments. This means that to the extent we use such instruments to hedge our Agency RMBS assets, our hedges may not adequately protect us from price declines, and therefore may negatively impact our book value. It is for this reason we use interest only securities in our portfolio. As interest rates rise, the expected average life of these securities increases, causing generally positive price movements as the number and size of the cash flows increase the longer the underlying mortgages remain outstanding. This makes interest only securities desirable hedge instruments for pass-through Agency RMBS. 
 
 Because we base our investment decisions on risk management principles rather than anticipated movements in interest rates, in a volatile interest rate environment we may allocate more capital to structured Agency RMBS with shorter durations. We believe these securities have a lower sensitivity to changes in long-term interest rates than other asset classes. We may attempt to mitigate our exposure to changes in long-term interest rates by investing in IOs and IIOs, which typically have different sensitivities to changes in long-term interest rates than PT RMBS, particularly PT RMBS backed by fixed-rate mortgages. 
 
 Effects on our borrowing costs 
 
 We leverage our PT RMBS portfolio and a portion of our structured Agency RMBS with principal balances through the use of short-term repurchase agreement transactions. The interest rates on our debt are determined by the short-term interest rate markets. Increases in the Fed Funds rate or SOFR typically increase our borrowing costs, which could affect our interest rate spread if there is no corresponding increase in the interest we earn on our assets. The impact of these increases would be most prevalent with respect to our Agency RMBS backed by fixed rate mortgage loans because the interest rate on a fixed-rate mortgage loan does not change even though market rates may change. 
 
 In order to protect our net interest margin against increases in short-term interest rates, we may enter into interest rate swaps, which economically convert our floating-rate repurchase agreement debt to fixed-rate debt or utilize other hedging instruments such as Fed Funds, SOFR and T-Note futures contracts, dual digital options or interest rate swaptions. 
 
 Summary 
 
 The long-awaited impacts of tight monetary policy orchestrated by the Fed appear to have finally slowed inflation sufficiently such that the Fed could re-focus on its second mandate full employment in the economy. The labor market data over the course of the second and third quarters of 2024 reflected greater balance between the supply and demand for labor, such that hiring and wage growth were slowing and the unemployment rate was rising gradually. In late September 2024, the Fed reduced the Fed funds rate by 50 basis points, and the market anticipated it was the first of many such cuts. In contrast, growth in the economy, as measured by both GDP and GDI as well as consumer spending, has remained robust throughout. However, the non-farm payroll report for September 2024, released in early October, as well as the latest readings on inflation were robust and exceeded market expectations. Should such signs of economic strength continue, the Fed may be more conservative in the timing and extent of further reductions in the Fed Funds rate than the market had expected at the beginning of the third quarter.

Interest rates decreased over the course of the third quarter of 2024, continuing the trend started in late April 2024. The U.S. Treasury curve also steepened as the market anticipated additional easing of monetary policy by the Fed and the spread between the 2-year and 10-year T-Notes finally turned positive in early September 2024 after being inverted since mid-2022, the longest inversion ever. Cheaper funding levels coupled with a still healthy economy were supportive of risk assets, and domestic fixed income securities all generated positive returns for the quarter. Agency RMBS also generated positive excess returns versus comparable duration swaps. Based on recent positive economic data, it is unclear how much further the Fed will go in relaxing monetary policy. Further, geo-political events around the world, especially in the Middle East, as well as the U.S. presidential election in November, are cause for uncertainty in the outlook for markets and the economy. The market in which the Company and Orchid Island invest the preponderance of their capital, the Agency RMBS market, has performed well so far in 2024, and potential returns available in the market remain attractive. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires our management to make some complex and subjective decisions, estimates and assessments. Our most critical accounting policies involve decisions, estimates and assessments which can have a material impact on reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and these estimates can change each reporting period. There have been no changes to the processes used to determine our critical accounting estimates as discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 
 As a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide disclosure pursuant to this Item. However, we have elected to include much of the information in Item 7 above. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report (the evaluation date ), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (the CEO and Chief Financial Officer (the CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded our disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and implemented, were effective as of the evaluation date (1) in ensuring that information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, by our employees, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (2) in providing reasonable assurance that information we must disclose in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods prescribed by the SEC s rules and forms. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no material changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 As previously disclosed, in April 2020 and November 2021, the Company received demands for payment from Citigroup, Inc. related to the indemnification provisions of various mortgage loan purchase agreements entered into prior to 2007. As of September 30, 2024, no further information has been received related to this matter. The ultimate resolution of this matter cannot presently be determined. However, in management's opinion, the demands are without merit and the likelihood of a material adverse outcome is remote. Accordingly, no provision or accrual has been recorded. 
 
 We are not party to any other material pending legal proceedings as described in Item 103 of Regulation S-K. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 10, 2024.
