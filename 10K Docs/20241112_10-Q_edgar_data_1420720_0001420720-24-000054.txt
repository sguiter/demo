 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 million which compares to the million loss from operations it maintained as of September 30, 2023. The history of significant losses, the negative cash flow from operations, the limited cash resources on hand and the dependence by the Company on its ability to obtain additional financing to fund its operations after the current cash resources are exhausted raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management s current financing and business plans have not mitigated such substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 (the Quarterly Report ). In an effort to mitigate the substantial doubt about continuing as a going concern and increase cash reserves, the Company has raised funds from time to time through equity offerings or other financing alternatives, reduced its workforce, entered into a collaboration agreement to discover and develop novel antibodies for obesity and other cardiometabolic diseases and sold certain intellectual property rights. Potential options being considered to further increase liquidity include focusing product development on a select number of product candidates, the sale or out-licensing of certain product candidates, raising money from the capital markets, grant revenue or collaborations, or a combination thereof. However, the Company anticipates that its expenses will increase as it continues its research and development activities and conducts clinical trials. On July 3, 2024, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the ATM Agreement with Chardan Capital Markets, LLC and Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC (collectively, the Sales Agents providing for the issuance and sale by the Company of its common stock, par value per share (the Common Stock ), from time to time, through the Sales Agents, with certain limitations on the amount of Common Stock that may be offered and sold by the Company as set forth in the ATM Agreement (the ATM ). Offers and sales of shares of Common Stock by the Company, if any, under the ATM Agreement, is subject to the effectiveness of the Company s shelf registration statement on Form S-3, filed with the SEC on July 3, 2024 which became effective on August 6, 2024. The aggregate market value of the shares of Common Stock eligible for sale under the ATM prospectus supplement included in the Registration Statement is currently , which is based on the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3. No Common Stock was sold under this agreement as of September 30, 2024. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities, and reported expenses that may be necessary if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern. Reverse Stock Split On November 27, 2023, the Company s Board approved the implementation of a reverse stock split (the 2023 Reverse Split at a ratio of one-for-twenty 1 : shares of the Company's Common Stock. The 2023 Reverse Split was effective as of November 29, 2023.

 Overview iBio, Inc. iBio, we, us, or our is a preclinical stage biotechnology company leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the development of hard-to-drug precision antibodies. Our core mission is to harness the potential of AI and machine learning (ML) to unveil elusive biologics that stand out and have evaded other scientists. Through our innovative platform, we champion a culture of innovation by identifying novel targets, forging strategic collaborations to enhance efficiency, diversify pipelines, and with the goal of accelerating preclinical processes. Our proprietary technology stack is designed to minimize downstream development risks by employing AI-guided epitope-steering and monoclonal antibody (mAb) optimization. Our groundbreaking EngageTx technology enables us to target bi-specific molecules. With the ability to navigate sequence diversity and promote Human-Cyno cross reactivity while mitigating cytokine release, our goal is to enhance agility and bolster preclinical safety assessments. Another key feature of our technology stack is our ShieldTx masking technology in order to keep antibodies inactive until they reach diseased tissue, where the masks are removed, and the antibodies are activated, all with the goal of broadening the therapeutic window, potentially improving efficacy and safety of treatments. Our strategic approach to fulfilling our mission is outlined as follows: Further develop and expand the our technology stack: We are continuously expanding and developing our technology stack to tackle current challenges in antibody discovery. o Current challenges in antibody discovery: Key challenges in today s antibody discovery techniques include: A limited number of drug targets that can be pursued with traditional antibody discovery techniques. Lack of antibodies with complex mechanisms of action. Safety concerns for antibodies against widely expressed targets. Significant time required to optimize antibody leads. Lack of early assessment of the developability of antibodies. 
 o Our technology platform addresses current challenges in antibody discovery: Our epitope steering technology allows the precise targeting of antibodies against hard-to-drug proteins and challenging target epitopes. This is believed to unlock a vast novel target space and enable the targeting of newly identified epitopes on well-validated proteins for best-in-class drug development. While the vast majority of approved antibodies function by disrupting protein-protein interactions, the discovery of antibodies with more complex mechanisms has been challenging. Our ability to steer antibodies towards agonistic or cell-activating epitopes, or epitopes that lock protein complexes in certain active or inactive conformations, is believed to enable the creation of antibodies with a wide variety of complex modes of action. 
 Although bispecific antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates have proven to be highly efficacious, they have also raised safety concerns. Our ShieldTx technology is an integrated part of the discovery process, designed to allow antibodies to be masked and rendered inactive until they reach the intended tissue (e.g., a tumor), where the mask is removed and the antibody is activated. ShieldTx is believed to have the capability of reducing or eliminating adverse effects stemming from off-target tissue effects, increase the probability of success in identifying a fitting mask, and reduce development time. Lastly, our StableHu technology, coupled with mammalian display technology, has been shown in pre-clinical studies to allow for the reduction of lead optimization times by utilizing single-shot multi-dimensional optimization techniques. This also improves the developability of lead antibodies early in the discovery process. Capital efficient business approach: Our strategic business approach is structured around the following pillars of value creation:

Table of Contents 
 o Strategic Collaborations : We have leveraged our platform and pipeline by forming strategic partnerships. We aim to become the preferred partner for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking rapid and cost-effective integration of complex molecules into their portfolios, de-risking their early-stage pre-clinical work. Additionally, rich array of fast follower immune-oncology molecules within the Company s pre-clinical pipeline holds the potential to drive substantial partnerships, opening doors to innovative projects. By tapping into our infrastructure and expertise, partners have the potential to streamline timelines, reduce costs tied to biologic drug discovery applications and cell line process development, and expedite preclinical programs with efficiency. o Developing and advancing our in-house programs cost effectively : Clinical advancement is crucial for drug discovery. As we continue to develop our existing immune-oncology pre-clinical pipeline, we are also seeking strategic partners with the capabilities to more rapidly advance these programs towards the clinic. We also continue to assess our option rights to license three of the four assets under the collaboration with AstralBio to expand our pre-clinical pipeline into obesity and cardiometabolic programs and with the goal to become a clinical stage company. o Tech Licensing in Diverse Therapeutic Areas: In pursuit of adding value, we are exploring partnerships in diverse therapeutic domains such as CNS or vaccines. Our intention is to license our AI tech stack, extending its benefits to our partners and amplifying its biological impact and insights. This strategic approach enables us to capitalize on the value of our meticulously curated data while empowering collaborations and innovations, while at the same time allowing us to focus on both the platform and our core therapeutic areas, metabolic diseases and oncology. 
 Focused Investment in advancing the platform: We maintain a focused commitment to invest in our platform, continually unlocking the potential of biology through AI and ML. The pinnacle of being on the forefront of ML advancing algorithms, and models in order to improve its predictive power and reduce the time it takes to find a viable molecule. 
 In essence, we believe that we are sculpting a future where cutting-edge AI-driven biotechnology propels the discovery of intricate biologics, fostering partnerships, accelerating innovation, and propelling the advancement of science. AI Drug Discovery Platform Overview Our platform comprises of five key components, each playing a crucial role in the discovery and optimization of precision antibodies. The first layer, epitope engineering, leverages the patented AI-engine to target specific regions of proteins, allowing us to engineer antibodies with high specificity and efficacy. The second layer involves the proprietary antibody library, which is built on clinically validated frameworks and offers a rich diversity of human antibodies. The third layer of the technology stack is the antibody optimizing StableHu AI technology, coupled with mammalian display technology. Next, we use our EngageTx T-cell engager platform to create bispecific antibodies. And last, antibodies are transformed into conditionally activated antibodies by ShieldTx, our antibody masking technology. Each layer of the tech stack is designed to work synergistically, enabling us to rapidly advance antibodies from concept to in vivo proof-of-concept (POC).

 AI Epitope Steering Technology 
 Our epitope steering technology is designed to address these issues by guiding antibodies exclusively against the desired regions of the target protein. By focusing on these specific regions, we can overcome the limitations of traditional methods and significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our antibody discovery process. Our AI engine creates engineered epitopes, which are small embodiments of epitopes on the target protein. The engine is trained to match the epitope structure as closely as possible and refine the designs for greater stability and water solubility, which are critically important factors. The optimized engineered epitope is then used to identify antibodies from na ve or immunized libraries. Na ve Human Antibody Library 
 The fully human antibody library is built upon clinically validated, entirely human antibody frameworks. By leveraging public databases, we have extracted a diverse array of Complementarity-Determining Region CDR sequences. Subsequently, we have meticulously eliminated a range of sequence liabilities. Such careful curation process could potentially significantly reduce the development risk for antibodies identified from our library. StableHu TM AI Antibody-Optimizing Technology 
 Our proprietary StableHu technology is instrumental in the optimization process. StableHu is an AI-powered tool designed to predict a library of antibodies with fully human CDR variants based on an input antibody. This input can range from an early, unoptimized molecule to an approved drug. The model has been trained utilizing a set of over 1 billion human antibodies, progressively masking known amino acids within CDRs until the algorithm could predict the correct human sequence. While phage display libraries are often used in antibody optimization due to their vast diversity, they can increase developability risks such as low expression, instability, or aggregation of antibodies. Mammalian display libraries, on the other hand, offer significantly improved developability but reduced diversity due to the smaller library size they can handle. StableHu overcomes this limitation by utilizing a machine learning algorithm generating focused library diversity within the capacity of mammalian display. Mammalian display is a technology that presents antibodies on the surface of mammalian cells, allowing for the direct screening and selection of antibodies in a mammalian cell environment. This approach is advantageous as antibodies that express well on the mammalian cells used in the display are more likely to express well in the production cell line. Moreover, single-cell sorting of antibody-displaying cells allows rapid selection of desired antibodies based on multiple dimensions, such as potency, selectivity, and cross-species selectivity. When paired with mammalian display technology, StableHu enables antibody optimization with fewer iterative optimization steps, lower immunogenicity risk, and improved developability. EngageTx CD3-Based T-Cell Engager Panel 
 We have used antibodies from an epitope steering campaign as well as a first-generation T-cell engager as input and utilized our StableHu technology to identify a next-generation CD3 antibody panel. The sequence diversity generated by StableHu led to an antibody panel with a wide range of potencies, which allows us to pair the panel with a wide variety of tumor-targeting antibodies. Importantly, we were able to retain T-cell activation and tumor cell killing capacity with significantly reduced cytokine release. This reduction is believed to lower the risk of cytokine release syndrome. Additionally, the increased humanness of the predicted antibodies, thanks to our StableHu technology, has the ability to reduce the risk of immunogenicity. Furthermore, our StableHu technology enabled us to engineer NHP cross-reactivity into EngageTx. This allows for advanced safety assessment in NHP ahead of clinical trials, providing another layer of safety assurance.

 ShieldTx 
 We have enhanced our proprietary technology with the introduction of ShieldTx, patent-pending innovative antibody masking technique. ShieldTx leverages our engineered epitope technology, which is utilized not only for the identification of antibodies against complex drug targets but also for concealing the antibodies' active sites. A significant hurdle in therapeutic antibody development is the expression of drug target on both healthy and diseased tissues, leading to adverse effects on non-targeted tissues. ShieldTx is designed to address this challenge by rendering antibodies inactive until they reach a specific environment unique to diseased tissues. Upon contact with this environment, the masking element is detached, activating the antibody. In the tumor microenvironment this is achieved by a highly expressed matrix metalloproteinase. This strategy aims to minimize or eliminate unintended effects on healthy tissues, thereby improving the safety profile and reducing the immunogenicity risks associated with bispecific antibodies. Modalities Epitope steering, an innovative AI-based technology we are pioneering, has the potential to positively impact various areas of medicine. Foremost in immuno-oncology, this technology is instrumental in creating targeted antibodies against specific cancer antigens, potentially enhancing the efficacy of treatments like checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T therapies. Similarly, in the battle against obesity and cardiometabolic disorders, epitope steering enables the discovery of therapeutics aimed at systemic secreted and cell-surface agents key factors in these prevalent health issues. Its application could potentially lead to emerging treatments in cardiovascular diseases by targeting specific damaged tissues. Beyond these areas, epitope steering may contribute to advancements in treating immune system diseases, neurological conditions, infectious diseases, and rare genetic disorders. In the specialized field of intratumoral immuno-oncology, there is potential for epitope steering to modify the tumor microenvironment, which could improve the outcomes of immune-stimulatory protein therapies. Additionally, the precision offered by epitope steering could play a role in the next generation of cancer vaccines, aiming to enhance T cell responses. While the prospects are broad, epitope steering remains a hopeful strategy in the development of novel treatments, extending through pain management, and potentially even vaccine development for complex protein structures that have been difficult to target. Collaborations and Partnerships As noted above, one of the three pillars of value creation that structures of our strategic business approach are strategic collaborations and partnerships. At the center of such pillar is our AI Discovery Platform. In March 2024, we entered into a collaboration with AstralBio to discover and develop novel antibodies for obesity and other cardiometabolic diseases. As part of the collaboration, we granted an exclusive license to AstralBio of our AI-powered technology to identify and engineer four (4) targets for the treatment of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases, of which AstralBio may continue the pre-clinical development and deploy its proven drug development expertise to advance candidates to an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. We have the exclusive option to license three (3) obesity and cardiometabolic targets from AstralBio and as a result, we will receive the rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize those targets upon exercise. As a result of this collaboration, one of the first programs is initiating the development of an anti-myostatin antibody program focused on targeting the transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) superfamily for the treatment of muscle wasting and obesity. Upon mutual consent with AstralBio, we may also expand the collaboration to include additional targets in other fields. During the first quarter FY 2024, we entered into a collaboration with a partner to license the use of our AI Discovery Platform to assist such partner with two targets of interest. During the second quarter FY 2024, we entered into a collaboration with a large pharmaceutical company to assist such partner by using our patented AI-driven epitope steering platform to assist with one "hard to develop" molecule. In June 2023, we entered into a research collaboration with the NIAID, a component of the NIH, to investigate the potential of our patented AI-driven epitope steering platform for the development of a vaccine for Lassa fever, a sometimes fatal viral disease endemic to parts of West Africa. Under the collaboration, we worked with the NIAID s Vaccine Research Center to determine whether using our AI Discovery Platform to steer immunity toward viral epitopes identified by the vaccine center s researchers could offer advantages over other vaccine development approaches. We designed ten engineered epitopes for the collaboration, which were screened for binding to three known Lassa fever neutralizing antibodies, alongside the NIAID 's Vaccines Research Center s internal epitope designs. Importantly, our engineered epitopes showed binding to the Lassa neutralizing antibodies and were among the top-ranked hits regarding expression, an important consideration for cost-effective vaccine production. While the NIAID elected not to proceed with joint optimization of the lead hits, we enhanced our discovery process as a result of the collaboration, incorporating diffusion-based generative

 AI models into our engineered epitope designs. The new models are already contributing to our pipeline development and are being used with current partners. We continue to seek out opportunities for future collaborations using our AI Discovery Platform. Pipeline We are currently in the process of building and advancing our preclinical pipeline by leveraging our technology stack focused on hard-to-drug targets and molecules offering differentiation in both in obesity and cardiometabolic disease space, as well as immune-oncology. As we continue to leverage our technology stack and develop our existing immune-oncology pre-clinical pipeline, we are also seeking strategic partners with the capabilities to more rapidly advance these programs towards the clinic. We also continue to assess our option rights to license three of the four assets under the AstralBio collaboration to add obesity and cardiometabolic programs into our pre-clinical pipeline. Under this strategic collaboration with AstraBio, it affords us the opportunity to expand pipeline and build a presence in the cardiometabolic disease space.

 Therapeutics Obesity/Cardiometabolic Diseases Anti-Myostatin Antibody Through our discovery collaboration with AstralBio, we are using our StableHu and mammalian display technology to discover and identify antibodies against myostatin, the first of four targets for the treatment of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. This initial campaign s goal is to design antibodies preventing it from binding to the myostatin receptor and which are differentiated against competitor anti-myostatin antibodies. Pharmacological intervention targeting myostatin can be achieved by either blocking myostatin from interacting with its receptor or by targeting the receptor directly. The discovery campaign will be designed to, among other goals, optimize potency, specificity, developability and half-life of novel molecules. Myostatin, also known as growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF8), is a transforming growth factor- (TGF- family member that functions to limit skeletal muscle growth and inhibits muscle growth. A loss of function in the myostatin gene leads to a reduction or absence of this inhibitory effect, resulting in increased muscle mass and strength. This genetic alteration can cause significant muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia, meaning individuals or animals with myostatin loss of function have larger and more numerous muscle fibers. While this can be beneficial for muscle development, it may also have implications for overall metabolism and cardiovascular health. In November 2024, we have completed an initial manufacturing run of non-cGMP material of our lead molecule in order to complete the initial dosing within an in vivo non-human primate (NHP) study with potential early readouts in early calander 2025. Immuno-Oncology IBIO-101 IBIO-101 is a second-generation anti-CD25 mAb that has demonstrated in preclinical models of disease the ability to bind and deplete immunosuppressive regulatory T Treg cells to inhibit the growth of solid tumors. Targeting depletion of Treg cells to control tumors emerged as an area of interest in oncology over the past several years. Since Treg cells express interleukin-2 R IL-2R or CD25 ), it was envisioned mAbs could be developed that bind CD25 and thereby trigger depletion by Natural Killer cells, resulting in stimulation of anti-tumor immunity. Unfortunately, while first-generation mAbs successfully bound CD25 + cells, they also interfered with interleukin-2 IL-2 signaling to T effector Teff cells to activate their cancer cell killing effects. The result was a failure of first-gen anti-CD25 mAbs as cancer immunotherapies, since their favorable anti-Treg effects were negated by their unfavorable impact on Teff cells. In vitro characterization of IBIO-101 demonstrated potent binding to recombinant CD25 while preserving IL-2 signaling. Further assessment of IBIO-101 showed selective Treg depletion and sparing of Teffs. In a humanized mouse disease model, IBIO-101, when used as a monotherapy, effectively demonstrated its mechanism of action by significantly enhancing the Treg/Teff ratio, resulting in the suppression of tumor growth. When paired with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in the same model, the combined treatment of IBIO-101 and anti-PD-1 exhibited superior tumor inhibition compared to either anti-PD-1 or IBIO-101 used independently. We have progressed IBIO-101 to the IND-enabling phase and entrusted its Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) development to a Contract Research Organization (CRO). In the initial stages of this process, IBIO-101 has exhibited promising attributes for CMC progression. Notably, we've pinpointed optimal cell lines for master cell bank creation and have set in place a CMC methodology to produce IBIO-101 in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, standards. An anti-CD25 antibody, such as IBIO-101, could be applicable in a number of indications including solid tumors, leukemia, and potentially additional orphan diseases. The Company continues to review the IL-2 sparing anti-CD25 antibody program, IBIO-101, including evaluating whether it can be utilized in certain orphan diseases. If such evaluation is promising, the Company will determine whether to initiate discussions with FDA before the end of calendar year 2025 to outline a potential clinical pathway for the program.

 TROP-2 x CD3 Bispecific We have identified highly potent, fully human TROP-2 (Trophoblast Cell Surface Antigen 2) monoclonal antibodies, which have been formatted into bispecific TROP-2 x CD3 molecules using our T-cell engager antibody panel, EngageTx. TROP-2 is highly expressed in multiple solid tumors, including breast, lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers and is closely linked to metastasis and tumor growth. TROP-2 antibody drug conjugates have been developed to deliver toxic payloads to these cancer cells but could risk harming healthy cells and cause adverse effects. Our bispecific approach has the potential to increase the therapeutic window, while promoting a robust and long-lasting anti-tumor response. Combining the bispecific TROP-2 approach with immunotherapies like checkpoint inhibitors can potentially lead to improved clinical outcomes. Using EngageTx, our lead TROP-2 x CD3 bispecific antibody was engineered to potently kill tumor cells while limiting the release of cytokines, like Interferon Gamma IFNg ), Interleukin 2 (IL-2) and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha TNFa ), all of which have the potential to cause cytokine release syndrome. When compared to a bispecific molecule engineered with our TROP-2 binding arm and a first generation CD3 engager, SP34, our lead TROP-2 x CD3 bispecific antibody showed a markedly reduced cytokine release profile, potentially indicating a decreased risk for cytokine release syndrome. When tested in a humanized mouse model of squamous cell carcinoma, our lead TROP-2 x CD3 bi-specific antibody demonstrated a significant 36 percent reduction in tumor size within just 14 days after tumor implantation, and after only a single dose. MUC16 MUC16 is a well-known cancer target often overexpressed in several types of solid tumors, including ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancers. Specifically, MUC16 is a large extracellular protein expressed on more than 80 of ovarian tumors. Tumor cells can evade immune attack by shedding or glycosylating MUC16, making it difficult for traditional antibody therapies to effectively target and destroy the cancer cells. Using our patented epitope steering AI platform, our innovative approach to this challenge allows our new mAbs to bind to a specific region of MUC16 that is not shed or glycosylated, circumventing both tumor evasion mechanisms and potentially providing a powerful tool in the fight against cancer. During its immunization and screening campaign, we identified several hits that specifically bound to the non-shed region of MUC16 while no binding to the shed fragment of MUC16 was observed. Establishing antibodies with the ability to bind to a recombinant version of their target protein represents a vital initial step in the validation process. However, it's crucial to ensure such antibodies maintain their binding affinity in a whole cell context, specifically when the target protein is expressed on a cell's surface. To best predict therapeutic efficacy, it's recommended to utilize tumor cells as a means to demonstrate and confirm this cell binding capability. During pre-clinical studies, our lead MUC16 molecule has demonstrated binding to MUC16 on OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells. Another critical step in antibody optimization is the humanization of molecules originally raised in mice or other species. Humanization efforts of antibodies carry the risk of, among other things, losing binding strength. After engineering the leading MUC16 molecule with a fully human framework, our MUC16 molecule retained potent binding to the engineered epitope and maintained binding to human OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells. EGFRvIII EGFRvIII is a specific variant of the EGFR protein, unique to tumor cells. Unlike the more common EGFR, EGFRvIII is not found in healthy cells, making it an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. This variant is most prominently associated with glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer and head and neck cancer but can also be present in certain cases of breast, lung, and ovarian cancers, among others. In our pursuit of innovative treatments, we are exploring antibody therapeutics that specifically target EGFRvIII, aiming to address these cancer types without affecting healthy cells. Leveraging our patented AI-enabled epitope steering engine, we've specifically directed antibodies to target a unique epitope found exclusively on EGFRvIII, and not on the wildtype receptor, EGFR. Through this precision approach, we have designed tumor-specific molecules aimed at selectively targeting cancer cells while preserving healthy ones, potentially offering patients a more focused and safer therapeutic solution. Our hit molecules have demonstrated strong binding to the tumor-specific EGFRvIII protein without targeting the wildtype EGFR. Additionally, these molecules have effectively eliminated tumor cells, while sparing healthy ones, in in vitro cell killing tests. Our lead anti-EGFRvIII antibody was specially engineered to enhance its ability to attack cancer cells and has proven effective in a mouse model

 for head and neck cancer. In preclinical studies, our anti-EGFRvIII antibody demonstrated a 43 percent reduction in tumor growth compared to untreated animals. CCR8 GPCRs are one of the most successful therapeutic target classes, with approximately one-third of all approved drugs targeting these proteins. Compared to small molecule-based GPCR drugs, antibody-based GPCR therapeutics potentially offer several potential advantages, including superior selectivity, extended mechanisms of action, and longer half-life. However, GPCRs are intricate, multi-membrane spanning receptors, making clinically relevant regions difficult to identify and target. The chemokine receptor CCR8 is a GPCR which is predominantly expressed on Tregs, which play a role in suppressing immune responses. In the context of cancer, Tregs can inhibit the body's natural immune response against tumor cells, promoting cancer progression. Anti-CCR8 antibodies are being explored as a therapeutic strategy to deplete these Tregs in the tumor environment. By targeting and reducing Tregs using anti-CCR8 antibodies, the hope is to enhance the body's immune response against cancer cells, offering a promising avenue for cancer treatment. Aiming directly at CCR8 is believed to be a safer approach because it focuses on specific suppressive Treg cells in the tumor environment without affecting other immune cells and functions. It is important to make sure antibodies are fine-tuned to CCR8 and don't mistakenly target a similar receptor, CCR4. This is because CCR4 is found in many immune cells, and accidentally targeting it could potentially lead to unwanted side effects. Using our unique AI-driven technology, we have successfully identified molecules targeting CCR8, addressing some of the hurdles often faced when creating therapies that target GPCR with antibodies. Our specialized anti-CCR8 antibody has shown strong attachment to cells expressing CCR8 and effectively disrupted the CCR8 signaling process, resulting in the efficient elimination of Tregs derived from primary human immune cells. Notably, our CCR8-focused molecule did not attach to cells overproducing CCR4, highlighting its precision in targeting only CCR8. Our CCR8 antibody has proven effective in a mouse model for colon cancer. Preclinical studies show our anti-CCR8 molecule inhibited tumor growth and achieved a 22 percent reduction in tumor size compared to its pre-treatment dimensions. We have specifically engineered the anti-CCR8 molecule as a high Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) antibody to enhance its ability to attack cancer cells. Recent Developments Brenner Amended and Restated Employment Agreement On July 23, 2024, we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement (the Restated Brenner Employment Agreement ), effective as of July 1, 2024 with Martin Brenner, our Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer.

No Common Stock was sold under this agreement as of September 30, 2024. Amendment to Code of Ethics On July 2, 2024, we approved and adopted an updated Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the Code ), which applies to all of our directors, officers and employees. The Code supersedes the existing Code of Business Conduct and Ethics adopted by the Board. The Code has been updated to modernize its language and structure, promote mitigation of risk with our personnel, and better reflect changes in our day-to-day operations and work environment. Liquidity and Capital Resources The history of significant losses, the negative cash flow from operations, the limited cash resources on hand and the dependence by the Company on its ability to obtain additional financing to fund its operations after the current cash resources are exhausted raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our management concluded that our recurring losses from operations and the fact that we have not generated significant revenue or positive cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months from the date of filing this Report for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. Our auditors also included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024 with respect to this uncertainty. In an effort to mitigate the substantial doubt about continuing as a going concern and increase cash reserves, we have raised funds from time to time through equity offerings or other financing alternatives, reduced our workforce, entered into a collaboration agreement to discover and develop novel antibodies for obesity and other cardiometabolic diseases and sold certain intellectual property rights. Potential options being considered to further increase liquidity, focusing product development on a select number of product candidates, the sale or out-licensing of certain product candidates, raising money from the capital markets, grant revenue or collaborations, or a combination thereof. However, we anticipate that our expenses will increase as it continues its research and development activities and conducts clinical trials. On July 3, 2024, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the ATM Agreement with Chardan Capital Markets, LLC and Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC (the Sales Agents providing for the sale by the Company of its common stock, par value 0.001 per share (the Common Stock ), from time to time, through the Sales Agents, with certain limitations on the amount of Common Stock that may be offered and sold by us as set forth in the ATM Agreement (the ATM ). Offers and sales of shares of Common Stock by us, if any, under the ATM Agreement, is subject to the effectiveness of our shelf registration statement on Form S-3, filed with the SEC on July 3, 2024 which became effective on August 6, 2024. The aggregate market value of the shares of Common Stock eligible for sale under the ATM prospectus supplement included in the Registration Statement is currently 7,350,000, which is based on the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3. No Common Stock was sold under this agreement as of September 30, 2024. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately 11.3 million as of September 30, 2024, is anticipated to be sufficient to support operations into the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, unless we reduce our burn rate further or raise additional capital. Regardless of whether we are able to reduce our burn rate or sell or out-license certain assets or parts of the business, we will need to raise additional capital in order to fully execute our longer-term business plans. It is the our goal to implement one or more potential options described above to allow us to have a cash runway for at least 12 months from the date of the filing of this Report. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing any of the options that we are evaluating. Results of Operations - Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenue Our ongoing business is primarily focused on i) development of our pipeline for which we do not expect revenue for many years, if at all, and ii) on our AI-driven discovery platform for which to date we have not generated any material revenue. We may have revenue with the AI-driven discovery platform in the future. No revenue was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was related to a research licensing agreement utilizing our AI-driven discovery platform.

 Research and Development Expenses R D R D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.3 million and 1.6 million, respectively, a reduction of approximately 0.3) million. The decrease in R D expenses is mainly due to the reduction in personnel costs and decrease spend for consultants or outside services due to certain tasks and assays being performed in-house which were previously outsourced. General and Administrative Expenses G A G A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 2.8 million and 3.5 million, respectively, a decrease of 0.7) million. The decrease in expenses is primarily attributable to the reduction in personnel costs, a decrease in insurance premiums and a decrease in legal and consulting fees. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in accounting fees and travel expeses. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses, consisting primarily of R D and G A expenses, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 4.1 million, compared to approximately 5.2 million in the same period of fiscal year 2023. Discontinued Operations On November 2, 2022, we announced our plans to divest our contract development and manufacturing organization (iBio CDMO, LLC) in order to complete our transformation into an AI-driven precision antibody discovery and development company. In conjunction with the divestment, we completed a workforce reduction and discontinued the CDMO operations. CDMO operations were classified as discontinued operations on our financial statements through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The loss for Discontinued Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 0.7) million which consisted mainly of interest related to the iBio CDMO entered into a Credit Agreement, dated November 1, 2021 (the Credit Agreement ), with Woodforest National Bank Woodforest pursuant to which Woodforest provided iBio CDMO a 22,375,000 secured term loan (the Term Loan to purchase the 130,000 square foot cGMP facility located in Bryan, Texas (the Facility ), which Term Loan was evidenced by a term note (the Term Note on the Facility and costs to maintain the Facility. Net Loss from Continuing Operations Net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.9) million, or 0.46) per share. Net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 5.1) million, or 4.24) per share. Uses of Cash and Funding Requirements Net Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 3.7) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in operating activities of 5.3) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The use of cash was primarily attributable to funding our net loss for the period. Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities of approximately 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the payment received for interest and principal on the promissory note receivable. Net cash provided by investing activities was approximately 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 0.2) million and was attributable to payments towards debt, including the finance lease obligations, term promissory not and equipment financing loan. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Funding Requirements We have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our spin-off from Integrated BioPharma in August 2008. As of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit was approximately 317.8) million and we used approximately 3.7)

 million of cash for operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2023, our accumulated deficit was approximately 294.7) million and we used approximately 5.3) million of cash for operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2023. We plan to fund our future business operations using cash on hand, through proceeds realized in connection with the commercialization of our technologies, through potential proceeds from the sale or out-licensing of assets, and through proceeds from the sale of additional equity or other securities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing these plans, many of which will take several years before we realize proceeds. We cannot be certain that such funding will be available on favorable terms or available at all. If we are unable to raise funds when required or on favorable terms, this assumption may no longer be operative, and we may have to: a) significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the product application and/or commercialization of our proprietary technologies; b) seek collaborators for our technology and product candidates on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; c) relinquish or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product candidates, or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize; or d) possibly cease operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities SPE s), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually limited purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we were not involved in any SPE transactions. Critical Accounting Estimates Our condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and all applicable U.S. GAAP accounting standards effective as of September 30, 2024, have been taken into consideration in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Some of those estimates are subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. We base our estimates, to the extent possible, on historical experience. Historical information is modified as appropriate based on current business factors and various assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes when necessary. Actual results could differ from our estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with U.S. GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The following accounting estimate had a material impact on our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets For indefinite life intangible assets, we perform an impairment test annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Evaluating for impairment requires judgment, including the estimation of future cash flows, future growth rates and profitability and the expected life over which cash flows will occur. Changes in our business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge. Although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ from these estimates. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we performed our annual impairment testing of the IBIO-101 therapeutic technology (or IP ), classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, which had a carrying amount of 5 million at June 30, 2024. We engaged a third party to perform valuation assistance with estimating the fair value of IBIO-101 and preparing a market capitalization reconciliation. The Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method MPEEM under the income approach was utilized to value the indefinite-lived asset. The MPEEM determines the value of a specified asset by calculating the present value of future earnings attributed to the asset. Since IBIO-101 is currently in its pre-clinical development phase, a probability of success was applied to the cash flows to account for the probability of reaching each step of development. The MPEEM requires that charges for the use of other contributory assets be subtracted under the theory that the owner of the subject asset does not own the other contributory assets and would have to rent/lease them in order to earn the cash flows related to the subject asset. The resulting probability of success adjusted excess earnings were discounted to the present value using a 16 discount rate, which was based on iBio s weighted average cost of capital. The sum of the discounted excess earnings and the present value of the tax benefit 

 45 

Table of Contents 
 related to amortization of the IBIO-101 indefinite-lived intangible indicated that the fair value was 5.9 million as of the June 30, 2024, valuation date. Given that the carrying amount of the asset was 5 million at June 30, 2024, it was concluded that no impairment existed. There were no triggering events identified in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. We will continue to monitor the value of the IP as part of our annual accounting policy for impairment of long-lived assets. The primary impairment indicators that may arise in the near future are (1) any sustained decline in our common stock market price and (2) FDA decisions on similar competing technologies that are applying for Phase 1 approval. We continue to operate in a highly competitive environment, rising interest rates (and cost of capital) and experience liquidity challenges. Accordingly, we may have to adjust our cash flow projections and valuation assumptions in the near future to account for market trends and any changes to our research and development plans. Any such future adjustments may lead to material future impairments in the IP and other related assets. Our remaining critical accounting estimates remain consistent with the information disclosed in the same section in our last annual report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended June 30, 2024. In addition to the aforementioned critical accounting estimates, the following accounting policies and estimates have been highlighted as significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our consolidated financial statements: revenue recognition; legal and contractual contingencies; research and development expenses; and share-based compensation expenses. We base our estimates, to the extent possible, on historical experience. Historical information is modified as appropriate based on current business factors and various assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes when necessary. Actual results could differ from our estimates. See Note 4 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and estimates. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item 3. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer (our Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our Principal Financial Officer) have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on our evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. Litigation, regardless of the outcome, could have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the information disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, contained in the Annual Report. Except as described below, our risk factors as of the date of this Report have not changed materially from those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report. We are reviewing potential options to extend our cash runway. This review could impact our future operations and financial position. We are currently evaluating a number of potential options to expand our cash runway, the implementation of which will impact our liquidity. In an effort to improve liquidity and our runway, we have consummated the sale of our Facility, reduced our work force, signed a collaboration with AstralBio with to discover and develop novel antibodies for obesity and other cardiometabolic diseases, entered into a securities purchase agreement for a PIPE financing resulting in gross proceeds of approximately 15.0 million. Potential options being considered to further increase liquidity, focusing product development on a select number of product candidates, the sale or out-licensing of certain product candidates, raising money from the capital markets, grant revenue or collaborations, or a combination thereof. However, we anticipate that our expenses will increase as we continue our research and development activities and conduct clinical trials. Despite the proceeds from the PIPE financing, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 11.3 million as of September 30, 2024, is not anticipated to be sufficient to support our operations beyond the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, unless we reduce our burn rate further, sublease all or a portion of the San Diego Lease, or raise additional capital. Regardless of whether we are able to reduce our burn rate or sell or out-license certain assets or parts of the business, we will need to raise additional capital in order to fully execute our near and long-term business plans. There can be no assurance that our collaboration with AstralBio will be successful or will entered into agreements for the sale or out-licensing of any of our product candidates on favorable terms or that the exploration of potential options will result in any agreements or transactions, or that, if completed, any agreements or transactions will be successful or on attractive terms. If we determine to change our business strategy, our future business, prospects, financial position and operating results could be significantly different than those in historical periods or projected by our management. Because of the significant uncertainty regarding our future plans, we are not able to accurately predict the impact of a potential change in our business strategy and future funding requirements. Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to our ability to operate as a going concern. We have incurred net losses and used significant cash in operating activities since inception, and we expect to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, we have an accumulated deficit of 317.8 million. As a result of our continued losses, our cash resources have not been sufficient to sustain our operations, and we have continued to depend on financing transactions to generate sufficient cash to stay in operation. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we used net cash in operating activities of 3.7 million and we are currently incurring negative operating cash flows of approximately 1.1 million per month. We held cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 9.4 million as of November 11, 2024. Based on current trends and activities, there is significant doubt that we can continue as a going concern beyond the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. We are currently evaluating a number of potential options to expand our cash runway, the implementation of which will impact our liquidity. Potential options being considered to increase liquidity include focusing product development on a select number of product candidates, the sale or out-licensing of certain product candidates or parts of the business, raising money from capital markets, grant revenue or collaborations, or a

 combination thereof. Regardless of whether we are able to reduce our burn rate or sell or out-licensing certain assets or parts of the business, we will need to raise additional capital in order to fully execute our longer-term business plan. We believe based on input from expert advisors, that it is likely we will be able to implement one or more options that will extend our cash runway for 12 months or more from the date of the filing of our Annual Report. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing any of the options that we are evaluating. Our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2024 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next 12 months. Our management concluded that our recurring losses from operations and the fact that we have not generated significant revenue or positive cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months after the issuance of out financial statements. Our auditors also included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024 with respect to this uncertainty. If we continue to experience operating losses, and we are not able to generate additional liquidity through a capital raise or other cash infusion, we might need to secure additional sources of funds, which may or may not be available to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to further scale back or discontinue the development of our product candidates or other research and development initiatives or initiate steps to cease operations or liquidate our assets. We have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses during our next Fiscal year, we do not anticipate generating significant revenue for several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability. Since our 2008 spinoff from Integrated BioPharma, we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. Our net loss was approximately 3.9) million and 5.7) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 317.8) million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of common stock, preferred stock and warrants. We are devoting substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including the development and validation of our technologies, and the development of a proprietary therapeutic products against oncology. We have not completed development of or commercialized any vaccine or therapeutic product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and may incur operating losses for at least the next year. We anticipate that our expenses and losses will increase substantially if we: initiate clinical trials of our product candidates; continue the research and development of our product candidates; seek to discover or license in additional candidates; and add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and manufacturing efforts. Our future profitability and cash flow in large part depends on our research and development programs, including our AI platform, and our ability to successfully develop, partner or commercialize our product candidates and to a lesser extent, which is not anticipated for several years. Our cash position is expected to limit the number of product candidates that we seek to develop. This will require us, alone or with our licensees and collaborators, to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which regulatory approval is obtained or establishing collaborations with parties willing and able to provide necessary capital or other value. We may never succeed in these activities. We may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. All of our existing product candidates are in various stages of development and will require extensive additional clinical evaluation, regulatory review and approval, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they could provide us with any revenue. As a result, even if we successfully develop, achieve regulatory approval and commercialize our products, we may be unable to generate revenue for many years, if at all. We do not anticipate that we will generate revenue from product sales for at least several years, if at all. If we are unable to generate revenue from product sales, we will not become profitable, and we may be unable to continue our operations. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would diminish the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.

 The exercise of the Series E Warrants to purchase up to 5,287,278 shares of our Common Stock and/or raising additional capital will cause dilution to stockholders. Our stockholders will experience substantial dilution from the issuance of shares of up to 5,287,278 Common Stock upon exercise of the outstanding Series E Warrants. To the extent that we raise additional capital through a public or private offering and sale of equity securities, the ownership interest of stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect rights as a stockholder. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock to investors, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company granted an employment inducement option agreement to an employee to purchase 15,000 shares of the Common Stock at an exercise price of 1.81 per share.
