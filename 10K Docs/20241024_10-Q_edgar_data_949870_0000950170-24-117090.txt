 million and million, respectively, in revenue related to product shipped prior to these dates. These amounts are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Customer promotional discount programs are entered into by the Company with distributors for certain periods of time. The reimbursements for discounts to distributors are recorded as reductions to net revenue and were million and million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The agreed-upon discount rates are applied to certain distributors' sales to retailers, based on volume metrics, in order to determine the total discounted amount. The computation of the dis count allowance requires that management make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amounts of revenue and liabilities recorded. Actual promotional discounts owed and paid have historically been in line with allowances recorded by the Company; however, the amounts could differ from the estimated allowance. Customer programs and incentives are a common practice in the alcohol beverage industry. Amounts paid in connection with customer programs and incentives are recorded as reductions to net revenue or as advertising, promotional and selling expenses, based on the nature of the expenditure. Customer incentives and other payments made to distributors are primarily based upon performance of certain marketing and advertising activities. Depending on applicable state laws and regulations, these activities promoting the Company's products may include, but are not limited to point-of-sale and merchandise placement, samples, product displays, promotional programs at retail locations and meals, travel and entertainment. Amounts paid to customers in connection with these programs that were recorded as reductions to net revenue or as advertising, promotional and selling expenses for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 were million and million, respectively. For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, the Company recorded million and milli on, respectively, of these costs as reductions to net revenue. Amounts paid to customers in connection with these programs for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 were million and million, respectively. For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded million and million, respectively, of these costs as reductions to net revenue. Costs recognized in net revenues include, but are not limited to, promotional discounts, sales incentives and certain other promotional activities. Costs recognized in advertising, promotional and selling exp enses include point of sale materials, samples and advertising expenditures in local markets. These costs are recorded as incurred, generally when invoices are received; however certain estimates are required at the period end. Estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each type of program or customer and have historically been in line with actual costs incurred.

 impairment of goodwill was recorded in any period. Intangible assets. The Company s intangible assets consist primarily of a trademark and customer relationships obtained through the Company s Dogfish Head acquisition. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. As of the September 28, 2024, the Dogfish Head trademark which was determined to have an indefinite useful life was not amortized. The guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. Under the quantitative assessment, the trademark is evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the trademark is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark, then an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value. The Company's annual impairment testing date is September 1st of each fiscal year. In 2024, this testing resulted in an impairment of the Company's Dogfish Head, Coney Island, and Angel City trademark assets of million, million, and million respectively. In 2023, this testing resulted in an impairment of the Company's Dogfish Head and Coney Island trademark assets of million and million, respectively. The Company evaluated the negative trends of the Dogfish Head brand including the brands off-plan performance through the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, which was attributable to continued sales declines in the brand's beer products, the overall declines in the craft beer industry sector, and lower than forecasted sales in its canned cocktails products due to increased competition. The Company updated its projections for the Dogfish Head brand including the forecasted revenue and royalty rate assumptions utilized in the determination of the fair value of the Dogfish Head trademark which included further reductions in revenues stemming from the foregoing factors as well as a reduction in the royalty rate assumption due to decreased profitability expected to be generated from the trademark. As a result of performing this assessment, the Dogfish Head trademark asset with a carrying value of million was written down to its estimated fair value of million. The negative craft beer trends impacting the Company s Dogfish Head brand have also had a negative impact on the Company s Coney Island and Angel City trademark assets. The Coney Island trademark asset with a carrying value of million was written down to and the Angel City trademark asset with a carrying value of million was written down to , resulting in a total impairment of million which was recorded during the thirteen weeks and thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024.

and , respectively, of its volume at Company-owned breweries. In the normal course of its business, the Company has historically entered into various production arrangements with other brewing companies. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company generally supplies raw materials and packaging to those brewing companies and incurs conversion fees for labor at the time the liquid is produced and packaged. The Company has made up-front payments that were used for capital improvements at these third-party production facilities that it expenses over the period of the contracts. Under these production arrangements, there are minimum production quantities and the Company is obligated to pay shortfall fees for production quantity below those thresholds . Total third-party production prepayments were million and million as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, all of which for both periods relate to its master transaction agreement with City Brewing Company, LLC ("City Brewing"). The Company will expense the total prepaid amount of million as of September 28, 2024 as a component of cost of goods sold over the contractual period ending December 31, 2025. At current production volume projections, the Company believes that it will fall short of its future annual volume commitments at certain third-party production facilities and will incur shortfall fees. The Company expenses the shortfall fees during the contractual period when such fees are incurred as a component of cost of goods sold. During the thirteen weeks and thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, the Company incurred million and million, respectively, in shortfall fees. During the thirteen weeks and thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred million and million, respectively, in shortfall fees. As of September 28, 2024, if volume for the remaining term of the production arrangements was zero, the contractual shortfall fees, with advance notice as specified in the related contractual agreements, would total approximately million over the duration of the contracts which have expiration dates through December 31, 2031. The Company has regular discussions with its third-party production suppliers related to its future capacity needs and the terms of its contracts. Changes to volume estimates, future amendments or cancellations of existing contracts could accelerate or change total shortfall fees expected to be incurred. At current volume projections and based on understandings reached with these third-party production facilities, the Company anticipates that it will recognize approximately million of shortfall fees and expects to record those expenses as follows :

The annual repayment limits are million in 2024, million in 2025 and million in 2026 and thereafter. The final maturity date of the loan is . The Company determined the fair value of the note receivable on the issuance date to be million. The million difference between the cash paid to City Brewing of million and the fair value of the note of million on issuance date has been recorded as a third-party production prepayment asset and will be recognized as a component of cost of goods sold over the term of the third-party production arrangement. The unamortized balance was million as of September 28, 2024. Interest income on the note receivable is being recognized over the term of the loan, which is to be repaid in full no later than . The Company received million repayment during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, of which million was applied to principal and the remaining million applied to interest. As of September 28, 2024 the Company had million fair value remaining on the note receivable.

Litigation The Company is party to legal proceedings and claims, where significant damages are asserted against it. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, it is possible that the Company could incur liabilities as a consequence of these claims, which may or may not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or the results of its operations. The Company accrues loss contingencies if, in the opinion of management and its legal counsel, the risk of loss is probable and the loss can be estimated. Material pending legal proceedings are discussed below. On December 31, 2022, Ardagh Metal Packaging USA Corp. Ardagh filed an action against the Company alleging, among other things, that the Company had failed to purchase contractual minimum volumes of certain aluminum beverage can containers in 2021 and 2022. The Company denies that it breached the terms of the parties contract and intends to defend against the Ardagh claims vigorously. On February 23, 2023 and April 4, 2023, Ardagh and the Company engaged in mediation sessions with a neutral, third-party mediator, but were not able to resolve the matter and the litigation will proceed. On May 5, 2023, the Company filed an Answer in response to the Complaint, and Counterclaims against Ardagh. On June 26, 2023, Ardagh filed a Motion to Dismiss Certain Counterclaims and a Motion to Strike Certain Affirmative Defenses, to which the Company filed Oppositions on July 24, 2023. The Company filed an Amended Answer, Amended Affirmative Defenses and Amended Counterclaims on March 25, 2024. On November 9, 2023, Ardagh filed a Notice of Plaintiff s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on Count II of the Complaint, to which the Company filed an Opposition on November 22, 2023. On February 26, 2024, the Court granted the Motion. On March 27, 2024, the Company filed a Motion to Clarify and to Reconsider the Court s decision. Following briefing by the parties, on June 17, 2024, the Court granted the Company's Motion to Reconsider, denied Ardagh's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, and vacated its February 26, 2024 Order. Although the Court has not yet set a final date, the Company anticipates that fact discovery will be closed in 2024. The Court has also not yet set a date for the close of expert discovery, summary judgment filings, or trial.

Net revenue. Net revenue increased by 3.9 million, or 0.6 , to 605.5 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 601.6 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of price increases of 11.2 million and lower returns of 3.2 million, partially offset by lower shipment volume of 11.4 million. 
 
 Volume. Total shipment volume decreased by 1.9 to 2,243,000 barrels for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 2,286,000 barrels for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023, reflecting decreases in the Company s Truly, Dogfish Head, Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, partially offset by increases in its Twisted Tea, Sun Cruiser and Hard Mountain Dew brands. 
 
 The Company believes distributor inventory as of September 28, 2024 averaged approximately five and a half weeks on hand which was slightly higher than the Company s target level of four to five weeks. The Company expects that distributor inventory will return to target levels during the fourth quarter. 
 
 Net revenue per barrel. Net revenue per barrel increased by 2.6 to 269.94 per barrel for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 263.14 per barrel for the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to price increases and lower returns.

Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold was 145.00 per barrel for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 143.01 per barrel for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. The 2024 increase in cost of goods sold of 1.99, or 1.4 per barrel was primarily due to increases in inventory obsolescence of 7.6 million, or 3.39 per barrel, and inflationary impacts of 3.5 million, or 1.56 per barrel, partially offset by contract renegotiations and recipe optimization savings of 6.3 million, or 2.81 per barrel. 
 
 Inflationary impacts of 3.5 million consist primarily of increased internal brewery costs of 1.8 million and increased material costs of 1.7 million. 
 
 Gross profit. Gross profit was 124.94 per barrel for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 120.13 per barrel for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The Company includes freight charges related to the movement of finished goods from its manufacturing locations to distributor locations in its advertising, promotional and selling expense line item. As such, the Company s gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities that classify costs related to distribution differently. 
 
 Advertising, promotional, and selling expenses. Advertising, promotional and selling expenses decreased by 4.6 million, or 3.0 , to 148.0 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 152.6 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreased freight to distributors of 2.8 million from improved efficiencies and lower volumes. Brand and selling costs decreased 1.8 million, primarily due to lower salaries and benefit costs. 
 
 Advertising, promotional and selling expenses were 24.4 of net revenue, or 65.98 per barrel, for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 25.4 of net revenue, or 66.74 per barrel, for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. This decrease per barrel is primarily due to advertising, promotional, and selling expenses decreasing at a higher rate than the decrease in shipments. The Company invests in advertising and promotional campaigns that it believes will be effective, but there is no guarantee that such investments will generate sales growth. 
 
 The Company conducts certain advertising and promotional activities in its distributors markets, and the distributors make contributions to the Company for such efforts. These amounts are included in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive operations as reductions to advertising, promotional and selling expenses. Historically, contributions from distributors for advertising and promotional activities have amounted to between 2 and 3 of net sales. The Company may adjust its promotional efforts in the distributors markets, if changes occur in these promotional contribution arrangements, depending on industry and market conditions. 
 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 1.6 million, or 3.7 , to 43.8 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 42.2 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023, primarily due increased professional fees. 
 
 Impairment of intangible assets. Impairment of intangible assets reflects a 42.6 million non-cash impairment charge recorded primarily for the Dogfish Head brand, taken as a result of the Company s annual impairment analysis as of September 1, 2024. The impairment determination was primarily based on the latest forecasts of brand performance which has been below projections made on the acquisition date. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company recorded an impairment charge of 16.4 million for the Dogfish Head brand. 
 
 Impairment of brewery assets. Impairment of brewery assets of 0.02 million decreased by 1.9 million from the comparable period of 2023, due to lower write-offs of equipment at Company-owned breweries. 
 
 Income tax provision. The Company's effective tax rate of 31.7 increased from 29.3 in the prior year. The increased effective tax rate is due to increased non-deductible compensation and the impact of the impairment charge which resulted in lower pre-tax income compared to the prior year.

The Company s material cash requirements include working capital needs, satisfaction of contractual commitments, stock repurchases, and investment in the Company s business through capital expenditures. 
 
 Cash decreased to 255.6 million as of September 28, 2024 from 298.5 million as of December 30, 2023, primarily reflecting repurchases of the Company's Class A common stock, a note receivable issued, purchases of property, plant, and equipment, and payments of tax withholdings on stock-based payment awards and investment shares, partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities consists of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and other non-cash items included in operating results, and changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and accrued expenses. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 was comprised of net income of 98.5 million and non-cash items of 118.4 million, partially offset by a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of 9.9 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023 was comprised of net income of 94.4 million, non-cash items of 94.7 million, and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of 43.3 million. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 is primarily due to lower inventory reduction compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher net income. 
 
 The Company used 72.7 million in investing activities during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 47.1 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in investing activity cash outflows is due to a 20.0 million note receivable issued. For both periods, capital investments were made mostly in the Company s breweries to drive efficiencies and cost reductions and support product innovation and future growth. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities was 177.1 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, as compared to 55.1 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 30, 2023. The 122.0 million increase in financing activity cash outflows in 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily due to higher repurchases of the Company's Class A common stock in the current period. 
 
 During the period from December 31, 2023 through October 18, 2024, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 647,728 shares of its Class A Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of 190.9 million. On October 2, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the share buyback expenditure limit set for the program from 1.2 billion to 1.6 billion. As of October 18, 2024, the Company had repurchased a cumulative total of approximately 14.7 million shares of its Class A Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 1.1 billion and had approximately 476 million remaining on the 1.6 billion stock repurchase expenditure limit set by the Board of Directors. 
 
 The Company expects that its cash balance as of September 28, 2024 of 255.6 million, along with its projected future operating cash flow and its unused line of credit balance of 150.0 million, will be sufficient to fund future cash requirements. The Company s 150.0 million credit facility has a term not scheduled to expire until December 16, 2027. As of the date of this filing, the Company was not in violation of any of its covenants to the lender under the credit facility.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Valuation of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets 
 
 The Company has recorded intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill for which impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. The Company performs its annual impairment tests and re-evaluates the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date in the third quarter of each fiscal year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment or change in useful life might exist. 
 
 Significant judgement is required to estimate the fair value of the Dogfish Head trademark. Accordingly, the Company obtains the assistance of third-party valuation specialists as part of the impairment evaluation. In estimating the fair value of the trademark, management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues, the market-based royalty rate, the discount rate, and the after-tax royalty savings expected from ownership of the trademark. The assumptions and projections used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with recent trends and represent the projections used in Company s current strategic operating plans which include reductions in revenues from the Dogfish Head beer products. These assumptions reflect management s estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and consider many factors including macroeconomic conditions, industry growth rates, and competitive activities and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company will change the indefinite useful life of the Dogfish Head trademark asset and begin amortizing the remaining 14.4 million balance over an estimated useful life of 10 years. 
 
 The Company performed a sensitivity analysis on its significant assumptions used in the Dogfish Head trademark fair value calculation and determined the following: 
 
 A decrease in the annual forecasted revenue growth rate of 1.0 would result in a 4.9 decrease to the current fair value of 14.4 million. 
 
 A decrease in the discount rate of 1.5 would result in a 8.3 increase to the current fair value of 14.4 million and an increase in the discount rate of 1.5 would result in a 6.9 decrease to the current fair value of 14.4 million.

 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, the Company conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively) regarding the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective as of September 28, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods and that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
