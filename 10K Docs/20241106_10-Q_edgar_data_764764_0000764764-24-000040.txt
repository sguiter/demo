 Finance leases 
 Revenues from finance leases were million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included in retail and wholesale finance revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Profit. 
 
 A. Allowance for credit losses 
 
 Portfolio segments 
 A portfolio segment is the level at which we develop a systematic methodology for determining our allowance for credit losses. Our portfolio segments and related methods for estimating expected credit losses are as follows: 
 
 Customer 
 We provide loans and finance leases to end-user customers primarily for the purpose of financing new and used Caterpillar machinery, engines and equipment for commercial use. We also provide financing for power generation facilities that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. The average original term of our customer finance receivable portfolio was approximately months with an average remaining term of approximately months as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We typically maintain a security interest in financed equipment and generally require physical damage insurance coverage on the financed equipment, both of which provide us with certain rights and protections. If our collection efforts fail to bring a defaulted account current, we generally can repossess the financed equipment, after satisfying local legal requirements, and sell it within the Caterpillar dealer network or through third-party auctions. 
 
 We estimate the allowance for credit losses related to our customer finance receivables based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default and our estimated loss given default based on past loss experience adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts capturing country and industry-specific economic factors. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our forecasts reflected a continuation of the trend of historically low unemployment rates as well as low delinquencies within our portfolio. However, industry delinquencies show an increasing trend as the central bank actions aimed at reducing inflation have weakened global economic growth. We believe the economic forecasts employed represent reasonable and supportable forecasts, followed by a reversion to long-term trends. 
 
 Dealer 
 We provide financing to Caterpillar dealers in the form of wholesale financing plans. Our wholesale financing plans provide assistance to dealers by financing their mostly new Caterpillar equipment inventory and rental fleets on a secured and unsecured basis. In addition, we provide a variety of secured and unsecured loans to Caterpillar dealers. 
 
 We estimate the allowance for credit losses for dealer finance receivables based on historical loss rates with consideration of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.

 B. Credit quality of finance receivables 
 
 At origination, we evaluate credit risk based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit ratings, loan-to-value ratios, probabilities of default, industry trends, macroeconomic factors and other internal metrics. On an ongoing basis, we monitor credit quality based on past-due status as there is a meaningful correlation between the past-due status of customers and the risk of loss. In determining past-due status, we consider the entire finance receivable past due when any installment is over days past due.

 Finance receivables in our Customer portfolio segment are substantially secured by collateral, primarily in the form of Caterpillar and other equipment. For those contracts where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, repayment of the outstanding amounts is generally expected to be provided through the operation or repossession and sale of the equipment.

 As of September 30, 2024 the total amortized cost of finance receivables within our Dealer portfolio segment was current.

 Modifications 
 We periodically modify the terms of our finance receivable agreements. Typically, the types of modifications granted are payment deferrals, interest only payment periods and/or term extensions. Many modifications we grant are for commercial reasons or for borrowers experiencing some form of short-term financial stress and may result in insignificant payment delays. We do not consider these borrowers to be experiencing financial difficulty. Modifications for borrowers we do consider to be experiencing financial difficulty typically result in payment deferrals and/or reduced payments for a period of or longer, term extension of or longer or a combination of both.

 finance receivable modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the Dealer or Caterpillar Purchased Receivables portfolio segments. The amortized cost basis of finance receivables modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in our Customer portfolio segment during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. Total modifications with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty represented percent and percent of the Customer portfolio for the same periods, respectively. The amortized cost basis of finance receivables modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in our Customer portfolio segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. Total modifications with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty represented percent and percent of the Customer portfolio for the same periods, respectively. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the financial effects of term extensions for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty added a weighted average of and months, respectively, to the terms of modified contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the financial effects of term extensions for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty added a weighted average of and months, respectively, to the terms of modified contracts. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the financial effects of payment delays for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty resulted in weighted average payment deferral and/or interest only periods of and months, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the financial effects of payment delays for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty resulted in weighted average payment deferral and/or interest only periods of and months, respectively. 
 
 After we modify a finance receivable, we continue to track its performance under its most recent modified terms. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, defaults of loans modified in the prior twelve months were not significant. 
 
 The effect of most modifications made to finance receivables for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses based on the methodologies used to estimate the allowance; therefore, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. On rare occasions when principal forgiveness is provided, the amount forgiven is written off against the allowance for credit losses.

 operating segments described below. Our operating segments provide financing alternatives to customers and dealers around the world for Caterpillar products and services and power generation facilities that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. Financing plans include operating and finance leases, revolving charge accounts, retail loans, working capital loans to Caterpillar dealers and wholesale financing plans within each of the operating segments. Certain operating segments also purchase short-term trade receivables from Caterpillar. 
 
 B. Description of Segments 
 
 We have operating segments that offer financing services. Following is a brief description of our segments: 
 
 North America - Includes our operations in the United States and Canada. 
 EAME - Includes our operations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Eurasia. 
 Asia/Pacific - Includes our operations in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Southeast Asia and India. 
 Latin America - Includes our operations in Mexico and Central and South American countries. 
 Mining - Provides financing for large mining customers worldwide. 
 Power - Provides financing worldwide for Caterpillar electrical power generation, gas compression and co-generation systems and non-Caterpillar equipment that is powered by these systems. 
 
 C. Segment Measurement and Reconciliations 
 
 Cash, debt and other expenses are allocated to our segments based on their respective portfolios. The related Interest expense is calculated based on the amount of allocated debt and the rates associated with that debt. The performance of each segment is assessed based on a consistent leverage ratio. The Provision for credit losses is based on each segment s respective finance receivable portfolio. Capital expenditures include expenditures for equipment on operating leases and other miscellaneous capital expenditures. 
 
 Reconciling items are created based on accounting differences between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. For the reconciliation of Profit before income taxes, we have grouped the reconciling items as follows: 
 
 Unallocated - Corporate requirements and strategies that are considered to be for the benefit of the entire organization. Also included are the consolidated results of the special-purpose corporation (SPC) (see Note 7 for additional information) and other miscellaneous items. 
 Timing - Timing differences in the recognition of costs between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. 
 Methodology - Methodology differences between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting are as follows: 
 Segment assets include off-balance sheet managed assets for which we maintain servicing responsibilities. 
 The impact of differences between the actual leverage and the segment leverage ratios. 
 Interest expense includes realized forward points on foreign currency forward contracts. 
 The net gain or loss from interest rate derivatives is excluded from segment reporting. 
 Divestiture - Loss on divestiture included in Other income (expense). See Note 10 for more information.

The assets of the SPC are not available to pay our creditors. We may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the SPC experiences losses. No loss has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement. 
 
 Litigation and claims 
 We are involved in unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

A loan is measured at fair value when management determines that collection of contractual amounts due is not probable and the loan is individually evaluated. In these cases, an allowance for credit losses may be established based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. We had loans carried at fair value of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 We reported third-quarter 2024 revenues of 888 million, an increase of 42 million, or 5 percent, compared with 846 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to a favorable impact from higher average earning assets of 34 million and a favorable impact from higher average financing rates of 23 million. Third-quarter 2024 profit was 137 million, an increase of 39 million, or 40 percent, compared with 98 million profit in the third quarter of 2023.

UNAUDITED 

Retail revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was 428 million, an increase of 50 million from the same period in 2023. The increase was due to a favorable impact from higher interest rates on retail finance receivables of 29 million and a favorable impact from higher average earning assets of 21 million. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, retail average earning assets were 23.41 billion, an increase of 1.15 billion from the same period in 2023. The annualized average yield was 7.31 percent for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 6.80 percent for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Operating lease revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was 235 million, an increase of 3 million from the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a favorable impact from higher rental rates on operating leases of 11 million, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets of 9 million. 
 
 Wholesale revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was 188 million, an increase of 4 million from the same period in 2023 driven by a favorable impact from higher average earning assets of 9 million, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from lower interest rates on wholesale finance receivables of 5 million. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, wholesale average earning assets were 5.59 billion, an increase of 168 million from the same period in 2023. The annualized average yield was 13.47 percent for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 13.56 percent for the third quarter of 2023.

Currency translation represents the net impact from converting the results of our subsidiaries to U.S. dollar reporting currency and is included in all financial statement line items. 
 
 Consolidated Profit Before Income Taxes 
 Third-quarter 2024 profit before income taxes was 182 million, an increase of 12 million, or 7 percent, compared with 170 million profit in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to lower provision for credit losses of 16 million. 
 
 There was an unfavorable impact from currency translation on profit before income taxes of 3 million in the third quarter of 2024. Currency translation represents the net impact from converting the results of our subsidiaries to U.S. dollar reporting currency and is included in all financial statement line items. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes for the third quarter of 2024 was 45 million compared with 72 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was due to a discrete tax expense of 27 million recorded in the third quarter of 2023 for the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings and the change in the reinvestment position of a non-U.S. subsidiary.

 Retail revenue for the first nine months of 2024 was 1.25 billion, an increase of 176 million from the same period in 2023. The increase was due to a favorable impact from higher interest rates on retail finance receivables of 123 million and a favorable impact from higher average earning assets of 53 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, retail average earning assets were 23.04 billion, an increase of 1.08 billion from the same period in 2023. The annualized average yield was 7.22 percent for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 6.51 percent for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Operating lease revenue for the first nine months of 2024 was 701 million, an increase of 29 million from the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a favorable impact from higher rental rates on operating leases of 34 million, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets of 6 million.

UNAUDITED 

 Wholesale revenue for the first nine months of 2024 was 541 million, an increase of 33 million from the same period in 2023. The increase was due to a favorable impact from higher average earning assets of 24 million and a favorable impact from higher interest rates on wholesale finance receivables of 9 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, wholesale average earning assets were 5.43 billion, an increase of 249 million from the same period in 2023.

 There was an unfavorable impact from currency translation on revenues of 7 million in the first nine months of 2024. Currency translation represents the net impact from converting the results of our subsidiaries to U.S. dollar reporting currency and is included in all financial statement line items and each of the items included in the above analysis. 
 
 Consolidated Profit Before Income Taxes 
 Profit before income taxes was 393 million for the first nine months of 2024, including a 210 million loss on divestiture of a non-U.S. entity. Excluding the loss on divestiture, profit before income taxes was 603 million, an increase of 24 million, or 4 percent, compared with 579 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a favorable impact from higher average earning assets of 42 million, the absence of prior year unfavorable currency impacts of 34 million, and an insurance settlement of 33 million. These favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase in general, operating and administrative expenses of 43 million and an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment of 36 million. 
 
 There was an unfavorable impact from currency translation on profit before income taxes of 2 million in the first nine months of 2024. Currency translation represents the net impact from converting the results of our subsidiaries to U.S. dollar reporting currency and is included in all financial statement line items and each of the items included in the above analysis. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes for the first nine months of 2024 was 151 million on 393 million profit before income taxes compared with 177 million on 579 million profit before income taxes for the first nine months of 2023. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was negatively impacted by the loss on divestiture of a non-U.S. entity with no related tax benefit. In addition, a discrete tax expense of 27 million was recorded in the first nine months of 2023 for the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings and the change in the reinvestment position of a non-U.S. subsidiary. 

FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND EQUIPMENT ON OPERATING LEASES

 New retail financing for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the prior year period due to higher volume in North America. New operating lease activity decreased mainly due to lower rentals of Caterpillar equipment in North America. New wholesale financing decreased slightly from the prior year due to lower purchases of trade receivables from Caterpillar.

 Total Managed Portfolio 
 We define total portfolio as Finance receivables, net plus Equipment on operating leases, net. We also manage and service receivables and leases that have been sold by us to third parties with limited or no recourse in order to mitigate our concentration of credit risk with certain customers. These assets are not available to pay our creditors. Total managed portfolio was as follows:

 Total Portfolio Metrics 
 At the end of the third quarter of 2024, past dues were 1.74 percent, compared with 1.96 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Total non-performing finance receivables, which represent finance receivables currently on non-accrual status, were 206 million and 199 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total non-performing finance receivables as a percentage of our finance receivables were less than 1 percent at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Write-offs, net of recoveries, were 27 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 9 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 was 255 million, or 0.87 percent of finance receivables, compared with 331 million, or 1.18 percent, as of December 31, 2023. The allowance is subject to an ongoing evaluation based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and economic forecasts. We believe our allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the remaining life of our finance receivable portfolio as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Global Business Conditions 
 Caterpillar continues to monitor a variety of external factors around the world, such as supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost and labor pressures. We are monitoring the potential downstream impacts from these factors on our business, while remaining focused on portfolio health and continuing to provide qualified customers and dealers with new loans and leases to support their current and future business needs.

 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 
 Maintaining and managing adequate capital and liquidity resources includes management of funding sources and their utilization based on current, future and contingent needs. Throughout the third quarter of 2024, we experienced favorable liquidity conditions. We ended the third quarter of 2024 with 707 million of cash, a decrease of 20 million from year-end 2023. Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with approximately 405 million held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Amounts held by non-U.S. subsidiaries are available for general corporate use and could be used in the U.S. without incurring significant additional U.S. taxes. We expect to meet our U.S. funding needs without repatriating undistributed profits that are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. 

Borrowings 
 Borrowings consist primarily of medium-term notes and commercial paper, the combination of which is used to manage interest rate risk and funding requirements. 
 
 We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. Fitch maintains a high-A debt rating, while Moody s and S P maintain a mid-A debt rating. A downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies could result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, we would rely on cash flows from our existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our committed credit facilities and other credit line facilities, and potential borrowings from Caterpillar. In addition, Caterpillar maintains a support agreement with us, which requires Caterpillar to remain our sole owner and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to us should we fail to maintain certain financial ratios. 
 
 Total borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024 were 29.23 billion, an increase of 952 million from December 31, 2023. Outstanding borrowings were as follows: 
 (Millions of dollars) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Medium-term notes, net 24,946 23,085 Commercial paper, net of unamortized discount 3,214 4,069 Bank borrowings and other long-term 550 527 Bank borrowings and other short-term 233 330 Variable denomination floating rate demand notes 278 244 Notes payable to Caterpillar 10 24 Total outstanding borrowings 29,231 28,279 
 
 Medium-term notes 
 We issue medium-term unsecured notes through securities dealers or underwriters in the U.S., Europe, and other international capital markets. These notes are offered in several currencies and with a variety of maturities. These notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. Medium-term notes issued totaled 7.36 billion and redeemed totaled 5.62 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Medium-term notes, net outstanding as of September 30, 2024 mature as follows:

UNAUDITED 

Medium-term notes of 200 million maturing in the fourth quarter of 2024 were excluded from Current maturities of long-term debt in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of September 30, 2024 due to a 200 million issuance of medium-term notes on October 4, 2024 which mature in 2026. The preceding maturity table reflects the reclassification of 200 million from maturities in 2024 to 2026. 
 
 Commercial paper 
 We issue unsecured commercial paper in the U.S., Europe and other international capital markets. These short-term promissory notes are issued on a discounted basis and are payable at maturity. As of September 30, 2024, there was 3.21 billion outstanding in commercial paper. 
 
 Revolving credit facilities 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling 10.50 billion (Credit Facility) available in the aggregate to both Caterpillar and us for general liquidity purposes. Based on management s allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility a vailable to us as of September 30, 2024 was 7.75 billion. Information on our Credit Facility is as follows: 
 
 In August 2024, we entered into a new 364-day facility. The 364-day facility of 3.15 billion (of which 2.33 billion is available to us) expires in August 2025. 
 In August 2024, we amended and restated the three-year facility (as amended and restated, the three-year facility ). The three-year facility of 2.73 billion (of which 2.01 billion is available to us) expires in August 2027. 
 In August 2024, we amended and restated the five-year facility (as amended and restated, the five-year facility ). The five-year facility of 4.62 billion (of which 3.41 billion is available to us) expires in August 2029. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, Caterpillar s consolidated net worth was 19.46 billion, which was above the 9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility. The consolidated net worth is defined in the Credit Facility as Caterpillar s consolidated shareholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.46 to 1. This was above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain (loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense, calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the prior four consecutive fiscal quarter periods, required by the Credit Facility. 
 
 In addition, at September 30, 2024, our six-month covenant leverage ratio was 6.77 to 1. This was below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility. 
 
 In the event that either Caterpillar or we do not meet one or more of our respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of our other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings. At September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. 
 
 The aforementioned financial covenants are being reported as calculated under the Credit Facility and not pursuant to U.S. GAAP. Please refer to the credit agreements governing the Credit Facility filed as an exhibit to our periodic reports for further information related to the calculation thereof. For risks related to our indebtedness and compliance with these covenants, please refer to the risk factor Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Bank borrowings 
 Available credit lines with banks as of September 30, 2024 totaled 3.64 billion. These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our non-U.S. subsidiaries for local funding requirements. We may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines. As of September 30, 2024, we had 781 million outstanding against these credit lines and were in compliance with all debt covenants under these credit lines.

Variable denomination floating rate demand notes 
 We obtain funding from the sale of variable denomination floating rate demand notes, which may be redeemed at any time at the option of the holder without any material restriction. We do not hold reserves to fund the payment of the demand notes. The notes are offered on a continuous basis. As of September 30, 2024, there were 278 million of variable denomination floating rate demand notes outstanding. The maximum amount of variable denomination floating rate demand notes that we may have outstanding at any time may not exceed 1.25 billion. 
 
 Notes receivable from/payable to Caterpillar 
 Under our variable amount and term lending agreements and other notes receivable with Caterpillar, we may borrow up to 2.26 billion from Caterpillar and Caterpillar may borrow up to 2.15 billion from us. Most variable amount lending agreements are in effect for indefinite periods of time and may be changed or terminated by either party with 30 days notice. The term lending agreements have remaining maturities ranging up to nine years. We had notes payable of 10 million and notes receivable of 506 million outstanding under these agreements as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily in the form of guarantees. Please refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 814 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 671 million for the same period in 2023. Net cash used for investing activities was 1.71 billion in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 1.03 billion for the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to portfolio-related activity and the divestiture of a non-U.S. entity. Net cash provided by financing activities was 876 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 123 million for the same period in 2023. The change was due to a higher net inflow from external borrowings and the absence of dividends paid to Caterpillar.
