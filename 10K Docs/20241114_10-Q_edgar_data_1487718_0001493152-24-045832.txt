 For
the Nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

. The
acquisition was driven by historical mineral data from seven (7) existing wells with brine aquifer access. The independent third-party
Technical Report indicated that further investment and development in the claims were warranted. 

On
April 25, 2023, the Company formed Mountain Sage Minerals, LLC, a Utah limited liability company, of which it is the owner. The
Company will look to expand its holdings in the Lisbon Valley area with the acquisition of additional mineral claims and joint venture
opportunities through this new LLC. 

On
May 1, 2023, FINRA completed the processing of our application for a name change, and our name was officially changed to American Battery
Materials, Inc. At the same time, the Company s trading symbol was changed to BLTH. These changes better reflect the business of
the Company. 

On
June 1, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Seaport Global Acquisition
II Corp., a Delaware corporation SGI I ), and Lithium Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary
of SGII Merger Sub ). SGII is a blank check company, also referred to as a special purpose acquisition company, formed
for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar
business combination with one or more businesses. Following material changes to the transaction proposed by SGII making the transaction
untenable to us, on November 20, 2023, SGII notified us that it had elected to terminate the Merger Agreement. 

. On August 1, 2023, the Company s unanimously approved the Reverse Split and authorized the filing of the Amendment. On December
8, 2023, the company effectuated the reverse split of the common stock by a ratio of one-for-300 (the Reverse Split ). All
per share amounts and number of shares in the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively restated to
reflect the Reverse Split. 

The
Company has been moving forward with its strategy of employing advanced brine extractive technology methodologies and has been in talks
with numerous extraction providers. Selective mineral extraction is clearly the most cost-effective and ESG friendly approach currently
available. Technologies are being utilized that can extract the desired minerals and metals from the brine and then re-inject the brines
back down into the aquifer. The prospective partners have been provided the analytical results from the technical reports, but will soon
provide current results, analytical, geotech modeling, aquifer modeling, recharge, flows and depth. 

during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, has accumulated losses totaling , and has a working capital deficit of 
 as of September 30, 2024. These factors, among
others, indicate that the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

Until
the Company can generate significant cash from operations, its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional
financing. The Company hopes to raise additional financing, potentially through the sale of debt or equity instruments, or a combination,
to fund its operations for the next 12 months and allow the Company to continue the development of its business plans and satisfy its
obligations on a timely basis. Should additional financing not be available, the Company will have to negotiate with its lenders to extend
the repayment dates of its indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully restructure its debt
obligations in the event it fails to obtain additional financing. These conditions have raised substantial doubt as to the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements, which has not been alleviated. 

. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are
charged to expense as incurred. 

. The Company acquired and staked additional lithium mining claims adjacent to its Lisbon Valley Project in Utah for .
The new claims have been registered with the Bureau of Land Management. The Company now owns a total of 743 placer claims over 
acres, comprised of (i) the 102 original claims held; and (ii) the 641 new claims. No impairment or capitalizable costs related to the
mineral claims were noted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

and shares respectively, potentially issuable
under convertible debt agreements, options, warrants and preferred stock that could dilute basic earnings per share if converted that
were excluded from the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive due to the
Company s net losses.

Overview
and Outlook 

We
are a U.S. based renewable energy company focused on the extraction, refinement and distribution of technical minerals in an environmentally
responsible manner. We formerly developed, marketed and distributed various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded
islands throughout North America. Due to the nationwide shutdown related to the Covid-19 pandemic, we spent a portion of 2020 restructuring
and retiring certain corporate debt and obligations and focusing on implementing a new operational direction. 

Through
the corporate reorganization and repositioning process, we found ourselves with the unique opportunity to acquire mining claims that
historically reported high levels of lithium and other technical minerals crucial to produce batteries used in many technology products
and markets. We hired and affiliated ourselves with industry veterans that bring decades of experience, credibility and relationships. 

On
November 5, 2021, we acquired the rights to 102 federal mining claims located in the Lisbon Valley of Utah for 100,000 plus the future
payment of royalties based on a percentage of the net revenue from the sale of lithium produced from a portion of the mining property.
The acquisition was driven by historical mineral data from seven existing wells with brine aquifer access. We are defined as an exploration
stage issuer, under SEC Regulation S-K Item 1300. An independent third-party technical report indicated that further investment and development
in the claims was warranted, although no determination has been made whether we have any reserves of minerals. Similarly, no determination
has been made whether mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted. We have no mineral reserves as defined
by Regulation S-K Item 1300 and have had no mining revenue to date. 

In
July 2023, we acquired and staked additional lithium mining claims adjacent to our Lisbon Valley Project in Utah. The new claims have
been registered with the BLM. We now own a total of 743 placer claims over 14,320 acres (approximately 22 square miles), comprised of
the 102 original mining claims and 641 new claims. 

On
April 25, 2023, we formed Mountain Sage Minerals, LLC, a Utah limited liability company. We plan to expand our holdings in the Lisbon
Valley area with the acquisition of additional mineral claims and joint venture opportunities through this entity. 

On
June 1, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Seaport Global Acquisition II
Corp. SGII and Lithium Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGII. SGII is a blank check company, also referred
to as a special purpose acquisition company, formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition,
stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. As a result of the Merger Agreement,
we would have become a wholly owned subsidiary of SGII. Following material changes to the transaction proposed by SGII making the transaction
untenable to us, on November 20, 2023, SGII notified us that it had elected to terminate the Merger Agreement. 

We
have been moving forward with our strategy of employing advanced brine extractive technology methodologies and have been in talks with
numerous extraction providers. Selective mineral extraction is the most cost-effective and ESG friendly approach currently available.
Technologies are being utilized that can extract the desired minerals and metals from the brine and then re-inject the brines back down
into the aquifer. The prospective partners have been provided the analytical results from the technical reports, but will soon provide
current results, analytical, geotech modeling, aquifer modeling, recharge, flows and depth. We will need funding to support continuing
operations and support our growth strategy and we will need to finance operations by offering any combination of equity offerings, debt
financing, collaborations, strategic alliances or other licensing arrangements. There is no assurance we will be able to raise sufficient
capital to finance our operations.

 2,165,494 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to a decrease in professional
fees. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023 the higher operating expenses were attributable to costs incurred for staking new claims
in Utah, exploration well permitting, development of technical reports and geological modeling, and legal fees associated with the SPAC
business combination

the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our company recorded a loss on settlement of liabilities of 516,083. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, our company recorded a gain on settlement of liabilities of 67,984, consisting of 7,008 in principal and
 60,976 in interest forgiven by creditors.

the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our company recorded a fair value of stock issued for note modification of 14,382. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a fair value of stock issued for note modification of 168,856. 

Extension
fees due to SPAC Sponsor 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded 101,662 of extension fees due to SPAC Sponsor. No such transactions were
noted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 295,572, as compared to 94,771 during the nine months ended September 30,
2023. 

Net
Loss 

As
a result of the foregoing, the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 2,041,882 as compared to the net loss of 2,462,799
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for capital expenditures. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. Our company had a net loss of 2,041,882 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, had accumulated losses totaling 22,281,521, and a working capital deficit of 5,236,132 as of
September 30, 2024. These factors, among others, indicate that our company may be unable to continue as a going concern. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

Since
we acquired our first mining claims in November 2021, we have faced an increasingly challenging liquidity situation that has limited
our ability to execute our operating plan. Our company will need to raise additional financing in order to fund its operations for the
next 12 months and to allow us to continue the development of its business plans and satisfy its obligations on a timely basis. Should
additional financing not be available, we will have to negotiate with its lenders to extend the repayment dates of its indebtedness.
There can be no assurance that our company will be able to successfully restructure its debt obligations in the event it fails to obtain
additional financing. 

Sources
of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements with third parties may include equity or debt financing,
bank loans or revolving credit facilities. We may not be successful in locating suitable financing transactions in the time period required
or at all and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means. Unless we can attract additional investment, our operating as
a going concern is in doubt. 

15 

If
we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, we may have to cease filing the required reports and cease operations
completely. If we obtain additional funds by selling any of our equity securities or by issuing common stock to pay current or future
obligations, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution, or the equity
securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the common stock. 

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our company used 585,876 of cash in operating activities as a result of our net loss of 2,041,882,
offset by loss on debt settlement of 516,083 and amortization of debt discount of 28,497, fair value of stock issued for note
modification of 14,382, share-based compensation of 14,261, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 882,783. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company used 1,911,600 of cash in operating activities as a result of the Company s
net loss of 2,462,799, increased by gain on debt settlement of 67,984 and amortization of debt discount of 89,876, and offset by fair
value of options issued for note modification of 168,856, share-based compensation of 446,113, and net changes in operating assets
and liabilities of 94,090.

the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our company had no investing activities.

the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company expended 106,000 for staking activities related to new federal mining claims located
in the Lisbon Valley of Utah. 

Cash

the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities provided 581,733 resulting from 135,000 in proceeds from convertible
notes and 671,733 in proceeds from promissory notes, offset by repayment of promissory notes of 225,000.

Amendments
to Outstanding Promissory Notes 

On
various dates from April 1 to April 8, 2024, with an effective date as of March 29, 2024, we entered into the following transactions
regarding our outstanding promissory notes: 

Pursuant
 to a Convertible Note Amendment Agreement with each of five investors holding convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount
 of 1,750,000 with accrued interest of 125,646, each of these investors agreed to (a) extend
 the maturity date of their note to the earlier of (i) September 30, 2024 or (ii) the closing of an uplisting transaction
 in which our common stock is traded on a national securities exchange and (b) impose a limitation on their conversions so that the
 investor will not effect a conversion under its note until the earlier of (i) the uplisting transaction closing or (ii) July 1, 2024. 

Pursuant
 to a Convertible Note Amendment Agreement with one investor holding a convertible note in the principal amount of 50,000 with accrued
 interest of 3,583, the investor agreed to: (a) extend the maturity date of its note to the earlier of (i) March 31, 2025 or (ii)
 the closing of an uplisting transaction in which our common stock is traded on a national securities exchange and (b) impose a limitation
 on its conversions so that the investor will not effect a conversion under its note until the earlier of (i) the uplisting transaction
 closing or (ii) the maturity date. 

Pursuant
 to a Promissory Note Amendment Agreement with one investor holding a promissory note in the
 principal amount of 25,000 with accrued interest of 2,971, the investor agreed to: (a) extend the maturity date of its note to
 the earlier of (i) March 31, 2025 or (ii) the closing of an uplisting transaction in which our common stock is traded on a national
 securities exchange and (b) impose a limitation on conversions so that the investor will not effect a conversion under its note until
 the earlier of (i) the uplisting transaction closing or (ii) the maturity date. 

In
consideration for the extensions of the maturity date and agreement not to convert their notes,
the principal amount due under each note was increased by 30 and the interest rate of each note was increased to 10 beginning on the
effective date of March 29, 2024. We negotiated the note amendments with the investors, all of whom are unaffiliated with our company,
on an arm s-length basis. As additional consideration for each note amendment, we also issued to the investors a total of 237,250
shares of our common stock on a pro rata basis.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

For
certain of our financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and
short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to our short maturities. ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures, requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by us. ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, 
defines fair value and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure
requirements for fair value measures. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows: 

Level
 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
 We consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume
 to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 

Level
 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially
 the full term of the asset or liability. This category includes those derivative instruments that we value using observable market
 data. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the term of the derivative instruments, can
 be derived from observable data, or supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. 

Level
 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less
 observable from objective sources (i.e. supported by little or no market activity). 

Derivative
Financial Instruments 

We
evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.
Certain warrants issued by us contain terms that result in the warrants being classified as derivative liabilities for accounting purposes.
For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair
market value and then is revalued at each reporting date, with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated statement of operations.
We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not
required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

David
Graber, who serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Sebastian Lux, who serves as our President and Chief Operating
Officer and Agustin Cabo, who serves as our Chief Financial Officer and Principal Financial Officer (collectively referred to herein
as Senior Management ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024.
The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Senior Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on its evaluation, Senior Management concluded as of September 30, 2024 that
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting: 

We
 do not have controls designed to validate the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the determination of accounting
 transactions. Accordingly, we believe we have a material weakness because there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
 to the interim or annual consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

We
 do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
 over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which is applicable to us. Management
 evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our
 disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represents a material weakness. 

We
 do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and
 nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent
 possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate
 individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls
 and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represents a material weakness. 

We
 have an inadequate number of personnel with requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. 

We
 do not have a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal
 controls and procedures. 

Notwithstanding
the identified material weaknesses, Senior Management believes the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods
presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. However, Senior Management
is currently seeking to improve our controls and procedures in an effort to remediate the deficiencies described above.
