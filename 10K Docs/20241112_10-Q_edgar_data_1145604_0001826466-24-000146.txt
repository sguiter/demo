 On February 12, 2024, the Company
signed an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger with Nika BioTechnology,
Inc. (OTCMKTS: NIKA). Pursuant to the Merger agreement Nika BioTechnology, Inc.,
(the Target company), was merged with and into the Company , the separate
corporate existence of the Target shall cease, and the Company shall continue as
the surviving consolidated entity. Nika BioTechnology, Inc., owned a 40 stake
in Nika Europe, Ltd. On October 11, 2022, the Company had acquired a 40 stake
in Nika Europe, Ltd., so as of April 12, 2024, the Company has an 80 
controlling interest in Nike Europe, through which the company will have a firm
foothold on the markets of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Nika Europe is preparing
the construction of a pharmaceutical factory that is comprised of different
manufacturing facilities for the production of drugs in injection, tablet and other forms. The factory will have enough production capacity to secure the needs of Nika. 
 On April 12, 2024, Nika Pharmaceuticals, Inc., through its subsidiary Nika Europe Ltd., acquired four technologies, three of which are for generic drugs and one for a dietary supplement. The technologies were purchased from Alliance for
 Intellectual Property in the Field of Pharmacy, Chemistry, and Biology AIPFPCB for a total price of 75,000 BGN (equivalent to around 42,491 USD) that was paid by Dimitar Slavchev Savov who is an officer and director of Nika
 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the general manager of Nika Europe, Ltd. With the trade names pending, the three technologies for drugs in tablet form are scientifically named as MENTHYL VALERATE 0.06g, METAMIZOLE SODIUM 500mg, VINPOCETINE 10mg, with the
 dietary supplement named as TRIBULUS TERRESTRIS HERBA EXTRACTUM SICCUM 250mg. 
 On April 23, 2024, Nika Europe, Ltd. signed a Supply Agreement with Shanghai Marya Pharmaceutical Engineering Project Co., Ltd. for the purchase, supply, and installation of a complete vial production line equipment adhering to Good
 Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards, costing 957,670. Dimitar Savov has paid the initial down payment of 191,534 from his personal money. The equipment is scheduled to be produced, delivered, and installed in the Bulgarian production
building by the end of Q4, 2024. 
 Effective April 29, 2024, Nika Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., a limited liability company registered in Bulgaria with UIC: 175420503, made a non-monetary in-kind contribution of a production building and land to the capital of Nika Europe, Ltd. The building
 and land were officially valued at 3,683,800 BGN 2,016,562) USD by three independent valuators appointed by the Bulgarian Registry Agency. As a result, the capital of Nika Europe, Ltd. was increased to 3,684,300 BGN. At the time of the
transaction, Dimitar Savov owned 100 of Nika Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. and was the company s general manager. 
 Effective May 6, 2024, the Company completed a voluntary symbol change from NKPH to NIKA, and will trade its common stock under NIKA from hereon. 
 Effective May 9, 2024, Nika Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquired 100 of Nika Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. The ownership was acquired from Dimitar Slavchev Savov for the nominal value of the capital of the company, 5,000 BGN. Simply put, with the May 9, 2024
 acquisition of Nika Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Nika Pharmaceuticals, Inc. now practically owns 99.99 in Nika Europe, Ltd. and becomes the beneficial owner of a factory building and land valued at 2,016,562 USD, situated in a strategic location in Sofia
 Province, which were originally purchased and renovated by Dimitar Savov at his own personal expense.

 was made effective on May 9, 2024 and disclosed via Form 8-K on May 10, 2024. The procedure to return the 100 to Dimitar Slavchev Savov, who is an officer and director of Nika Pharmaceluticals, Inc. and general manager of Nika Pharmaceuticals,
 Ltd., was initiated on August 19, 2024 and was made effective on August 23, 2024, resulting in Nika Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. no longer being a wholly owned subsidiary of Nika Pharmaceuticals, Inc. As a result, Nika Pharmaceuticals, Inc. no longer
practically owns 99.99 in Nika Europe, Ltd. and is no longer the beneficial owner of the factory building and land disclosed in the aforementioned Form 8-K dated May 10, 2024. 
 On September 11, 2024, Nika Pharmaceuticals, Inc. signed a production agreement with Nika Europe, Ltd., under which Nika Europe will produce ITV-1 for an estimated framework price of 580 per set once the pharmaceuticals factory is completed. In
this way, Nika Europe, Ltd. will organize and bear the costs of production for ITV-1, whilst Nika Pharmaceuiticals, Inc. will receive the same expected profit of around 1,120 per set that it has previously estimated.

 Going Concern 
 The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going
concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of
liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company currently has limited
operations and no revenue. If the Company cannot fulfill its business plan, the
Company may attempt to find a merger target in the form of an operating entity.
The Company cannot be certain that it will be successful in this strategy. 
 These factors, among others,
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 15 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have not entered into any
off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of
our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 
 We base our estimates on historical experience and on various
 other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the
 results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
 of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
 Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISKS. 
 Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls
 and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities
 Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act that are designed to be
 effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be
 disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms
 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and that such information
 is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions
 regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
 Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
 of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, they
 concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for the
quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. 
 The following aspects of the Company were noted as potential
 material weaknesses: 

lack of an audit committee 

lack of separation of duties
 
 In designing and evaluating
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also,
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 Based on that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that no change
occurred in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the
quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting.
