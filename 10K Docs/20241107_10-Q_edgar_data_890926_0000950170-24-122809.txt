The forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and the forward-looking statements, as well as our prospects as a whole, are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation:

the effects of the Enterprise Regulatory Capital Framework, finalized in February 2022, which establishes a new regulatory capital framework for the GSEs, and which, as finalized, increases the capital requirements for the GSEs, and among other things, could impact the GSEs operations and pricing as well as the size of the insurable mortgage market; 

changes in the current housing finance system in the United States, including the roles of the Federal Housing Administration (the FHA ), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VA ), the GSEs and private mortgage insurers in this system;

U.S. political conditions, which may be more volatile and present a heightened risk in Presidential election years, and legislative and regulatory activity (or inactivity), including adoption of (or failure to adopt) new laws and regulations, or changes in existing laws and regulations, or the way they are interpreted or applied;

the possibility that we may fail to estimate accurately, especially in the event of an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme market volatility and economic uncertainty, the likelihood, magnitude and timing of losses in establishing loss reserves for our mortgage insurance business or to accurately calculate and/or project our Available Assets and Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs, which could be impacted by, among other things, the size and mix of our IIF, future changes to the PMIERs, the level of defaults in our portfolio, the reported status of defaults in our portfolio (including whether they are subject to mortgage forbearance, a repayment plan or a loan modification trial period), the level of cash flow generated by our insurance operations and our risk distribution strategies;

reportable business segment Mortgage Insurance. Mortgage Insurance Our Mortgage Insurance segment provides credit-related insurance coverage, principally through private mortgage insurance on residential first-lien mortgage loans, as well as contract underwriting and other credit risk management solutions, to mortgage lending institutions and mortgage credit investors. We provide our mortgage insurance products and services through our wholly owned subsidiary, Radian Guaranty. Private mortgage insurance plays an important role in the U.S. housing finance system because it promotes affordable home ownership and helps protect mortgage lenders and mortgage investors, as well as other beneficiaries such as the GSEs, by mitigating default-related losses on residential mortgage loans. Generally, these loans are made to home buyers who make down payments of less than of the purchase price for their home or, in the case of refinancings, have less than equity in their home. Private mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of these low down payment loans in the secondary mortgage market, almost all of which are currently sold to the GSEs. Our total direct primary mortgage IIF and RIF were billion and billion , respectively, as of September 30, 2024, compared to billion and billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The GSEs and state insurance regulators impose various capital and financial requirements on Radian Guaranty. These include the PMIERs financial requirements, as well as Risk-to-capital and other risk-based capital measures and surplus requirements. Failure to comply with these capital and financial requirements may limit the amount of insurance that Radian Guaranty writes or may prohibit it from writing insurance altogether. The GSEs and state insurance regulators possess significant discretion regarding all aspects of Radian Guaranty s business. See Note 16 for additional information on PMIERs and other regulatory information. All Other We report on our other operating segments and business activities within an All Other category, which includes the results of our Mortgage Conduit, Title, Real Estate Services and Real Estate Technology businesses. See Note 4 for additional information about our Mortgage Insurance reportable segment and All Other business activities. Risks and Uncertainties In assessing the Company s current financial condition and developing forecasts of future operations, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to potential factors impacting our financial and liquidity position. These judgments and estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that could affect amounts reported in our financial statements in future periods and that could cause actual results to be materially different from our estimates.

reportable segment, Mortgage Insurance, which derives its revenue from mortgage insurance and other mortgage and risk services, including contract underwriting solutions provided to mortgage lending institutions and mortgage credit investors. In addition to this reportable segment, in All Other we report activities that include: (i) income (losses) from assets held by Radian Group, our holding company; (ii) related general corporate operating expenses not attributable or allocated to our reportable segment; and (iii) the operating results from certain other immaterial activities and operating segments, including our Mortgage Conduit, Title, Real Estate Services and Real Estate Technology businesses. We have reflected this change in our segment operating results for all periods presented, as shown below. We allocate corporate operating expenses to our Mortgage Insurance business and our immaterial operating businesses included in All Other based primarily on their respective forecasted annual percentage of total revenue, which approximates the estimated percentage of management time spent on each business. In addition, we allocate all corporate interest expense to our Mortgage Insurance segment, due to the capital-intensive nature of our mortgage insurance business. We do not manage assets by operating segments.

Adjusted Pretax Operating Income (Loss) Our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, uses adjusted pretax operating income (loss) as our primary measure to evaluate the fundamental financial performance of each of Radian s businesses and to allocate resources to them. Adjusted pretax operating income (loss) is defined as pretax income (loss) excluding the effects of: (i) net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments, except for those investments and other financial instruments attributable to our Mortgage Conduit business; (ii) amortization and impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets; and (iii) impairment of other long-lived assets and other non-operating items, if any, such as gains (losses) from the sale of lines of business, acquisition-related income (expenses) and gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for detailed information regarding items excluded from adjusted pretax operating income (loss), including the reasons for their treatment. Although adjusted pretax operating income (loss) excludes certain items that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, the excluded items represent those that are: (i) not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities or (ii) not expected to result in an economic impact equal to the amount reflected in pretax income (loss).

 Loaned Securities We participate in a securities lending program whereby we loan certain securities in our investment portfolio to third-party borrowers for short periods of time. Under this program, we had loaned million and million of our investment securities to third parties as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, including fixed-maturities, equity securities and short-term investments. Although we report such securities at fair value within other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, rather than within investments, the detailed information we provide in this Note 6 includes these securities. All of our securities lending agreements are classified as overnight and revolving. Securities collateral on deposit with us from third-party borrowers totaling million and million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, may not be transferred or re-pledged unless the third-party borrower is in default, and is therefore not reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements. See Note 5 herein for additional detail on the loaned securities and see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information about our accounting policies with respect to our securities lending agreements and the collateral requirements thereunder.

 million at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 , that are on deposit and serving as collateral with various state regulatory authorities. Our fixed-maturities available for sale also include securities serving as collateral for our FHLB advances. See Note 12 for additional information about our FHLB advances. 

 million and million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is based on fair value. The estimated fair value of our mortgage loans held for sale is subject to, among other things, changes in mortgage interest rates from the date we agree to purchase the mortgage loan through the date we agree to sell the mortgage loan. In an effort to mitigate this interest rate risk, we enter into certain derivative contracts with third parties during the period from the commitment to purchase the mortgage loans until the loans are either securitized or sold directly to mortgage investors. We elected the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans held for sale to allow for consistent treatment of both mortgage loans and any associated hedges or derivatives. Net gains (losses) associated with our mortgage loans held for sale and any related hedges are included in net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, our residential mortgage loans held for sale consisted of mortgage loans with a total unpaid principal balance of million , related to properties in states and the District of Columbia. Loans on properties in California accounted for of this balance, with no other state concentration exceeding as of September 30, 2024.

Net interest on residential mortgage loans held for sale 

In addition to the debt covenants under its financing facilities, Radian Mortgage Capital is also subject to certain requirements established by state and other regulators and loan purchasers, including Freddie Mac, such as certain minimum net worth and capital requirements and ratios. As of September 30, 2024, the most restrictive of these financial conditions required Radian Mortgage Capital to maintain a ratio of tangible net worth to total assets of at least . As of September 30, 2024, Radian Mortgage Capital s tangible net worth was million , compared to a required minimum tangible net worth of million based on this ratio. Changes in the fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges could materially impact Radian Mortgage Capital s net worth in future periods. To the extent any capital requirements are not met, regulators and loan purchasers may exercise certain remedies, which may include, as applicable, prohibiting Radian Mortgage Capital from purchasing, selling, or servicing loans. As of September 30, 2024, Radian Mortgage Capital was in compliance with all such requirements. Securitized Residential Mortgage Loans Held for Investment During the third quarter of 2024, Radian Mortgage Capital closed its inaugural private label prime jumbo securitization transaction. The securitization involved the transfer of a portfolio of residential mortgage loans to a newly created special purpose vehicle, Radian Mortgage Capital Trust 2024-J1, and the private offering and issuance of million of unregistered mortgage pass-through certificates collateralized by the cash flows of the underlying residential mortgage loans. At closing, we retained an interest in certain of the certificates, and Radian Mortgage Capital and its affiliates (excluding its mortgage insurance affiliates) may hold an interest in the certificates from time to time. Because this securitization consists entirely of qualified mortgages as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, pursuant to applicable federal securities laws and regulations, Radian Mortgage Capital is not obligated to retain these certificates for a minimum length of time as part of any risk retention requirements. We concluded that the special purpose vehicle created to facilitate this transaction is a VIE, primarily due to the minimal equity that the securitization trust holds to be able to finance its activities without additional support. In addition to being the sponsor and depositor for the trust, our involvement with this VIE is ongoing and includes retaining the subordinate certificates that are in a first loss position and maintaining certain discretionary rights associated with those subordinate investments, including certain rights to direct the loss mitigation activities of the servicer. As a result of our having both: (i) the economic obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE and (ii) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIE, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As a result, we consolidate the assets, liabilities, operations and cash flows of the securitization trust on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Since we were already carrying the loans transferred to the trust at fair value prior to the securitization, consistent with our policy election for all residential mortgage loans held for sale, we did not recognize any material gain or loss upon consolidation of the VIE. Despite being the primary beneficiary of the VIE and consolidating the trust s activities, the holders of the securitized debt have no recourse to the general credit of Radian and we neither own nor are liable for the assets and liabilities of the VIE. Rather, our exposure to these trusts is primarily through the risk of loss on the interests we have retained, as well as the obligation, under certain circumstances, for Radian Mortgage Capital to repurchase assets from the VIE upon the breach of certain representations and warranties with respect to the residential mortgage loans transferred to the VIE. Furthermore, liquidity available at the consolidated VIE is not available for corporate liquidity needs, other than through distributions on the certificates we have retained. We have elected the fair value option for the initial and subsequent recognition of the securitized residential mortgage loans and the related liabilities issued by the consolidated VIE. Electing this option allows us to record changes in fair value in 

 32 

Radian Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 million , which represents the aggregate fair value of our retained interests from the VIE, including accrued interest, as of that date. We report the net financial results from consolidated VIEs in income (loss) on consolidated VIEs in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, which also equals the income (loss) from our retained interests in any given period, based on the interest income and change in fair value for those interests. As of September 30, 2024, none of the loans in the securitization trust were greater than ninety days delinquent or in nonaccrual status.

Radian Mortgage Capital completed its second private label prime jumbo securitization in October 2024. This securitization involved the transfer of a portfolio of residential mortgage loans to a newly created VIE and the private offering and issuance of million of unregistered mortgage pass-through certificates collateralized by the cash flows of the underlying residential mortgage loans. At closing, we retained an interest in certain of the certificates, with an initial fair value of million. Based on our ongoing involvement with the VIE, we expect to consolidate the results of this newly created securitization trust. As part of our overall business strategy, we expect to continue to expand Radian Mortgage Capital s use of securitizations in the future. It is possible that we may consolidate additional VIEs in future periods, depending on the facts and circumstances regarding our involvement with each VIE. We continuously analyze entities in which we hold variable interests, including when there is a reconsideration event, to determine whether our consolidation conclusions regarding any VIE should change.

QSR Program 2024, 2023 and 2022 QSR Agreements Radian Guaranty entered into each of the 2024, 2023 and 2022 QSR Agreements with panels of third-party reinsurance providers to cede a contractual quota share percentage of certain of our NIW, which includes both Recurring Premium Policies and Single Premium Policies (as set forth in the table below), subject to certain conditions, including a limitation for the 2024 QSR Agreement on ceded RIF equal to billion over the term of the agreement. Radian Guaranty receives a ceding commission for ceded premiums earned pursuant to these transactions. Radian Guaranty is also entitled to receive a profit commission quarterly, subject to a final annual re-calculation, provided that the loss ratio on the loans covered under the agreements generally remains below the applicable prescribed thresholds. Losses on the ceded risk up to these thresholds reduce Radian Guaranty s profit commission on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

If Radian Guaranty exercises this option in the future, it would result in Radian Guaranty reassuming the related RIF in exchange for a net payment to the reinsurers calculated in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreement. Radian Guaranty also may terminate any of the agreements prior to the scheduled termination date under certain circumstances, including if one or both of the GSEs no longer grant full PMIERs credit for the reinsurance. 

XOL Program Mortgage Insurance-linked Notes Radian Guaranty has entered into fully collateralized reinsurance arrangements with the Eagle Re Issuers, as described below. For the respective coverage periods, Radian Guaranty retains the first-loss layer of aggregate losses, as well as any losses in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amounts. The Eagle Re Issuers provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding coverage amounts. For each of these reinsurance arrangements, the Eagle Re Issuers financed their coverage by issuing mortgage insurance-linked notes to eligible capital markets investors in unregistered private offerings. The aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage for these arrangements decreases over the maturity period of the mortgage insurance-linked notes (either a -year or -year period depending on the transaction) as the principal balances of the underlying covered mortgages decrease and as any claims are paid by the applicable Eagle Re Issuer or the mortgage

 or years after the issuance of the mortgage insurance-linked notes depending on the transaction) and a right to exercise an optional clean-up call if the outstanding principal amount of the related mortgage insurance-linked notes falls below of the initial coverage level or principal balance, depending on the transaction, of the related mortgage insurance-linked notes. Under each of the reinsurance agreements, the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount will begin amortizing after an initial period in which a target level of credit enhancement is obtained and will stop amortizing if certain thresholds, or triggers, are reached, including a delinquency trigger event based on an elevated level of delinquencies as defined in the related mortgage insurance-linked notes transaction agreements. Any remaining mortgage insurance-linked notes issued by Eagle Re 2020-1 Ltd. were paid in full in March 2024, with no material impact to the Company. As a result, Eagle Re 2020-1 Ltd. is no longer providing reinsurance coverage to Radian Guaranty. Traditional Reinsurance For the respective coverage periods under traditional XOL reinsurance agreements, Radian Guaranty retains the first-loss layer of aggregate losses, as well as any losses in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amounts. The reinsurers provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding coverage amounts. The 2023 XOL Agreement is scheduled to terminate September 30, 2033. Radian Guaranty has the option, based upon certain conditions, to terminate the agreement as of September 30, 2028, or at the end of any calendar quarter thereafter, which would result in Radian Guaranty reassuming the related RIF. In the event Radian Guaranty does not exercise its right to terminate the agreement on September 30, 2028, the monthly premium rate will increase from the original monthly premium.

Liabilities of the Eagle Re Issuers consist of their mortgage insurance-linked notes, as described above. Assets and liabilities are equal to each other for each of the Eagle Re Issuers. 

Other Collateral Although we use reinsurance as one of our risk management tools, reinsurance does not relieve us of our obligations to our policyholders. In the event the reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations to us, our insurance subsidiaries would be liable for any defaulted amounts. However, consistent with the PMIERs reinsurer counterparty collateral requirements, the third-party reinsurers to Radian Guaranty have established trusts to help secure our potential cash recoveries. In addition to the total VIE assets of the Eagle Re Issuers discussed above, the amount held in reinsurance trusts was million as of September 30, 2024, compared to million as of December 31, 2023. In addition, primarily for the Single Premium QSR Program, Radian Guaranty holds amounts related to ceded premiums written to collateralize the reinsurers obligations, which is reported in reinsurance funds withheld on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Any loss recoveries and profit commissions paid to Radian Guaranty related to the Single Premium QSR Program are expected to be realized from this account.

As a mortgage guaranty insurer, we are eligible for a tax deduction, subject to certain limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 832(e) for amounts required by state law or regulation to be set aside in statutory contingency reserves. The deduction is allowed only to the extent that, in conjunction with quarterly federal tax payment due dates, we purchase non-interest bearing U.S. Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from deducting any portion of our statutory contingency reserves.

Reserve Activity Incurred Losses Total incurred losses are driven by: (i) case reserves established for new default notices, which are primarily impacted by both the number of new primary default notices received in the period and our related gross Default to Claim Rate and Claim Severity assumptions applied to those new defaults and (ii) reserve developments on prior period defaults, which are primarily impacted by changes to our prior Default to Claim Rate and Claim Severity assumptions applied to these loans. New primary default notices totaled for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of . We believe this increase in new primary defaults is mainly due to the natural seasoning of our insured portfolio given the increase in our IIF in recent years and not the result of deteriorating credit performance of the insured portfolio. Our gross Default to Claim Rate assumption applied to new defaults was as of both September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, based on our review of trends in Cures and claims paid for our default inventory and taking into consideration the risks and uncertainties associated with the current economic environment.

Senior Notes Senior Notes due 2029. In March 2024, we issued million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2029 and received net proceeds of million. These notes mature on May 15, 2029, and bear interest at a rate of per annum, payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, with interest payments commencing on November 15, 2024. We have the option to redeem these notes, in whole or in part, at any time, or from time to time, prior to April 15, 2029 (the date that is one month prior to the maturity date of the notes) (the Par Call Date ), at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) the make-whole amount, which is the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect of the notes to be redeemed discounted to the redemption date (assuming the Senior Notes due 2029 matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable treasury rate plus basis points less interest accrued to the redemption date, and (b) of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time on or after the Par Call Date, we may, at our option, redeem the notes in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. The indenture governing the Senior Notes due 2029 contains covenants customary for securities of this nature, including covenants related to the payments of the notes, reports to be provided, compliance certificates to be issued and the ability to modify the covenants. Additionally, the indenture includes covenants restricting us from encumbering the capital stock of a designated subsidiary (as defined in the indenture for the notes) or disposing of any capital stock of any designated subsidiary unless either all of the stock is disposed of for cash or property which is at least equal to the fair market value of the stock or we retain more than of the stock. Extinguishment of Debt Redemption of Senior Notes due 2025. In March 2024, we exercised our right to redeem all of our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025 in the aggregate principal amount of million, at a redemption price of of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. We funded the redemption with million in cash (which included accrued and unpaid interest due on the redeemed notes). This redemption resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, which is included in interest expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Redemption of Senior Notes due 2024. In September 2024, we redeemed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of million of our outstanding Senior Notes due 2024. We funded the redemption with million in cash (which included accrued and unpaid interest due on the redeemed notes). Following these redemptions, there were remaining principal amounts outstanding on the Senior Notes due 2025 or the Senior Notes due 2024 at September 30, 2024.

Mortgage Loan Financing Facilities Radian Mortgage Capital has entered into the Master Repurchase Agreements to finance the acquisition of residential mortgage loans and related mortgage loan assets. Pursuant to the Master Repurchase Agreements, Radian Mortgage Capital may from time to time sell, and later repurchase, certain residential mortgage loan assets. The maximum borrowing amounts under the JP Morgan Master Repurchase Agreement, the Goldman Sachs Master Repurchase Agreement and the BMO Master Repurchase Agreement are million million and million , respectively. The JP Morgan Master Repurchase Agreement, the Goldman Sachs Master Repurchase Agreement and the BMO Master Repurchase Agreement are currently scheduled to expire on January 27, 2025, May 31, 2025 and September 24, 2025, respectively. The borrowings under the Master Repurchase Agreements bear a variable interest rate based on one-month SOFR or compounded SOFR, depending on the agreement, plus an applicable margin, with interest payable monthly. Principal is due upon the earliest of the sale or disposition of the related mortgage loans, the occurrence of certain default or acceleration events or at the termination date of the applicable Master Repurchase Agreement. Funds advanced under the Master Repurchase Agreements generally will be calculated as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance or fair value of the residential mortgage loan assets, depending on the credit characteristics of the loans being purchased. Of our residential mortgage loans held for sale, million and million served as collateral for the Master Repurchase Agreements to support the funds advanced at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Share Repurchase Activity From time to time, Radian Group s board of directors approves share repurchase programs authorizing the Company to repurchase Radian Group common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, based on market and business conditions, stock price and other factors. Radian generally operates its share repurchase programs pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, which provides for share repurchases at predetermined price targets and permits the Company to purchase shares when it may otherwise be precluded from doing so. In January 2023, Radian Group s board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to spend up to million , excluding commissions, to repurchase Radian Group common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, based on market and business conditions, stock price and other factors. In May 2024, Radian Group s board of directors approved an extension of the duration of this program to June 2026, as well as a million increase in authorization for this program, bringing the total authorization to repurchase shares up to million , excluding commissions. Radian has implemented a trading plan for this share repurchase program under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased million and million shares at an average price of and per share, including commissions, respectively, pursuant to the share repurchase program.

For performance-based awards, the final number of RSUs distributed depends on: (i) the cumulative growth in Radian s book value per share adjusted for certain defined items over the respective performance period and, for the performance-based RSUs granted in 2023 and 2024, a modifier based on a comparison of our total shareholder return to the total shareholder return of certain of our peers and (ii) with the exception of certain retirement-eligible employees, continued service through the vesting date, which could result in changes to the number of vested RSUs. 

 (2) For performance-based RSUs, amount represents the number of target shares at grant date. 

 (3) For performance-based RSUs, amount represents the difference between the number of shares vested at settlement, which can range from to of target depending on results over the applicable performance periods, and the number of target shares at the grant date. 

 (4) Represents amounts vested during the period, including the impact of performance adjustments for performance-based awards.

Radian Title Insurance 

Under state insurance regulations, Radian Guaranty is required to maintain minimum surplus levels and, in certain states, a maximum ratio of net RIF relative to statutory capital, or Risk-to-capital. The most common Statutory RBC Requirement is that a mortgage insurer s Risk-to-capital may not exceed to 1. In certain of the RBC States, a mortgage insurer must satisfy an MPP Requirement. Radian Guaranty was in compliance with all applicable Statutory RBC Requirements and MPP Requirements in each of the RBC States as of September 30, 2024 . Radian Guaranty s Risk-to-capital was :1 and :1 as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. For purposes of the Risk-to-capital requirements imposed by certain states, statutory capital is defined as the sum of statutory policyholders surplus plus statutory contingency reserves. Our other mortgage insurance and title insurance subsidiaries were also in compliance with all statutory and counterparty capital requirements as of September 30, 2024. In addition, in order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty must meet the GSEs eligibility requirements, or PMIERs. At September 30, 2024, Radian Guaranty, an approved mortgage insurer under the PMIERs, was in compliance with the current PMIERs financial requirements. State insurance regulations include various capital requirements and dividend restrictions based on our insurance subsidiaries statutory financial position and results of operations. As of September 30, 2024, the amount of restricted net assets held by our consolidated insurance subsidiaries (which represents our equity investment in those insurance subsidiaries) totaled billion of our consolidated net assets. While all proposed dividends and distributions to stockholders must be filed with the Pennsylvania Insurance Department prior to payment, if a Pennsylvania domiciled insurer has positive unassigned surplus, such insurer can pay dividends or other distributions during any 12-month period in an aggregate amount less than or equal to the greater of: (i) 10 of the preceding year-end statutory policyholders surplus or (ii) the preceding year s statutory net income, in each case without the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. Based on its positive unassigned surplus balances during the first nine months of 2024, Radian Guaranty paid ordinary dividends totaling million to Radian Group in the first nine months of 2024. Subsequent to the payment of these dividends, as of September 30, 2024, Radian Guaranty had positive unassigned surplus of million .

Over view 
 We are a mortgage and real estate company with one reportable business segment Mortgage Insurance. 
 Our Mortgage Insurance segment aggregates, manages and distributes U.S. mortgage credit risk for the benefit of mortgage lending institutions and mortgage credit investors, principally through private mortgage insurance on residential first-lien mortgage loans, and also offers other credit risk management solutions, including contract underwriting, to our customers. 
 Our other immaterial businesses are reported collectively as All Other and include our Mortgage Conduit, Title, Real Estate Services and Real Estate Technology businesses, which provide our existing and new customers with an array of products and services across the residential real estate and mortgage finance industries. 
 Current Operating Environment 
 As a mortgage and real estate company, our business results are subject to seasonal fluctuations impacting mortgage and real estate markets as well as macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the housing, housing finance and residential real estate markets and the credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio. Among others, these factors may include home prices and housing supply, inflationary pressures, interest rate changes, unemployment levels, the volume of mortgage originations and the availability of credit, national and regional economic conditions, legislative and regulatory developments and other events, including macroeconomic stresses and uncertainties resulting from global conflicts and other political and geopolitical events. 
 47 

Part I. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Consistent with the trends observed in recent periods, the economic and market conditions impacting our results for the first nine months of 2024 remained generally favorable. The current interest rate environment has benefited our Persistency Rates and net investment income yields, however, it has also contributed to reduced refinance volumes and NIW in our Mortgage Insurance business and lower transaction volumes for certain of our other businesses. 
 Private mortgage insurance industry volumes are impacted by total mortgage origination volumes and the mix between mortgage originations that are for home purchases versus refinancings of existing mortgages. Although it is difficult to project future volumes, recent industry forecasts project a total mortgage origination market for 2024 of approximately 1.7 trillion, which would represent an increase of approximately 17 compared to 2023, but a reduction compared to projections at the beginning of 2024. This decrease in projections for 2024 primarily relates to a change in the timing of interest rate decreases compared to expectations at the beginning of the year. The U.S. Federal Reserve reduced benchmark interest rates for the first time in approximately three years in September 2024, which was later than originally anticipated. The timing and magnitude of changes in the benchmark interest rate can affect mortgage interest rates and the overall size of the mortgage market . In light of updated projections, we now estimate that the private mortgage insurance market will be approximately 300 billion in 2024, which is the lower end of our expectations at the beginning of the year. In Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K, see A decrease in the volume of mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new mortgage insurance business and conduct our homegenius businesses for more information. 
 While these macroeconomic conditions are expected to negatively impact the overall volume of mortgage transactions taking place, the higher interest rate environment is expected to continue to benefit our financial performance through elevated Persistency Rates, which is expected to benefit our level of IIF despite lower NIW, as well as through the recognition of higher net investment income. Further, the housing supply continues to be constrained, which we believe will continue to support home values and the high level of home price appreciation currently embedded in our insured portfolio of mortgages. We expect this will continue to benefit the credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio as a result of the increased level of embedded equity borrowers have in their homes, which has positively impacted our default and cure trends. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Current Operating Environment in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional discussion of the primary factors affecting the current operating environment for our businesses. 
 Despite risks and uncertainties, we believe that mortgage industry fundamentals remain strong, including as a result of the improvements to the mortgage and real estate ecosystem since the great financial crisis in 2008, such as more stringent underwriting and product standards, higher-quality borrowers with strong credit profiles and strengthened mortgage loan servicing and government support to help borrowers stay in their homes. 
 Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
 We are subject to comprehensive regulation by both federal and state regulatory authorities. For a description of significant state and federal regulations and other requirements of the GSEs that are applicable to our businesses, as well as legislative and regulatory developments affecting the housing finance industry, see Item 1. Business Regulation in our 2023 Form 10-K. Except as discussed below, there were no significant regulatory developments impacting our businesses from those discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 On August 21, 2024, the GSEs issued updates to the PMIERs PMIERs Updates that refine the standards for Available Assets under the PMIERs, which include the most liquid assets of a mortgage insurer available to pay claims. While the PMIERs do not prohibit a mortgage insurer from holding any type of assets, the PMIERs Updates further limit the Available Asset credit that mortgage insurers receive under the PMIERs for certain asset types based on several factors, including, among others, asset class and credit rating. Under the PMIERs Updates, the impact of reductions in Available Asset credit resulting from the changes is being phased-in over a two-year period, with 25 of the calculated adjustment to be implemented as of March 31, 2025, 50 as of September 30, 2025, 75 as of March 31, 2026, and 100 as of September 30, 2026. We do not expect the PMIERs Updates to have a material impact on Radian Guaranty s capital position, its PMIERs cushion or its investment portfolio asset allocation strategy. 
 As part of the PMIERs Updates, the GSEs also announced that because the COVID-19 national emergency has ended, it would be eliminating the allowance for a reduction of the Minimum Required Asset factor under the PMIERs for COVID-19 Defaulted Loans. Effective March 31, 2025, COVID-19 Defaulted Loans will no longer qualify for the Disaster Related Capital Charge and will instead revert to the standard non-performing loan requirements of PMIERs. Although the Disaster Related Capital Charge is being eliminated for COVID-19 Defaulted Loans, it will continue to be available and apply to non-performing

 loans backed by a property located in a FEMA Designated Area, subject to certain conditions, including FEMA Designated Areas associated with the recent hurricanes Beryl, Helene and Milton. As of the effective date of March 31, 2025, we expect the elimination of the Disaster Related Capital Charge for COVID-19 Defaulted Loans to increase Radian Guaranty s Minimum Required Assets by an immaterial amount. 
 See Management s Discussion and Analysis Liquidity and Capital Resources Mortgage Insurance for more information. 
 Key Factors Affe cting Our Results 
 The key factors affecting our results are discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to these key factors. 
 Mortgage Ins urance Portfolio 
 New Insurance Written 
 We wrote 13.5 billion and 38.9 billion of primary new mortgage insurance in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 13.9 billion and 42.1 billion of NIW in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Our NIW decreased by 3 and 8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, due to a decline in private mortgage insurance penetration as a percentage of the overall mortgage origination market. According to industry estimates, total mortgage origination volume was higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the comparable periods in 2023, due primarily to a small increase in mortgage refinance activity. 
 The following table provides selected information for the periods indicated related to our mortgage insurance NIW. For direct Single Premium Policies, NIW includes policies written on an individual basis (as each loan is originated) and on an aggregated basis (in which each individual loan in a group of loans is insured in a single transaction, typically after the loans have been originated).

Our IIF is the primary driver of the future premiums that we expect to earn over time. IIF increased to 274.7 billion at September 30, 2024, from 270.0 billion at December 31, 2023, reflecting the impact of our NIW offset by policy cancellations and amortization for the first nine months of 2024. Our IIF at September 30, 2024, increased 2 as compared to the same period last year. 
 Historically, there is a close correlation between interest rates and Persistency Rates. Higher interest rate environments generally decrease refinancings, which decrease the cancellation rate of our insurance and positively affect our Persistency Rates. As shown in the table below, our 12-month Persistency Rate at September 30, 2024, increased as compared to September 30, 2023. The increase in our Persistency Rate at September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to decreased refinance activity due to increases in mortgage interest rates, as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 70 of our IIF had a mortgage note interest rate of 6.0 or less. Given the higher prevailing market mortgage interest rates, which, based on reported industry averages, now exceed these levels, we would expect a continued positive impact on our Persistency Rates. If refinance volume increases, we would expect the Persistency Rate for our portfolio to decrease, reducing the size of our IIF portfolio. See If the length of time that our mortgage insurance policies remain in force declines, it could result in a decrease in our future revenues under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information. 
 Throughout this report, unless otherwise noted, RIF is presented on a gross basis and includes the amount ceded under reinsurance. RIF and IIF for direct Single Premium Policies include policies written on an individual basis (as each loan is originated) and on an aggregated basis (in which each individual loan in a group of loans is insured in a single transaction, typically after the loans have been originated).

Risk Distribution 
 We use third-party reinsurance in our mortgage insurance business as part of our risk distribution strategy, including to manage our capital position and risk profile. When we enter into a reinsurance agreement, the reinsurer receives a premium and, in exchange, insures an agreed-upon portion of incurred losses. While these arrangements reduce our earned premiums, they also reduce our required capital and are expected to increase our return on required capital for the related policies. 
 The impact of these programs on our financial results will vary depending on the level of ceded RIF, as well as the levels of prepayments and incurred losses on the reinsured portfolios, among other factors. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Factors Affecting Our Results Mortgage Insurance Risk Distribution in our 2023 Form 10-K and Note 8 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for more information about our reinsurance transactions.

Revenues 
 Net Premiums Earned. Net premiums earned increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to: (i) an increase in direct premiums earned in 2024 and (ii) increased ceded premiums earned associated with the tender offers by Eagle Re 2019-1 Ltd. and Eagle Re 2020-1 Ltd. in the second quarter of 2023 to purchase the mortgage insurance-linked notes that supported their reinsurance agreements with Radian Guaranty. See Results of Operations Mortgage Insurance Revenues Net Premiums Earned for more information. 
 Net Investment Income. The increase in net investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, is primarily attributable to higher balances of residential mortgage loans held for sale and short-term investments. See Note 6 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for comparative detail about net investment income. See Results of Operations Mortgage Insurance Revenues Net Investment Income and Results of Operations All Other for more information.

 Net Gains (Losses) on Investments and Other Financial Instruments. See Note 6 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for comparative detail about net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments by investment category. 
 Expenses 
 Provision for Losses. The change in the provision for losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, is primarily driven by a reduction in favorable development on prior period defaults, which impacted our mortgage insurance reserves. See Results of Operations Mortgage Insurance Expenses Provision for Losses for more information. 
 Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by a 10 million impairment of internal-use software, partially offset by decreases in other operating expense for the businesses that comprise All Other activities. For additional information, see Expenses Other Operating Expenses under both Results of Operations Mortgage Insurance and Results of Operations All Other. 
 Interest Expense. The increase in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, is primarily due to: (i) an increase in secured borrowings under our mortgage loan financing facilities and (ii) the net impact of the March 2024 issuance and redemption of the Senior Notes due 2029 and Senior Notes due 2025, respectively, including the impact of a 4 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of the Senior Notes due 2025. See Note 12 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail about our interest expense. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 Our provision for income taxes for interim periods is established based on our estimated annual effective tax rate for a given year and reflects the impact of discrete tax effects in the period in which they occur. 
 Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 22.3 and 21.6 , respectively, as compared to 22.1 and 21.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effects of non-deductible executive compensation expense, state income taxes and the vesting of RSUs were the primary drivers of the difference in our effective tax rate compared to the federal statutory rate. 
 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to traditional GAAP financial measures, we have presented adjusted pretax operating income (loss), adjusted diluted net operating income (loss) per share and adjusted net operating return on equity, which are non-GAAP financial measures for the consolidated company, among our key performance indicators to evaluate our fundamental financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures align with the way our business performance is evaluated by both management and by our board of directors. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purposes of evaluating our operating trends and enabling more meaningful comparisons with our peers. Although on a consolidated basis adjusted pretax operating income (loss), adjusted diluted net operating income (loss) per share and adjusted net operating return on equity are non-GAAP financial measures, for the reasons discussed above we believe these measures aid in understanding the underlying performance of our operations. 
 Total adjusted pretax operating income (loss), adjusted diluted net operating income (loss) per share and adjusted net operating return on equity are not measures of overall profitability, and therefore should not be considered in isolation or viewed as substitutes for GAAP pretax income (loss), diluted net income (loss) per share or return on equity. Our definitions of adjusted pretax operating income (loss), adjusted diluted net operating income (loss) per share and adjusted net operating return on equity, as discussed and reconciled below to the most comparable respective GAAP measures, may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies. 
 Our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Radian s chief operating decision maker), uses adjusted pretax operating income (loss) as our primary measure to evaluate the fundamental financial performance of the Company s business segments and to allocate resources to the segments. For detailed information regarding items excluded from adjusted pretax operating income (loss) and the reasons for their treatment, see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial

 Statements and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Consolidated Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, each in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Adjusted pretax operating income (loss) is defined as GAAP consolidated pretax income (loss) excluding the effects of: (i) net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments, except for those investments and other financial instruments attributable to our Mortgage Conduit business; (ii) amortization and impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets; and (iii) impairment of other long-lived assets and other non-operating items, if any, such as gains (losses) from the sale of lines of business, acquisition-related income (expenses) and gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt.

(1) Related to defaulted loans with the most recent default notice dated in the period indicated. For example, if a loan had defaulted in a prior period, but then subsequently cured and later re-defaulted in the current period, the default would be considered a current period default. 

(2) Related to defaulted loans with a default notice dated in a period earlier than the period indicated, which have been continuously in default since that time. 

(3) Provision for losses as a percentage of net premiums earned. See Revenues Net Premiums Earned above for additional information on the changes in net premiums earned. 

(4) Calculated by dividing provision for losses for new defaults, net of reinsurance, by new primary defaults for each period. 

Current period new primary defaults increased by 23 and 16 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, as shown below, which is consistent with the natural seasoning of the portfolio given the increase in our IIF in recent years. Our gross Default to Claim Rate assumption for new primary defaults was 8.0 at both September 30, 2024 and 2023, as we continue to closely monitor the trends in Cures and claims paid for our default inventory, while also weighing the risks and uncertainties associated with the current economic environment. 
 Our provision for losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the same periods in 2023, was positively impacted by favorable reserve development on prior period defaults, primarily as a result of more favorable trends in Cures than originally estimated. These Cures have been due primarily to favorable outcomes resulting from positive trends in home price appreciation, which has also contributed to a higher rate of claims that result in no ultimate loss and that are withdrawn by servicers as a result. These favorable observed trends resulted in reductions in our Default to Claim Rate and other reserve adjustments for prior year default notices, including our Claim Severity assumptions in 2024. 
 See Note 11 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information, as well as Notes 1 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Our primary default rate as a percentage of total insured loans at September 30, 2024, was 2.3 compared to 2.2 at December 31, 2023. The following table shows a rollforward of our primary loans in default.

We develop our Default to Claim Rate estimates based primarily on models that use a variety of loan characteristics to determine the likelihood that a default will reach claim status. Our aggregate weighted average net Default to Claim Rate assumption for our primary loans used in estimating our reserve for losses, which is net of estimated Claim Denials and Rescissions, was 25 as of both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional details about our Default to Claim Rate assumptions. 
 Although expected claims are included in our reserve for losses, the timing of claims paid is subject to fluctuation from quarter to quarter based on the rate that defaults cure and other factors, including the impact of foreclosure moratoriums (as described in Item 1. Business Mortgage Insurance Defaults and Claims in our 2023 Form 10-K) that make the timing of paid claims difficult to predict.

Hurricanes Helene and Milton made landfall in September and October 2024, respectively, causing extensive property damage in Florida and certain other states, as well as other general disruptions including power outages and flooding. Although the Primary Mortgage Insurance we write protects lenders from a portion of losses resulting from mortgage defaults, it generally does not provide protection against property loss or physical damage, including damage caused by hurricanes or other severe weather events or natural disasters. As a result, while we expect new defaults from the affected areas to increase in the fourth quarter of 2024, absent a prolonged negative impact on the local economies in these areas, as of September 30, 2024, we do not expect to incur any material losses due to current or future defaults in FEMA Designated Areas related to these hurricanes. 
 For additional information about our reserve for losses, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Other Operating Expenses. The increase in other operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, is primarily due to an increase in variable and share-based compensation expense and severance related expense, partially offset by a reduction in general operating expenses related to expense savings actions implemented during the past year, as well as an increase in the benefit from ceding commissions under Radian Guaranty s QSR Program. 
 Share-based compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, includes 8 million of costs recognized on RSUs granted to retirement eligible grantees during the second quarter of 2024, as compared to 3 million for the same periods in 2023. Because no further service is required from retirement eligible grantees to satisfy vesting conditions for their awards, we recognize the full compensation costs as of the grant date for retirement eligible grantees. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information about our share-based compensation programs.

Part I. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Operating Activities. Our most significant source of operating cash flows is from premiums received from our mortgage insurance policies, while our most significant uses of operating cash flows are typically for our operating expenses and claims paid on our mortgage insurance policies and taxes. In addition, our operating activities also include Radian Mortgage Capital s purchases, sales and principal payments from residential mortgage loans held for sale, which can fluctuate from period to period. The increase in cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash provided by operating activities in the same period in 2023, is primarily due to increases in net purchases of mortgage loans held for sale, which increased from 137 million in the first nine months of 2023 to 849 million for the same period in 2024. 
 Investing Activities. Net cash provided by investing activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash used in investing activities in the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily from: (i) sales and redemptions, net of purchases, of short-term investments and fixed-maturities available for sale and (ii) cash provided by operating activities other than net cash used for purchases of mortgage loans held for sale, which were primarily funded by financing activities as described below. 
 Financing Activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our primary financing activities impacting cash included an increase in secured borrowings, primarily related to funding from mortgage loan financing facilities, which increased from 120 million in the first nine months of 2023 to 473 million for the same period in 2024, as well as proceeds from the issuance of securitized nonrecourse debt in 2024. This increase was partially offset by: (i) net changes in our senior notes; (ii) repurchases of our common stock; and (iii) payment of dividends. See Notes 12 and 14 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our borrowings and share repurchases, respectively. 
 See Item 1. Financial Statements (Unaudited) Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Unaudited) for additional information. 
 Liquidity Analysis Holding Company 
 Radian Group serves as the holding company for our operating subsidiaries and does not have any operations of its own. At September 30, 2024, Radian Group had available, either directly or through unregulated subsidiaries, unrestricted cash and liquid investments of 844 million. Available liquidity at September 30, 2024, excludes certain additional cash and liquid investments that have been advanced to Radian Group from our subsidiaries to pay for corporate expenses and interest payments. Total liquidity, which includes our undrawn 275 million unsecured revolving credit facility, as described below, was 1.1 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Radian Group s available liquidity decreased by 149 million, due to the net impact of the redemption of the Senior Notes due 2025 and 2024 and the issuance of the Senior Notes due 2029 and the payments for dividends and share repurchases, as described, partially offset by the 485 million in ordinary dividends received from Radian Guaranty. 
 In addition to available cash and marketable securities, including net investment income earned on such investments, Radian Group s principal sources of cash to fund future liquidity needs include: (i) payments made to Radian Group by its subsidiaries under expense- and tax-sharing arrangements and (ii) to the extent available, dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries. 
 Radian Group has in place a 275 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of bank lenders. Subject to certain limitations, borrowings under the credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, capital contributions to our insurance and other subsidiaries as well as growth initiatives. At September 30, 2024, the full 275 million remains undrawn and available under the facility. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the unsecured revolving credit facility. 
 In connection with our Mortgage Conduit business, Radian Mortgage Capital has entered into the Master Repurchase Agreements. As of September 30, 2024, Radian Group has entered into three separate Parent Guarantees to guaranty the obligations under the Master Repurchase Agreements. See Note 12 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition to financing the acquisition of mortgage loan assets under the Master Repurchase Agreements, Radian Mortgage Capital may fund such purchases directly using capital contributed from Radian Group. 
 We expect Radian Group s principal liquidity demands for the next 12 months to be: (i) the payment of corporate expenses, including taxes; (ii) interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations; (iii) the payment of quarterly dividends on 
 66 

Part I. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 our common stock, which are currently 0.245 per share, and which remain subject to approval by our board of directors and our ongoing assessment of our financial condition and potential needs related to the execution and implementation of our business plans and strategies; (iv) the potential continued repurchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to share repurchase authorizations, as described below; and (v) investments to support our business strategy, including capital contributions to our subsidiaries. 
 In addition to our ongoing short-term liquidity needs discussed above, our most significant need for liquidity beyond the next 12 months is the repayment of 1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior debt due in future years. See Capitalization Holding Company below for details of our debt maturity profile. 
 Radian Group s liquidity demands for the next 12 months or in future periods could also include: (i) early repurchases or redemptions of portions of our debt obligations and (ii) potential payments pursuant to the Parent Guarantees. 
 For additional information about related risks and uncertainties, see Our sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund our obligations and Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 In addition to Radian Group s existing sources of liquidity to fund its obligations, we may decide to seek additional capital, including by incurring additional debt, issuing additional equity, or selling assets, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all. 
 Share Repurchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 4.8 million shares of Radian Group common stock under a program authorized by Radian Group s board of directors, at a total cost of 149 million, including commissions. See Note 14 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our share repurchase programs. 
 Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. In February 2024, Radian Group s board of directors authorized an increase to the Company s quarterly dividend from 0.225 to 0.245 per share. Based on our outstanding shares of common stock and our current dividend level, which our board of directors may change as discussed above, we would require approximately 147 million in the aggregate to pay dividends for the next 12 months, plus an incremental amount for dividend equivalents that will fluctuate based on final shares vested under our performance-based RSU programs. So long as no default or event of default exists under our revolving credit facility or the Parent Guarantees, Radian Group is not subject to any legal or contractual limitations on its ability to pay dividends except those generally applicable to corporations that are incorporated in Delaware. See Note 12 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends remains subject to the board of directors discretion and determination. 
 Corporate Expenses and Interest Expense. Radian Group has expense-sharing arrangements in place with its principal operating subsidiaries that require those subsidiaries to pay their allocated share of certain holding-company-level expenses, including interest payments on Radian Group s outstanding debt obligations. Corporate expenses and interest expense on Radian Group s debt obligations allocated under these arrangements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of 131 million and 65 million, respectively, were substantially all reimbursed by its subsidiaries. We expect substantially all of our holding company expenses to continue to be reimbursed by our subsidiaries under our expense-sharing arrangements. The expense-sharing arrangements between Radian Group and its mortgage insurance subsidiaries, as amended, have been approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, but such approval may be modified or revoked at any time. 
 Taxes. Pursuant to our tax-sharing agreements, our operating subsidiaries pay Radian Group an amount equal to any federal income tax the subsidiary would have paid on a standalone basis if they were not part of our consolidated tax return. As a result, from time to time, under the provisions of our tax-sharing agreements, Radian Group may pay to or receive from its operating subsidiaries amounts that differ from Radian Group s consolidated federal tax payment obligation. Radian Group received 15 million of tax-sharing agreement payments from its subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

(1) Calculated as carrying value of senior notes, which were issued and are owed by our holding company, divided by carrying value of senior notes and stockholders equity. This holding company ratio does not include the effects of amounts owed by our subsidiaries related to secured borrowings. 

Stockholders equity increased by 301 million from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024. The net increase in stockholders equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted primarily from our net income of: (i) 456 million, and (ii) a net decrease in unrealized losses on investment securities of 98 million as a result of decreases in market interest rates during the period. These items were partially offset by: (i) share repurchases of 149 million, excluding related excise taxes due and (ii) dividend and dividend equivalents of 115 million. As of September 30, 2024, we did not expect to realize a loss for our investments in an unrealized loss position given our intent and ability to hold these investment securities until recovery of their amortized cost basis. 
 The increase in book value per share from 28.71 at December 31, 2023, to 31.37 at September 30, 2024, is primarily due to: (i) an increase of 2.98 per share attributable to our net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and (ii) an increase of 0.64 per share due to a net decrease in unrealized losses in our available for sale securities, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. These increases were partially offset primarily by a decrease of 0.75 per share attributable to dividends and dividend equivalents. 
 We regularly evaluate opportunities, based on market conditions, to finance our operations by accessing the capital markets or entering into other types of financing arrangements with institutional and other lenders. We also regularly consider various measures to improve our capital and liquidity positions, as well as to strengthen our balance sheet, improve Radian Group s debt maturity profile and maintain adequate liquidity for our operations. Among other things, these measures may include borrowing agreements or arrangements, such as securities or other master repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities. 
 In the past we have repurchased or exchanged, prior to maturity, some of our outstanding debt, and in the future, we may from time to time seek to redeem, repurchase or exchange for other securities, or otherwise restructure or refinance some or all of our outstanding debt prior to maturity in the open market through other public or private transactions, including pursuant to one or more tender offers or through any combination of the foregoing, as circumstances may allow. The timing or amount of any potential transactions will depend on a number of factors, including market opportunities and our views regarding our capital and liquidity positions and potential future needs. There can be no assurance that any such transactions will be completed on favorable terms, or at all.

Part I. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Mortgage Insurance 
 Historically, one of the primary demands for liquidity in our Mortgage Insurance business is the payment of claims, net of reinsurance, including from commutations and settlements. See Note 11 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our mortgage insurance reserve for losses and LAE, which represents our best estimate for the costs of settling future claims on currently defaulted mortgage loans. 
 Other principal demands for liquidity in our Mortgage Insurance business are expected to include: (i) expenses (including those allocated from Radian Group); (ii) repayments of FHLB advances; (iii) distributions from Radian Guaranty to Radian Group, including returns of capital or recurring ordinary dividends, as discussed below; and (iv) taxes, including potential additional purchases of U.S. Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds. See Notes 10 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information related to these non-interest-bearing instruments. 
 The principal sources of liquidity in our Mortgage Insurance business currently include insurance premiums, net investment income and cash flows from: (i) investment sales and maturities; (ii) FHLB advances; and (iii) if necessary, capital contributions from Radian Group. We believe that the operating cash flows generated by each of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries will provide these subsidiaries with the funds necessary to satisfy their needs for the foreseeable future. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Radian Guaranty maintained claims paying resources of 6 billion on a statutory basis, which consist of contingency reserves, statutory policyholders surplus, premiums received but not yet earned and loss reserves. In addition, our reinsurance programs are designed to provide additional claims-paying resources during times of economic stress and elevated losses. See Note 8 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Radian Guaranty s Risk-to-capital as of September 30, 2024, was 10.3 to 1. Radian Guaranty is not expected to need additional capital to satisfy state insurance regulatory requirements. At September 30, 2024, Radian Guaranty had statutory policyholders surplus of 691 million. This balance includes an 870 million benefit from U.S. Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which mortgage guaranty insurers such as Radian Guaranty may purchase in order to be eligible for a tax deduction, subject to certain limitations, related to amounts required to be set aside in statutory contingency reserves. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty s eligibility could reduce our available liquidit y under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information. 
 Radian Guaranty currently is an approved mortgage insurer under the PMIERs. Private mortgage insurers, including Radian Guaranty, are required to comply with the PMIERs to remain approved insurers of loans purchased by the GSEs. At September 30, 2024, Radian Guaranty s Available Assets under the PMIERs financial requirements totaled 6.0 billion, resulting in a PMIERs Cushion of 2.1 billion, or 55 , over its Minimum Required Assets. Those amounts compare to Available Assets of 5.9 billion and a PMIERs cushion of 2.3 billion, or 62 , at December 31, 2023. See Overview Legislative and Regulatory Developments for more information on the PMIERs. 
 Despite holding assets above the minimum statutory capital thresholds and PMIERs financial requirements, the ability of Radian s mortgage insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends on their common stock is restricted by certain provisions of the insurance laws of Pennsylvania, their state of domicile. Under Pennsylvania s insurance laws, ordinary dividends and other distributions may only be paid out of an insurer s positive unassigned surplus unless the Pennsylvania Insurance Department approves the payment of dividends or other distributions from another source. Radian Guaranty paid ordinary dividends to Radian Group of 485 million during the first nine months of 2024 and expects to maintain the ability to pay additional ordinary dividends during the remainder of 2024. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on our statutory dividend restrictions and contingency reserve requirements. 
 Radian Guaranty is a member of the FHLB. As a member, it may borrow from the FHLB, subject to certain conditions, which include requirements to post collateral and to maintain a minimum investment in FHLB stock. Advances from the FHLB may be used to provide low-cost, supplemental liquidity for various purposes, including to fund incremental investments. Radian s current strategy includes using FHLB advances as financing for general cash management and liquidity purposes. As of September 30, 2024, there were 54 million of FHLB advances outstanding. See Note 12 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 All Other 
 Additional capital support may also be required for potential investments in our other business initiatives to support our strategy of growing our businesses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Radian Group made 60 million of additional equity contributions to support our Title, Real Estate Services and Real Estate Technology businesses. During that same period, Radian Group also made 70 million of additional equity contributions to facilitate the growth of our Mortgage Conduit business. 
 In the event the cash flows from operations of our All Other businesses continue to be insufficient to fund all of their needs, Radian Group may continue to provide additional funds in the form of additional capital contributions or other support. See Investments to grow our existing businesses, pursue new lines of business or new products and services within existing lines of business subject us to additional risks and uncertainties under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Ratings 
 Ratings independently assigned by third-party statistical rating organizations often are considered in assessing our credit strength and the financial strength of our primary insurance subsidiaries. Radian Group, Radian Guaranty and Radian Title Insurance are currently assigned the financial strength ratings set forth in the chart below, which are provided for informational purposes only and are subject to change. See The current financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries could weaken our competitive position and potential downgrades by rating agencies to these ratings and the ratings assigned to Radian Group could adversely affect the Company under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Critical Accoun ting Estimates 
 As of the filing date of this report, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates from those discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K. See Note 2 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted that may impact the Company s consolidated financial position, earnings, cash flows or disclosures. 
 Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in market conditions. Examples of market risk include changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. We regularly analyze our exposure to interest rate risk and credit spread risk and have determined that the fair value of our investments is materially exposed to changes in both interest rates and credit spreads. See Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. Residential mortgage loans held for sale increased from 33 million at December 31, 2023, to 530 million at September 30, 2024. See Note 7 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our residential mortgage loans held for sale and related hedging activities. Other than the higher balances of residential mortgage loans held for sale and related derivatives, our market risk exposures at September 30, 2024, which primarily relate to interest rate and credit risk, have not materially changed from those identified in our 2023 Form 10-K.
