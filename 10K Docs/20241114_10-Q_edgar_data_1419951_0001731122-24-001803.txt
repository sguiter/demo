The valuation methodology used to determine the fair
value of the options issued during the year was the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of a
number of assumptions including the volatility of the stock price, the average risk-free interest rate, and the weighted average expected
life of the options. 

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon
observed interest rates on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds whose maturity period is appropriate for the term of the options. 

Estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by
which the Company s stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of the award. The Company s calculation
of estimated volatility is based on historical stock prices of the Company over a period equal to the expected life of the awards.

Company Overview 

Data Storage Corporation Data Storage, 
 we, us, our and the Company is headquartered in Melville, New York. Our common
stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq under the ticker symbol DTST. We operate through two subsidiaries; CloudFirst
Technologies Corporation CloudFirst Technologies ), a Delaware corporation, and Nexxis Inc. These subsidiaries provide solutions
and services to a broad range of clients in several industries including healthcare, banking and finance, distribution services, manufacturing,
construction, education, and government. The subsidiaries maintain business development teams, as well as independent distribution channels. 

Strategic Growth and Infrastructure: In response
to a capital raise and Nasdaq uplisting in 2021, we expanded our distribution networks and bolstered our team, focusing on enhancing our
sales, marketing, and technological capabilities. Data Storage operates seven geographically diverse data centers across the U.S. and
Canada, supporting its commitment to providing secure and reliable subscription-based services. 

Core Services: 

Business
 Continuity Solutions: Offers rapid recovery from system outages and disasters, ensuring minimal operational disruption. 

Managed
 Cloud Infrastructure Services: Facilitates cloud migration and provides ongoing support for software applications and technical
 workloads in a multi-cloud environment. 

Cyber
 Security: Delivers comprehensive security consultation, data protection, disaster recovery, and remote monitoring services, either
 integrated into cloud solutions or as standalone offerings. 

25 

Client Engagement and Revenue Generation: We
engage with clients through direct business development efforts and a broad distribution network, offering solutions that lower barriers
to entry for disaster recovery and cloud infrastructure services. While subscription-based services constitute a significant portion of
our revenue, we also generate income from the sale of equipment and software, emphasizing cybersecurity, data storage, and IBM Power systems
solutions. 

This overview highlights Data Storage Corporation s
strategic approach to leveraging technology and expertise to meet the complex needs of its diverse client base, ensuring business continuity
and security in an increasingly digital world. 

2024 Business Update Summary 

In the first half of 2024, we
laid a strong foundation for sustained growth. Strategic capital allocation toward professional services, business development, and account
management has been pivotal. The January 1st merger of CloudFirst Technologies and Flagship Solutions LLC into a single subsidiary of
Data Storage Corporation has positioned us to advance key strategic initiatives effectively. 

 Our expansion into Europe, with
a primary focus on the United Kingdom (UK), is underway. Equipment procurement for our three data center locations has commenced, and
we project the platform will be operational and ready for client onboarding by January 2025. Management estimates that the UK and European
Union (EU) markets includes more than 50,000 businesses with established trade and operations spanning the USA, UK, and EU, a prospect
that bolsters our marketing strategy. The close economic and commercial ties between these countries are expected to enhance our efforts
to penetrate the UK and EU markets. CloudFirst Technologies wholly owned subsidiary, UK Cloud Host Technologies Ltd., has established
an executive presence in London and appointed Colin Freeman as Managing Director to lead the European expansion. Banking facilities are
established, and we are actively progressing in our execution phase. 

 Our initial expansion outside
the USA began with establishing a presence in Canada, where CloudFirst Technologies operates two IBM Power platforms. The trading relationship
between the UK, Canada, and the USA presents substantial growth potential. We believe these interconnected markets offer a significant
addressable opportunity. Our portfolio of cloud infrastructure services, including cloud hosting, disaster recovery, and cybersecurity,
positions Data Storage as a comprehensive, multi-country service provider one of the few offering such breadth and capability. 

 Our CXO (Client
Experience Officer) program, announced earlier this year, is driving tangible outcomes by deepening client engagement, enhancing cross-selling
opportunities, and exceeding service expectations. 

 We maintain our focus and operational
stability. While market conditions remain unpredictable, our cash position is solid, and we forecast continued positive EBITDA from our
subsidiary operations. 

26 

Operational Footprint: 

Data Storage Corporation operates from offices in
New York and Texas, equipped with data centers designed to meet client requirements effectively. We also employ remote staff to complement
our office teams and manages a robust infrastructure across seven geographically diverse data centers in the United States and Canada,
supporting our comprehensive subscription-based solutions. 

Recent Developments 

On May 3, 2024, the Board signed a resolution to amend
our Bylaws to provide that at each meeting of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by law, the presence in person or by proxy
of the holders of thirty-three and one-third percent of the outstanding shares of our voting stock shall constitute a quorum. 

 On June 20, 2024, we held
our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the 2024 Annual Meeting ). At the 2024 Annual Meeting, our stockholders approved
an amendment to our 2021 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares
of common stock that we will have authority to grant under the Incentive Plan by an additional 1,000,000 shares of common stock to 2,075,000. 

On July 18, 2024, we entered into an Equity Distribution
Agreement (the Agreement ), with Maxim Group LLC Maxim ), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time
to time, through Maxim, as sales agent or principal, shares of our common stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement,
Maxim will use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, applicable state and federal law,
rules and regulations and the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market to sell shares from time to time based upon our instructions, including
any price, time or size limits specified by us. Under the Agreement, Maxim may sell shares by any method deemed to be an at the
market offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any other method permitted by law, including
in privately negotiated transactions. Maxim s obligations to sell shares under the Agreement are subject to satisfaction of certain
conditions, including customary closing conditions for transactions of this nature. We will pay Maxim a commission of 2.5 of the aggregate
gross proceeds from each sale of shares and have agreed to provide Maxim with customary indemnification and contribution rights. We also
agreed to reimburse Maxim for certain specified expenses of up to 50,000. Sales of shares of common stock under the Agreement will be
made pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-280881) (the Registration Statement and a related
prospectus supplement (the ATM Prospectus ), both of which were filed with the SEC on July 18, 2024. The ATM Prospectus relates
to the offering of up to 10,600,000 shares of our common stock. The issuance and sale, if any, of common stock under the Agreement is
subject to us maintaining an effective registration statement. The Registration Statement was declared effective on July 26, 2024. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to September 30, 2023 

Total Sales. For the three months ended September
30, 2024, total sales were 5,808,834, a decrease of 177,791 or 3 , compared to 5,986,625 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
The decrease is primarily attributed to lower one-time Equipment and Software sales during the current period and a decrease in Managed
Services, primarily offset by an increase in Infrastructure Disaster Recovery/Cloud Services.. Typically, we generate a higher margin
on Infrastructure Disaster Recovery/Cloud Services than we do on one-time Equipment Sales.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The consolidated financial
statements have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP applicable
for a going concern, which assumes that we will realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the ordinary course of business. 

To the extent we are successful
in growing our business, identifying potential acquisition targets, and negotiating the terms of such acquisition, and in the event the
purchase price includes a cash component, we plan to use our working capital and the proceeds of any financing to finance such acquisition
and related costs. 

Our opinion concerning our
liquidity is based on current information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, or if circumstances change, we may not be able
to meet our liquidity needs, which will likely require a renegotiation of related party capital equipment leases, a reduction in advertising
and marketing programs, and/or a reduction in salaries for officers that are major shareholders. 

We have long-term contracts to supply our subscription-based
solutions that are invoiced to clients monthly. We continue to see an uptick in client interest distribution channel expansion and in
sales proposals. In 2024, we have and intend to continue to work to increase our presence in the IBM Power I infrastructure
cloud and business continuity marketplace in the niche of IBM Power and in the disaster recovery global marketplace utilizing
its technical expertise, data centers utilization, assets deployed in the data centers, 24 x 365 monitoring and software. 

On July 18, 2024, we entered into the Agreement with
Maxim pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through Maxim, as sales agent or principal, shares of our common stock.
There can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise capital from sales under the Agreement. To date, we have not made any sales under
the Agreement,

Operating activities 

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash
provided by operating activities was 552,590, compared to 2,161,424 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of
 1,608,834 is primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable of 1,897,218, partially offset by the 317,388 increase in adjustments
for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation.

Investing activities 

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net
cash used in investing activities totaled 1,172,581, compared to 2,767,949 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
of 1,595,368 was primarily due to a net decrease in the purchases of marketable securities. 

Financing activities 

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net
cash used in financing activities totaled 295,021, compared to 686,809 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
of 391,788 was primarily due to lower repayments of finance lease obligations to a related party. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2023 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our
cash decreased by 915,012 to 513,718 from 1,428,730 on December 31, 2023. Net cash of 552,590 was provided by our operating activities
resulting primarily from the changes in assets and liabilities. Net cash of 1,172,581 was used in investing activities principally related
to the purchase of equipment. Net cash of 295,021 was used in financing activities primarily related to repayments of finance lease obligations,
partially offset by proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. 

 The Company s working capital was 11,583,279
on September 30, 2024, increasing by 571,872 from 11,011,407 at December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase
in accounts receivable and other current assets and a decrease in deferred revenue and finance leases. This was offset by a decrease in
cash and an increase in accounts payable. 

Critical Accounting
Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe that
the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties in making
estimates, actual results may differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. There are
accounting policies, each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, that we believe are significant
to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements . The critical accounting estimates that affect the consolidated financial
statements and the judgments and assumptions used are consistent with those described under Part II, Item 7 of the 2023 Annual Report. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements,
financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as special purpose entities . 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

Adjusted EBITDA 

To supplement our consolidated financial statements
presented in accordance with GAAP and to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we consider and
are including herein Adjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP financial measure. We view Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure and, as
such, we believe that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to it is net income (loss). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net
income adjusted for interest and financing fees, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and other non-cash income and expenses.
We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides us an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors, debtholders
and others to evaluate and compare ongoing operating results from period to period by removing the impact of our asset base, any asset
disposals or impairments, stock-based compensation and other non-cash income and expense items associated with our reliance on issuing
equity-linked debt securities to fund our working capital. 

31 

Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical
tool, and this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP,
as the excluded items may have significant effects on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, our measure of Adjusted
EBITDA may differ from other companies measure of Adjusted EBITDA. When evaluating our performance, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered
with other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income and other GAAP results. In the future, we may
disclose different non-GAAP financial measures in order to help our investors and others more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future
results of operations to our previously reported results of operations. 

The following table shows our reconciliation of net
income to adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively:

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

As a smaller reporting company this item is not required. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . 

As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including its principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule
13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Rule
13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act defines disclosure controls and procedures as controls and other procedures of a company
that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance
level at September 30, 2024. 

A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Due to its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined
to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Accordingly, our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control
system are met. As set forth above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on the evaluation as
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to
provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system were met. 

33 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

From time to time, the Company may become involved
in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. The Company is not presently a party to any
legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to it, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on its business,
operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company
because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Investing in our securities
involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and the risk factors set forth in our 2023 Annual Report,
together with all the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed financial statements and notes
thereto. If any of the following risks actually materialize, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially
adversely affected. The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the information disclosed in Part I, Item
1A, Risk Factors, contained in our 2023 Annual Report. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from
the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. 

The Company has not
generated a significant amount of net income and it may not be able to sustain profitability in the future. 

As reflected in the consolidated
financial statements, the Company had net income attributable to common shareholders of 235,259 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024, and 381,575 for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of 513,718, marketable securities
of 11,374,769, and working capital of 11,583,279. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to generate income in the
future. 

We cannot be assured
that we will be able to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

Our securities are listed
on The Nasdaq Capital Market, a national securities exchange. We cannot be assured that we will continue to comply with the rules, regulations
or requirements governing the listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market or that our securities will continue to be listed
on Nasdaq Capital Market in the future. If Nasdaq should determine at any time that we fail to meet Nasdaq requirements, we may be subject
to a delisting action by Nasdaq. 

On January 18, 2024, Nasdaq
notified the Company that due to the passing of Mr. Hoffman, a member of our Board of Directors and member of our Audit Committee, the
Company was no longer compliant with Nasdaq s audit committee requirements as set forth in Rule 5605(c)(2)(A) of the Nasdaq listing
standards. Nasdaq further notified the Company that, consistent with Rule 5605(c)(4) of the Nasdaq listing standards, Nasdaq provided
the Company a cure period in order to regain compliance until the earlier of the Company s next annual meeting of shareholders or
December 30, 2024 or, if the next annual meeting of shareholders is held before June 27, 2024, then the Company must provide evidence
of compliance no later than June 27, 2024. 

On April 2, 2024, the Company
received a letter (the Notification Letter from Nasdaq stating that, based on the information regarding the appointment
of Nancy M. Stallone, CPA to the Company s Board of Directors and Audit Committee, Nasdaq has determined that the Company complies
with the Audit Committee requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Listing Rules 5605(c)(2), which requires
that the Company maintain an audit committee of at least three members, each of whom must meet specified criteria, including certain independence
criteria. Accordingly, the Nasdaq staff has determined that the Company has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2) and
has indicated that the matter is now closed. 

34 

If Nasdaq delists our securities
from trading on its exchange at some future date, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

a limited availability
 of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity with
 respect to our securities; 

a determination that our
 common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules,
 possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock; 

a limited amount of news
 and analyst coverage for our company; and 

a decreased ability to
 issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

Upon exercise of the
Company s outstanding options or warrants, it will be obligated to issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock
which will dilute its present shareholders. 

The Company is obligated
to issue additional shares of its common stock in connection with any exercise or conversion, as applicable, of its outstanding options,
warrants, and shares of its convertible preferred stock. As of September 30, 2024, there were options and warrants outstanding convertible
into an aggregate of 3,145,014 shares of common stock. The exercise of warrants or options will cause the Company to issue additional
shares of its common stock and will dilute the percentage ownership of its shareholders. In addition, the Company has in the past, and
may in the future, exchange outstanding securities for other securities on terms that are dilutive to the securities held by other shareholders
not participating in such an exchange. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds. 

(a) Unregistered Sales
of Equity Securities 

There were no unregistered
sales of the Company s equity securities during the period ended September 30, 2024, that were not previously reported in a
Current Report on Form 8-K. 

(b) Use of Proceeds 

Not applicable. 

(c) Issuer Purchase of
Equity Securities 

None. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 

There were no defaults upon senior securities during
the period ended September 30, 2024. 

35 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not Applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non Rule 10b5-1
trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, except as set forth below. 

On September 12, 2024, each of Charles Piluso, Chris
Panagiotakos, Harold Schwartz and Thomas Kempster, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President and Executive Vice
President, respectively, of the Company, entered into written stock selling plans (the 10b5-1 Plans in accordance with
Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and the Company s Insider Trading Policy. We have been advised that it is the intent of Messrs.
Piluso, Panagiotakos, Schwartz and Kempster to use the proceeds of any sales of common stock made pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plans to pay
income tax obligations related to awards of restricted stock units made pursuant to our 2021 Stock Incentive Plan. 

The 10b5-1 Plans entered into by Messrs. Piluso, Panagiotakos,
Schwartz and Kempster allow for the sale of a maximum of approximately 8,967, 6,072, 5,299 and 5,299 shares, respectively, of our common
stock, over a seven-month period beginning on September 12, 2024 through April 15, 2025. Sales of shares by Messrs. Piluso, Panagiotakos,
Schwartz and Kempster pursuant to the 10b5-1 Plans provide for sales of specified share amounts on the open market on specified dates
at prevailing market prices.

CERTIFICATION OF PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER 

PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE 

SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 

I, Charles M. Piluso, certify
that: 

1. 
 I
 have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Data Storage Corporation; 

2. 
 Based
 on my knowledge, this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
 necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
 to the period covered by this report; 

3. 
 Based
 on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material
 respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in
 this report; 

4. 
 The
 registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
 (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
 Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 

a) 
 designed
 such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
 to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others
 within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 

b) 
 designed
 such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our
 supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
 for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 

c) 
 evaluated
 the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about
 the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation;

 in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s
 most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 

5. 
 The
 registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
 reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing
 the equivalent functions):
