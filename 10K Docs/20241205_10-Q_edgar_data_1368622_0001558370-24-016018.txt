 of remaining performance obligations under fully funded contracts with its customers, which the Company also refers to as funded backlog. The Company currently expects to recognize approximately of the remaining performance obligations as revenue in fiscal 2025 and the remaining in fiscal 2026 or beyond. The Company collects sales, value added, and other taxes concurrent with revenue producing activities, which are excluded from revenue when they are both imposed on a specific transaction and collected from a customer. Contract Estimates Accounting for contracts and programs primarily with a duration of less than six months involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs. For long-term contracts, the Company estimates the total expected costs to complete the contract and recognizes revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred at period end. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying the Company s performance obligations. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, materials, subcontractors costs, other direct costs, and indirect costs applicable on government and commercial contracts. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that may span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the performance of subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. The nature of the Company s contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including undefinitized contract actions which are within the scope of ASC 606 with final contract values to be negotiated, penalty fees and incentive awards generally for late delivery and early delivery, respectively. The Company generally estimates such variable consideration as the most likely amount. In addition, the Company includes the estimated variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the related uncertainty is resolved. These estimates are based on historical award experience, anticipated

The impact of adjustments in contract estimates on the Company s operating earnings can be reflected in either operating costs and expenses, or revenue. The aggregate impact of adjustments in contract estimates on revenue related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods was and for the three and six month periods ended October 26, 2024, respectively. During the three and six months ended October 26, 2024, the Company definitized certain LMS undefinitized contract actions.

In the Company s services contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals, which is generally monthly, or upon the achievement of contractual milestones. Generally, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets recorded in unbilled receivables and retentions on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. However, the Company sometimes receives advances or deposits from its customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in contract liabilities recorded in customer advances on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Contract liabilities are not a significant financing component as they are generally utilized to pay for contract costs within a one-year period or are used to ensure the customer meets contractual requirements. These assets and liabilities are reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. For the Company s product revenue, the Company generally receives cash payments subsequent to satisfying the performance obligation via delivery of the product, resulting in billed accounts receivable. Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the three and six month periods ended October 26, 2024 were not materially impacted by any other factors. For the Company s contracts, there are no significant gaps between the receipt of payment and the transfer of the associated goods and services to the customer for material amounts of consideration.

If the Company determines the option to extend or terminate is reasonably certain, it is included in the determination of lease assets and liabilities. For operating leases, the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of the Company s real estate lease agreements contain incentives for tenant improvements, rent holidays, or rent escalation clauses. For tenant improvement incentives, if the incentive is determined to be a leasehold improvement owned by the lessee, the Company generally records incentive as a reduction to fixed lease payments thereby reducing rent expense. For rent holidays and rent escalation clauses during the lease term, the Company records rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. For these lease incentives, the Company uses the date of initial possession as the commencement date, which is generally when the Company is given the right of access to the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for intended use. The Company does not have any material restrictions or covenants in its lease agreements, sale-leaseback transactions, land easements or residual value guarantees. In determining the inputs to the incremental borrowing rate calculation, the Company makes judgments about the value of the leased asset, its credit rating and the lease term including the probability of its exercising options to extend or terminate the underlying lease. Additionally, the Company makes judgments around contractual asset substitution rights in determining whether a contract contains a lease.

Use of different estimates and judgments could yield materially different results. The goodwill is attributable to the synergies the Company expects to achieve through leveraging the acquired technology to its existing customers, the workforce of Tomahawk and expected future customers in the UxS market. For income tax purposes the acquisition is treated as a stock acquisition, as such the goodwill associated with this purchase is not deductible.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipates, believes, could, estimates, expects, intends, may, plans, potential, predicts, projects, should, will, would or similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, our management s beliefs and assumptions made by our management. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, as updated by our subsequent filings under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Unless required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as result of new information, future events or otherwise. Critical Accounting Estimates The following should be read in conjunction with the critical accounting estimates presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. When we prepare these condensed consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Some of our accounting policies require that we make subjective judgments, including estimates that involve matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition, inventory reserves for excess and obsolescence, intangible assets acquired in a business combination, goodwill, and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). ASC 606 requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue for LMS product deliveries, customization of UGV transport vehicles and customer-funded research and development contracts is recognized over time as costs are incurred. Contract services revenue is for the provision of services, including repairs and maintenance, training, engineering design, development and prototyping activities, and technical support services. Contract services revenue, which historically included ISR services, is recognized over time as services are rendered. We elected the right to invoice practical expedient in which if an entity has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity s performance completed to date, such as flight hours for ISR services, the entity may recognize revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice. Training services are recognized over time using an output method based on days of training completed. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is generally recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with, and thereby best depict, transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 labor, materials, subcontractors costs, other direct costs, and indirect costs applicable on government and commercial contracts. For performance obligations which are not satisfied over time per the aforementioned criteria above, revenue is recognized at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. Our Uncrewed Systems product sales revenue is primarily composed of revenue recognized on contracts for the delivery of UxS systems and spare parts, respectively. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control transfers to the customer, which generally occurs when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. We review cost performance, estimates-to-complete and variable consideration at least quarterly and in many cases more frequently. Adjustments to original estimates for a contract s revenue, estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change, or if contract modifications, including the finalization of undefinitized contract actions, occur. The impact of revisions in estimate of completion and variable consideration for all types of contracts are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions are made. Changes in variable consideration associated with the finalization of undefinitized contract actions could result in cumulative catch up adjustments to revenue that could be material. During the three and six months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023, changes in accounting estimates on contracts recognized using the over time method are presented below. Amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in revenue if the order or claim meets the criteria of a contract or contract modification in accordance with ASC 606. Incentives or penalties and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. For the three months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023, favorable and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments included in revenue were as follows (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended October 26, October 28, 2024 2023 Gross favorable adjustments 8,909 4,138 Gross unfavorable adjustments (1,936) (1,321) Net favorable adjustments 6,973 2,817 For the three months ended October 26, 2024, favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of 8.9 million were primarily due to final cost adjustments on five contracts. During the three months ended October 26, 2024, we definitized certain LMS undefinitized contract actions. The aggregate impact of these cumulative catch-up revenue adjustments for the contract definitization was an increase to revenue of approximately 9.9 million. The remaining adjustments individually were not material. For the same period, unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of 1.9 million were primarily related to higher than expected costs on 26 contracts, which individually were not material. For the three months ended October 28, 2023, favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of 4.1 million were primarily due to final cost adjustments on seven contracts. During the three months ended October 28, 2023, we revised our estimates of the total expected costs to complete an LMS variant contract. The aggregate impact of these adjustments in contract estimates on revenue related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods was an increase to revenue of approximately 1.7 million. For the same period, unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of 1.3 million were primarily related to higher than expected costs on seven contracts, which individually were not material.

During the six months ended October 26, 2024, we definitized certain LMS undefinitized contract actions. The aggregate impact of these cumulative catch-up revenue adjustments for the contract definitization was an increase to revenue of approximately 9.9 million. The remaining adjustments individually were not material. For the same period, unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of 1.7 million were primarily related to higher than expected costs on 26 contracts, which individually were not material. For the six months ended October 28, 2023, favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of 5.6 million were primarily due to final cost adjustments on 10 contracts. During the six months ended October 28, 2023, we revised our estimates of the total expected costs to complete an LMS variant contract. The aggregate impact of these adjustments in contract estimates on revenue related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods was an increase to revenue of approximately 1.4 million. For the same period, unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of 2.0 million were primarily related to higher than expected costs on 10 contracts, which individually were not material. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when events or circumstances change in a manner that indicates goodwill might be impaired. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business or political climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends or significant underperformance relative to projected future results of operations. Our evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. For the impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, triggering events, cost factors, and overall financial performance, to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Alternatively, we may bypass the qualitative assessment for some or all of our reporting units and apply the quantitative impairment test. If determined to be necessary, the quantitative impairment test shall be used to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized (if any). For the quantitative impairment test we estimate the fair value by weighting the results from the income approach and the market approach. These valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, terminal value, discount rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability of our business. Subsequent to the performance of our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal year 2023, in May 2023 a trigger event was identified that indicated that the carrying value of the MUAS reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Specifically, we received notification that we were not down selected for a U.S. D.o.D. program of record which resulted in a significant decrease in the projected future cash flows of the MUAS reporting unit. As a result, we updated our estimates of long-term future cash flows to reflect lower revenue and profitability growth rate expectations used in the valuation of the MUAS reporting unit. These changes in estimates, resulted in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge of 156.0 million in the MUAS reporting unit during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023. 

 35 

Table of Contents 
 As of October 26, 2024, our MUAS reporting unit had a goodwill balance of 135.8 million. The estimated fair value of the MUAS reporting unit does not substantially exceed its carrying value due to the impairment recorded during the fourth quarter ended April 30, 2023. The fair value of the MUAS reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 10 as of January 28, 2024, the date of the most recent annual goodwill impairment test. Fair value determinations utilized in the quantitative goodwill impairment test require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax rates, discount rates, growth rates, and other market factors. Estimated future annual net cash flows based in part upon our ability to obtain contracts from the U.S. D.o.D. and foreign allied nations and negotiate the estimated pricing are considered the most significant, sensitive assumptions. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, income tax rates, or inflation, change, or if management s expectations or plans otherwise change, including updates to long-term operating plans, then MUAS may become impaired in the future. Accordingly, the MUAS reporting unit is considered at an increased risk of failing future quantitative goodwill impairment tests. The intangibles included in the MUAS reporting unit of 11.8 million as of October 26, 2024 will also be evaluated for potential impairment during the fourth quarter impairment test. During the most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, the estimated fair value of all reporting units, other than MUAS, substantially exceeded their carrying value. As of October 26, 2024, we have not identified any events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review prior to the Company s annual impairment test. The estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units are highly subjective in nature. Actual results can be materially different from the estimates and assumptions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or by us, or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets below the carrying amounts, we could recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which could be material. Fiscal Periods Due to our fixed year end date of April 30, our first and fourth quarters each consist of approximately 13 weeks. The second and third quarters each consist of exactly 13 weeks. Our first three quarters end on a Saturday. Our 2025 fiscal year ends on April 30, 2025 and our fiscal quarters end on July 27, 2024, October 26, 2024 and January 25, 2025, respectively.

Three Months Ended Six Months Ended October 26, October 28, October 26, October 28, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Cost of sales: Product sales 2,623 1,856 5,240 2,896 Contract services 1,097 1,356 2,193 2,712 Selling, general and administrative 1,075 1,201 2,150 1,970 Total 4,795 4,413 9,583 7,578 Revenue. Revenue for the three months ended October 26, 2024 was 188.5 million, as compared to 180.8 million for the three months ended October 28, 2023, representing an increase of 7.6 million, or 4 . The increase in revenue was due to an increase in product revenue of 5.4 million and an increase in service revenue of 2.2 million. The increase in product revenue was primarily due to an increase of 47.9 million from the production of our Switchblade products primarily driven by increased global demand for our Switchblade products associated with the current global conflicts as well as U.S. D.o.D. resupply and a cumulative catch-up revenue adjustment for the definitization of LMS contracts of 9.9 million. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in product deliveries of our UxS products of 41.8 million primarily due to a decrease in international sales. The increase in service revenue was primarily due to an increase of 5.1 million in customer funded R D and engineering services driven by an increase in HAPS return to flight services, partially offset by a decrease of 2.9 million of training and repairs service revenue driven by the decrease in UxS product sales. The increase in the LMS product revenues as compared to the prior year period is expected to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year ending April 30, 2025. Cost of Sales. Cost of sales for the three months ended October 26, 2024 was 114.8 million, as compared to 105.5 million for the three months ended October 28, 2023, representing an increase of 9.3 million, or 9 . The increase in cost of sales was a result of an increase in product cost of sales of 8.0 million and service costs of sales of 1.3 million. The increase in product costs of sales was primarily due to an increase of approximately 5 million associated with the increase in product revenue and approximately 3 million due to a mix shift to a higher proportion of lower margin products driven by the increase in Switchblade production. The increase in service cost of sales was primarily due to an increase of approximately 1 million associated with the increase in service revenue. Cost of sales for the three months ended October 26, 2024 included 3.7 million of intangible amortization and other related non-cash purchase accounting expenses as compared to 3.2 million for the three months ended October 28, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, cost of sales increased from 58 to 61 primarily due to an increase in the proportion of LMS product revenue, partially offset by the cumulative catch up adjustment for the definitization of LMS contracts, resulting in gross margin decreasing from 42 to 39 . Gross Margin. Gross margin is equal to revenue minus cost of sales. Selling, General and Administrative . SG A expense for the three months ended October 26, 2024 was 37.9 million, or 20 of revenue, as compared to SG A expense of 28.1 million, or 16 of revenue, for the three months ended October 28, 2023. The increase in SG A expense was primarily due to an increase of 4.3 million in employee related expenses primarily driven by an increase in average headcount to support our growth and expansion of our global business development team, an increase of 3.0 million of sales and marketing expense primarily driven by an increase in bid and proposal efforts, and an increase of 2.5 million in acquisition related expenses. Sales and marketing expense includes commissions on certain direct commercial sales to international customers, and an increase in revenue results in an increase in commission expense. Research and Development. R D expense for the three months ended October 26, 2024 was 28.7 million, or 15 of revenue, as compared to R D expense of 22.0 million, or 12 of revenue, for the three months ended October 28, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in development activities regarding enhanced capabilities for our products, development of new product lines and support for our acquired businesses.

Backlog Consistent with ASC 606, we define funded backlog as remaining performance obligations under firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract. As of October 26, 2024, our funded backlog was approximately 467.1 million, as compared to 400.2 million as of April 30, 2024. In addition to our funded backlog, we also had unfunded backlog of 1,829.1 million as of October 26, 2024. Unfunded backlog does not meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606. We define unfunded backlog as the total remaining potential order amounts under cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts with (i) multiple one-year options and IDIQ contracts, or (ii) incremental funding. Unfunded backlog does not obligate the customer to purchase goods or services. There can be no assurance that unfunded backlog will result in any orders in any particular period, if at all. Management believes that unfunded backlog does not provide a reliable measure of future estimated revenue under our contracts. A protest has been filed with the U.S. Government Accountability Office GAO challenging the U.S Department of the Army s decision on August 27, 2024 to award an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract with a ceiling value of 990.0 million on a sole source basis to AeroVironment, Inc. (the Company related to the Company s Switchblade systems, of which 860.0 million is included in unfunded backlog. Because of possible future changes in delivery schedules and/or cancellations of orders, backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales to be expected for any succeeding period, and actual sales for the year may not meet or exceed the backlog represented. Our backlog is typically subject to large variations from quarter to quarter as existing contracts expire or are renewed or new contracts are awarded. A majority of our contracts, specifically our IDIQ contracts, do not currently obligate the U.S. government to purchase any goods or services. Additionally, all U.S.

Liquidity and Capital Resources On September 8, 2022, we filed an S-3 shelf registration statement to offer and sell shares of our common stock, including a prospectus supplement in relation to an Open Market Sale Agreement SM , also dated September 8, 2022, with Jefferies LLC relating to the proposed offer and sale of shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 200.0 million from time to time through Jefferies LLC as our sales agent. During the three and six months ended October 28, 2023, we sold 807,370 shares for total gross proceeds of 91.3 million, total proceeds received of 88.6 million, net of commission expense and 88.4 million net of equity issuance costs. As of October 28, 2023, we completed the Open Market Sale Agreement SM and sold 1,917,100 of our shares for total gross proceeds of 200.0 million and 194.0 million proceeds received, net of commission expense and 193.1 million net of equity issuance costs. On February 19, 2021, in connection with the consummation of the Arcturus Acquisition, we entered into the Credit Agreement for (i) the Revolving Facility, and (ii) the Term Loan Facility, and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities. The Term Loan Facility required payment of 5 of the outstanding obligations in each of the first four loan years, consisting of three quarterly payments of 1.25 each, with the remaining outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan Facility due and payable on the final maturity date. Proceeds from the Term Loan Facility were used in part to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the Arcturus acquisition. On October 4, 2024, we amended the Credit Facility agreement to increase the Revolving Facility to 200 million, and the Term Loan Facility was fully repaid in full and removed from the Amended Credit Facility. Our ability to borrow under the Revolving Facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit of 9.8 million as of October 26, 2024. As of October 26, 2024, approximately 175.2 million was available under the Revolving Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions that meet certain parameters. Refer to Note 9 Debt to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details. In addition, Telerob has a line of credit of 7.0 million 7.6 million) available for issuing letters of credit of which 0.3 million 0.3 million) was outstanding as of October 26, 2024. We anticipate funding our normal recurring trade payables, accrued expenses, ongoing R D costs and obligations under the Credit Facilities through our existing working capital and funds provided by operating activities including those provided by our acquisitions. The majority of our purchase obligations are pursuant to funded contractual arrangements with our customers. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and other financing sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital, capital expenditure requirements, future obligations related to the acquisitions and obligations under the Credit Facilities during the next twelve months. There can be no assurance, however, that our business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, then we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures or draw on our Credit Facilities. We anticipate that existing sources of liquidity, Credit Facilities, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future. Our primary liquidity needs are for financing working capital, investing in capital expenditures, supporting product development efforts, introducing new products and enhancing existing products, marketing acceptance and adoption of our products and services, and possible acquisition of entities or strategic assets. Our future capital requirements, to a certain extent, are also subject to general conditions in or affecting the defense industry and are subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors that are beyond our control. Moreover, to the extent that existing cash, cash equivalents, cash from operations, and cash from our Credit Agreement are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing, subject to the limitations specified in our Credit Facility agreement. In addition, we may also need to seek additional equity funding or debt financing if we become a party to any agreement or letter of intent for potential investments in, or acquisitions of, businesses, services or technologies. In connection with the BlueHalo acquisition, we entered into the Debt Commitment Letter with BofA and JPM on November 18, 2024 to provide a new term loan, the Acquisition Financing Facility, . The initial principal amount of the 

 45 

Table of Contents 
 Acquisition Financing Facility will be 700,000,000, and the Acquisition Financing Facility will have a maturity date of two years from effective date of the Credit Agreement Amendment. The proceeds of the Acquisition Financing Facility will be used to refinance a portion of BlueHalo s debt and pay fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. The debt will be serviced from the combined cash flows of the Company and BlueHalo. Our working capital requirements vary by contract type. On cost-plus-fee programs, we typically bill our incurred costs and fees monthly as work progresses, and therefore working capital investment is minimal. On fixed-price contracts, we typically are paid as we deliver products, and working capital is needed to fund labor and expenses incurred during the lead time from contract award until contract deliveries begin. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, we made certain commitments outside of the ordinary course of business, including capital contribution commitments to a second limited partnership fund. Under the terms of a new limited partnership agreement, we have committed to make capital contributions to such fund totaling 20.0 million, inclusive of the expected reinvestment of distributions from our existing limited partnership fund, of which 10.0 million was remaining at October 26, 2024. The contributions are anticipated to be paid over the next three fiscal years. The UGV second year earnout of 2.0 million (approximately 2.1 million) was paid in November 2023. The Tomahawk acquisition closed on September 15, 2023, and we paid a total purchase price of 134.4 million consisting of 109.8 million in stock and 24.2 million from cash on hand, net of cash acquired. Due to the internal revenue service tax capitalization rules, Section 174, which requires R D expenditures to be capitalized and amortized over a 5 year period for tax purposes, we expect the elevated levels of cash paid for U.S. federal income taxes to continue during the fiscal year ending April 30, 2025 and future fiscal years. Cash Flows The following table provides our cash flow data for the six months ended October 26, 2024 and October 28, 2023 (in thousands): 

Six Months Ended October 26, October 28, 2024 2023 (Unaudited) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 24,709 (25,590) Net cash used in investing activities (11,630) (37,635) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (17,471) 31,544 Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended October 26, 2024 increased by 50.3 million to 24.7 million, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of (25.6) million for the six months ended October 28, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of 65.7 million, largely related to inventories and unbilled receivables and retentions, partially offset by accounts receivable and other liabilities, due to year over year timing differences as well as an increase in non-cash expenses of 4.4 million primarily due to a decrease in reserve for inventory excess and obsolescence, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization. Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 26.0 million to (11.6) million for the six months ended October 26, 2024, as compared to (37.6) million for the six months ended October 28, 2023. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in business acquisitions due to Tomahawk acquisition during the six months ended October 26, 2024. Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities increased by 49.0 million to (17.5) million for the six months ended October 26, 2024, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 31.5 million for the six months ended October 28, 2023. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from shares issued of 88.4 million, partially offset by net principal payments of the credit facilities of 42 million.

 New Accounting Standards Please refer to Note 1 Organization and Significant Accounting Policies to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the conclusion that we did not adopt any accounting standards during the six months ended October 26, 2024. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIV E DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to various market risk factors, including fluctuations in interest rates, changes in general economic conditions, domestic and foreign competition, and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk It is our policy not to enter into interest rate derivative financial instruments. On February 19, 2021, in connection with the consummation of the Arcturus Acquisition, we entered into the Credit Facilities. The current outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility is 15.0 million and bears a variable interest rate. The market interest rate has increased significantly, and if market interest rates continue to increase, interest due on the revolving credit facility would increase. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Since a significant part of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains or losses to date. We occasionally engage in forward contracts in foreign currencies to limit our exposure on non-U.S. dollar transactions. With the acquisition of Telerob, a portion of our cash balance is denominated in Euros which is Telerob s functional currency. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of October 26, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of October 26, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended October 26, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATIO N ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On August 9, 2021, a former employee filed a class action complaint against AeroVironment in California Superior Court in Los Angeles, California alleging various claims pursuant to the California Labor Code related to wages, meal breaks, overtime, unreimbursed business expenses and other recordkeeping matters. The complaint seeks a jury trial and payment of various alleged unpaid wages, penalties, interest and attorneys fees in unspecified amounts. We filed our answer on December 16, 2021. Written and oral discovery are ongoing. A mediation session in this matter is currently scheduled for May 8, 2025. On March 29, 2024, a former employee filed a complaint against AeroVironment in the Ventura County Superior Court in California, alleging violations of the California Labor Code related to wages, meal breaks, overtime, unreimbursed business expenses and other recordkeeping matters and seeking penalties recoverable under California Labor Code section 2698, et. seq., Private Attorney General Act of 2004 PAGA and all other remedies available under PAGA. The complaint seeks civil penalties on behalf of the plaintiff and similarly situations persons pursuant to PAGA. We filed our answer on June 20, 2024. The parties have stipulated to stay this PAGA case ahead of the mediation in the class action matter listed in the immediately preceding paragraph above. We are subject to lawsuits, government investigations, audits and other legal proceedings from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. It is not possible to predict the outcome of any legal proceeding with any certainty. The outcome or costs we incur in connection with a legal proceeding could adversely impact our operating results and financial position. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Except as set for below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. Please refer to that section for disclosures regarding the risks and uncertainties related to our business. Risks Relating to the Company s Pending Acquisition of BlueHalo The Transactions (as defined below) are subject to closing conditions and may not be completed, the Merger Agreement (as defined below) may be terminated in accordance with its terms, and we may be required to pay a termination fee upon termination. On November 18, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Archangel Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ), BlueHalo Financing Topco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company BlueHalo ), and BlueHalo Holdings Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and sole member of BlueHalo Financing Topco, LLC Seller ), pursuant to which, among other matters, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into BlueHalo, with BlueHalo continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the surviving company of the merger (the Transactions ). The Transactions are subject to customary closing conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the consummation of the Transactions (the Closing ), including, among other things, (i) the expiration or termination of the waiting period (or any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 HSR Act ), as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder, any agreement (including any timing agreement) with the Federal Trade Commission FTC or Department of Justice DOJ to delay the consummation of, or not to consummate before a certain date, the Transactions, and the receipt of other specified regulatory approvals and the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods, (ii) the required approval by the Company s stockholders, holders of incentive units and restricted common units of Seller (the Seller Members and Seller, as the sole member of BlueHalo (iii) the accuracy of the respective representations and warranties of each party, subject to certain materiality qualifications, (iv) compliance by the parties with their respective covenants, (v) the absence of any order that is in effect and restrains,

Table of Contents 
 enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Transactions, (vi) the shares of common stock to be issued in the Transactions being approved for listing (subject to official notice of issuance) on Nasdaq as of the Closing, (vii) the registration statement on Form S-4 (the Registration Statement to be filed in connection with the Transactions having become effective in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and not being subject to any stop order or proceeding (or threatened proceeding by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC )) seeking a stop order with respect to the Registration Statement that has not been withdrawn, (viii) delivery of certain closing certificates and executed ancillary agreements, (ix) the absence of any material adverse effect with respect to BlueHalo or the Company, (x) receipt of certain waivers or approvals related to Section 280G of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (xi) receipt by the Company of executed joinder and lock-up agreements from Seller Members entitled to receive 85 of the Aggregate Closing Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement), as adjusted, (xii) the absence of any Cognizant Security Agency (as defined in 32 C.F.R. 117.3(b)) objection that intends to invalidate, terminate, revoke or suspend any facility security clearances of BlueHalo and its subsidiaries if the Transactions occur, and (xiii) receipt of all required consents of governmental authorities pursuant to antitrust laws and foreign direct investments laws, as applicable. No assurance can be given that the required shareholder consents and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the consents and approvals. Any delay in completing the Transactions could cause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Transactions are successfully completed within the expected time frame. Additionally, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including, among other reasons, if the Transactions are not completed by August 18, 2025 (subject to certain conditions and one automatic extension period to February 18, 2026 as set forth in the Merger Agreement). The Company may be required to pay a termination fee of 200 million to Seller upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including (i) termination by the Company if the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board determines that an intervening event has occurred or the Board has received a proposal to acquire the Company that the Board has determined in good faith constitutes a superior offer pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (an Alternative Sale Transaction ), (ii) termination by Seller if the Board exercises its right, subject to certain limitations, to change its recommendation to the Company s stockholders with respect to the Merger Agreement and the Transactions (a Company Board Adverse Recommendation Change or (iii) if the Company consummates an Alternative Sale Transaction within nine months of termination of the Merger Agreement, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, if the Transactions are not completed for any reason, including as a result of failure to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals or if the Company stockholders fail to approve the applicable proposals, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the expected benefits of having completed the Transactions, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following: we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price we may experience negative reactions from our customers, suppliers, distributors, other business partners and employees we will be required to pay our costs relating to the Transactions, such as financial advisory, legal, financing and accounting costs and associated fees and expenses, whether or not the Transactions are completed the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Transactions will not be completed the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Transactions and such restrictions, the waiver of which are subject to the consent of BlueHalo or Seller, may prevent us from taking actions during the pendency of the Transactions that would be beneficial and 

 49 

Table of Contents 
 matters relating to the Transactions (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by management and other key employees, which could otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations or to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company. 
 The consideration payable under the Merger Agreement is fixed and will not be adjusted based on our performance. Under the Merger Agreement, the total aggregate merger consideration payable by us consists of 18,548,698 shares of our common stock, subject to downward adjustments as set forth in the Merger Agreement. The purchase price will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of our common stock or the economic performance of the Company or BlueHalo. If the market price of our common stock increases or the economic performance of BlueHalo relative to us declines (or the economic performance of BlueHalo relative to us improves), the consideration will not be adjusted to account for any such changes or any effective increase or decrease in the value of the consideration issued or paid to the equityholders of BlueHalo under the Merger Agreement. We will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions, including the risk of litigation, while the Transactions are pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, suppliers or customers. Uncertainty about the effect of the Transactions on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on us or BlueHalo, which uncertainties may impair our or BlueHalo s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Transactions are completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us or BlueHalo to seek to change existing business relationships with any of us. Employee retention and recruitment may be challenging before the completion of the Transactions, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the Transactions. Key employees may depart or prospective key employees may fail to accept employment with us or BlueHalo because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company following the Transactions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The pursuit of the Transactions and the preparation for the integration may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. The diversion of management s attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Until the completion of the Transactions or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, we are prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and our stockholders, and may find other transactions or actions impractical to undertake during such period. During the period between the date of the Merger Agreement and the Closing, which, under the Merger Agreement, could take until August 18, 2025 (subject to certain conditions and one automatic extension period to February 18, 2026 as set forth in the Merger Agreement), the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking specified actions or from pursuing what might otherwise be attractive business opportunities or making other changes to our business, in each case without the consent of BlueHalo or Seller. These restrictions may prevent us from taking actions during the pendency of the Transactions that would have been beneficial. Adverse effects arising from these restrictions during the pendency of the Transactions could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the Transactions or termination of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, even if the Merger Agreement does not expressly restrict us from taking a certain action prior to the completion of the Transactions or the termination of the Merger Agreement, the pendency of the Transactions may make it impractical for us to do so. For example, while we may wish to raise capital for strategic or other reasons and would not be prohibited from doing so under the Merger Agreement, our ability to do so may be limited, or may adversely affect the terms on which we are able to raise such capital.

Table of Contents 
 The Company and BlueHalo must obtain certain regulatory approvals and clearances to consummate the Transactions, which, if delayed, not granted or granted with unacceptable conditions, could prevent, substantially delay or impair consummation of the Transactions, result in additional expenditures of money and resources or reduce the anticipated benefits of the Transactions. Completion of the Transactions is conditioned upon the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the Transactions under the HSR Act and other similar antitrust laws in certain other countries as well as certain other applicable laws or regulations and the governmental authorizations required to complete the Transactions having been obtained and being in full force and effect. Although the Company and BlueHalo have agreed in the Merger Agreement to use their reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain governmental filings or obtain the required governmental authorizations, as the case may be, there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting periods will expire or authorizations will be obtained, and if such authorizations are not obtained, the Transactions will not be completed. At any time before or after consummation of the Transactions, the DOJ or the FTC, any state attorney general, or a governmental authority in another country could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including but not limited to seeking to enjoin the completion of the Transactions, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying or impeding consummation of the Transactions or of imposing additional costs or limitations on the Company or BlueHalo following completion of the Transactions, any of which might have an adverse effect on the Company or BlueHalo following completion of the Transactions and may diminish the anticipated benefits of the Transactions. The Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Transactions and may discourage a potential competing acquirer of the Company, including the payment by the Company of a termination fee. The Merger Agreement contains provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any action to facilitate any inquiries, announcements or communications relating to, or the making of any submission, proposal or offer that constitutes or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Parent Acquisition Proposal (as defined the Merger Agreement), (ii) enter into, participate in, cooperate with any person with respect to, maintain or continue any discussions or negotiations relating to, any Parent Acquisition Proposal with any person other than Seller, BlueHalo or their affiliates, (iii) furnish to any person other than Seller, BlueHalo or their affiliates any non-public information in connection with or in response to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (iv) accept any Parent Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement, term sheet, letter of intent, or understanding (whether written or oral) providing for the consummation of any transaction contemplated by any Parent Acquisition Proposal or otherwise relating to any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (v) adopt, approve or recommend or make any public statement approving or recommending any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (vi) take any action or exempt any person (other than the Company and its subsidiaries) from the restriction on business combinations or any similar provision contained in applicable takeover laws or the Company s organizational or other governing documents, or (vii) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its representatives and each of its subsidiaries (and each of their respective representatives) to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any persons conducted prior to or on the date of the Merger Agreement with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal. The Company may be required to pay a termination fee of 200 million to Seller upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including (i) termination by the Company to accept an Alternative Sale Transaction, (ii) termination by Seller due to the occurrence of a Company Board Adverse Recommendation Change or (iii) if the Company consummates an Alternative Sale Transaction within nine months of termination of the Merger Agreement, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement. These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of us from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay above market 

 51 

Table of Contents 
 value, or might otherwise result in a potential third-party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to our stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and we decide to seek another merger transaction, we may not be able to negotiate or consummate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger Agreement. The Transactions will involve substantial costs. We have incurred and expect to incur substantial non-recurring costs associated with the Transactions and combining the operations of the two companies, as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the Transactions. These costs and expenses include fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, regulatory and public relations advisors, filing fees, printing costs and other costs and expenses. Portions of these transaction costs are contingent upon the Closing occurring, although some have been and will be incurred regardless of whether the Transactions are consummated. In addition, the combined company will also incur significant restructuring and integration costs in connection with the integration of the Company and BlueHalo and the execution of our business plan, including costs relating to formulating and implementing integration plans and eliminating duplicative costs, as well as potential employment-related costs. The costs related to restructuring will be expensed as a cost of the ongoing results of operations of either us or the combined company. There are processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the Transactions and the integration of BlueHalo s business. While we have assumed a certain level of expenses would be incurred to integrate the Company and BlueHalo and achieve synergies and efficiencies and we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, many of these expenses are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately and there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or timing of these costs. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of strategic benefits, additional income, synergies and other efficiencies should allow the combined company to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. Securities class action and derivative lawsuits may be filed against us, or against our directors, challenging the Transactions, and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the Closing from occurring at all or from occurring within the expected time frame. Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into acquisition, merger or other business combination agreements. Transactions like the Transactions are frequently subject to litigation or other legal proceedings, including actions alleging that our Board breached their fiduciary duties to our stockholders by entering into the Merger Agreement. We cannot provide assurance that such litigation or other legal proceedings will not be brought. If litigation or other legal proceedings are in fact brought against us, or against our Board, we will defend against it, but we may not be successful in doing so. An adverse outcome in such matters, as well as the costs and efforts of a defense even if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial position of us or the combined company, including through the possible diversion of company resources or distraction of key personnel. Lawsuits that may be brought against us, BlueHalo or our or its directors could also seek, among other things, injunctive relief or other equitable relief, including a request to enjoin us from consummating the Transactions. One of the conditions to the Closing is that no order, award or judgment by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction has been entered and continues to be in effect and no law has been adopted or is effective, in either case, that prohibits or makes illegal the Closing. Consequently, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an order, award or judgment prohibiting completion of the Transactions, that order, award or judgment may delay or prevent the Closing from being completed within the expected time frame or at all, which may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.

 Combining the businesses of the Company and BlueHalo may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Transactions, which may adversely affect the combined company s business results and negatively affect the value of our common stock following the Closing. The Company and BlueHalo have operated and, until the completion of the Transactions will continue to operate, independently. The success of the Transactions will depend on, among other things, the ability of the Company and BlueHalo to combine their respective businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes expected cost savings. We have entered into the Merger Agreement because we believe that the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of our stockholders and that combining the businesses of the Company and BlueHalo will produce benefits as well as cost savings and other cost and capital expenditure synergies. Following the Closing, the Company and BlueHalo must successfully combine their respective businesses in a manner that permits these benefits to be realized. For example, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in integrating the operations of the two companies in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions: combining the companies operations and corporate functions combining the businesses of the Company and BlueHalo and meeting the capital requirements of the combined company in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve any cost savings or other synergies anticipated to result from the Transactions, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the Transactions not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all integrating personnel from the two companies harmonizing the companies operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes maintaining existing agreements with customers, suppliers, distributors and vendors, avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, suppliers, distributors and vendors, and leveraging relationships with such third parties for the benefit of the combined company addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies consolidating the companies administrative and information technology infrastructure coordinating distribution and marketing efforts and effecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory or other governmental approvals. 
 It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key AeroVironment or BlueHalo employees, the loss of customers, the disruption of either company s or both companies ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses. If the combined company is not able to adequately address integration challenges, we may be unable to successfully integrate operations and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. In addition, the combined company must achieve the anticipated growth and cost savings without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Transactions may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Additionally, we may inherit from BlueHalo legal, regulatory, and other risks that occurred prior to the Transactions, whether known or unknown to us, which may be material to the combined company.

 Actual growth, cost and capital expenditure synergies and other cost savings, if achieved, may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. Moreover, at times the attention of the combined company s management and resources may be focused on the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations or other opportunities that may have been beneficial to such company, which may disrupt the combined company s ongoing business. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Transactions, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the combined company, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock following the consummation of the Transactions. Moreover, if the combined company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Transactions, AeroVironment stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Transactions. The Transactions may be completed even though a material adverse effect may result from the announcement of the Transactions, industry-wide changes or other causes. In general, neither we nor BlueHalo is obligated to complete the Transactions if there is a material adverse effect impacting the other party between the date of the Merger Agreement and the Closing. However, certain types of changes are excluded from the concept of a material adverse effect as it is defined in the Merger Agreement. Such exclusions include but are not limited to changes in general economic or political conditions, industry wide changes, changes resulting from the announcement of the Transactions, natural disasters, pandemics, other public health events and changes in GAAP. Therefore, if any of these events were to occur affecting us or BlueHalo, the other party would still be obliged to effect the Closing. If any such adverse changes occur and we and BlueHalo execute the Closing, the stock price of the combined company may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the Transactions to the stockholders of the Company, BlueHalo or both. The combined company may not be able to retain customers, suppliers or distributors, or customers, suppliers or distributors may seek to modify contractual relationships with the combined company, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company s business and operations. Third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with the combined company. As a result of the Transactions, the combined company may experience impacts on relationships with customers, suppliers and distributors that may harm the combined company s business and results of operations. Certain customers, suppliers or distributors may seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations following the Closing whether or not contractual rights are triggered as a result. There can be no guarantee that customers, suppliers and distributors will remain with or continue to have a relationship with the combined company or do so on the same or similar contractual terms following the Closing. If any customers, suppliers or distributors seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations or discontinue the relationship with the combined company, then the combined company s business and results of operations may be harmed. If the combined company s suppliers were to seek to terminate or modify an arrangement with the combined company, then the combined company may be unable to procure necessary supplies from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. We and BlueHalo also have contracts with third parties, which may require consent from these parties in connection with the Transactions, or which may otherwise contain limitations applicable to such contracts following the Closing. If these consents cannot be obtained, the combined company may suffer a loss of potential future revenue, incur costs and lose rights that may be material to the combined company s business. In addition, third parties with whom we or BlueHalo currently have relationships may terminate or otherwise reduce the scope of their relationship in anticipation of the Closing. Any such disruptions could limit the combined company s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transactions. The adverse effect of any such disruptions could also be exacerbated by a delay in the Closing or by a termination of the Merger Agreement.

 Some of our and BlueHalo s directors and executive officers have interests in the Transactions that are different from yours and that may influence them to support or approve the Transactions without regard to your interests. Directors and executive officers of the Company and BlueHalo may have interests in the Transactions that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other AeroVironment stockholders generally. These interests with respect to our directors and executive officers may include, among others, acceleration of stock option or restricted stock unit vesting, retention bonus payments, severance payments if employment is terminated in a qualifying termination in connection with the Transactions and rights to continued indemnification, expense advancement and insurance coverage. The current members of our Board are expected to continue as directors of the combined company after the effective time of the Transactions, and, following the closing of the Transactions, will be eligible to be compensated similarly to other non-employee directors of the combined company. Our Board and the Board of Directors of BlueHalo were aware of and considered those interests, among other matters, in reaching their decisions to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, approve the Transactions, and recommend the approval of the Merger Agreement to the Company stockholders and BlueHalo holders, respectively. These interests, among other factors, may have influenced the directors and executive officers of the Company and BlueHalo to support or approve the Transactions. Following the Closing, funds affiliated with Arlington Capital Partners are expected to beneficially own approximately 26.2 of our common stock, which will allow them the ability to exert significant influence over us, and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. Following the Closing, funds affiliated with Arlington Capital Partners are expected to beneficially own approximately 26.2 of our common stock. Accordingly, after the Closing these stockholders may exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our directors and the determination of significant corporate actions. This concentration of voting power and control could have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing an action that might otherwise be beneficial to our other stockholders or that could be disadvantageous to our stockholders with interests different from yours. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, funds affiliated with Arlington Capital Partners (the Sponsor Members entered into a shareholder s agreement (the Shareholder s Agreement with the Company pursuant to which the Sponsor Members have, among other things, agreed to abide by customary standstill covenants, obligations to vote consistent with the recommendation of the Board, and customary employee non-solicit restrictions with respect to the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (including BlueHalo and its subsidiaries after the Closing). Under the Shareholder s Agreement, the Company has, among other things and subject to the Closing, agreed to provide the Sponsor Members with certain board designation rights and, following a lock-up period as set forth in the Shareholder s Agreement, customary registration rights, including customary demand and piggyback rights. The Sponsor Members will have such designation rights to designate two directors until it and its affiliates cease to collectively hold and own, directly or indirectly, at least 20 of the issued and outstanding Company common stock and the Sponsor Members will have such designation rights to designate one director until they and their affiliates cease to collectively hold and own, directly or indirectly, at least 15 but less than 20 of the issued and outstanding Company common stock. The Board of Directors of the combined company (the New Company Board is expected to consist of ten members, up to two of whom may be designated by the Sponsor Members for approval by the stockholders of the Company for appointment to the New Company Board, subject to certain conditions and qualifications as set forth in the Shareholder s Agreement (the Shareholder Nominees ). Moreover, the Shareholder s Agreement provides that we renounce any interests or expectancy in being offered any business opportunities which the Shareholder Nominees, the Sponsor Members, or their affiliates conduct whether directly or indirectly, whether or not such business is competitive with or in the same or similar lines of business as the Company. This renunciation does not extend to business opportunities invested in on the basis of confidential information received from the Company or its representatives.

 Our stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Transactions commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Transactions. If the combined company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Transactions, our stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Transactions. BlueHalo is currently not a U.S. public reporting company and the obligations associated with integrating into a public company may require significant resources and management attention. BlueHalo is, and prior to the Closing will remain, a private company that is not subject to public company reporting requirements and does not have accounting personnel specifically employed to review internal controls over financial reporting. Additionally, from the time it was formed until the time it entered the Merger Agreement, BlueHalo consummated a number of acquisitions of companies of varying degrees of size and sophistication with varying degrees of disclosure controls and procedures. As a public company, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the annual report. BlueHalo (including all of its prior acquisitions) will be required to be included in the scope of our internal control over financial reporting in the annual report to be filed with the SEC for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs and thereafter, which requires us to make and document significant changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. Bringing BlueHalo into compliance with these rules and regulations and integrating BlueHalo into our current compliance and accounting system and disclosure controls and procedures may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. Furthermore, the need to establish the necessary corporate infrastructure to integrate BlueHalo may divert management s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise upon the consummation of the Transactions and maintain our culture, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur to bring BlueHalo into compliance with these requirements. We anticipate that these costs will materially increase our selling, general and administration expenses. In addition, bringing BlueHalo into compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These additional obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Our stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in, and will exercise less influence over the management of, the combined company following the Closing as compared to their current ownership and voting interests in the respective companies. After the Closing, the current stockholders of AeroVironment will own a smaller percentage of the combined company than their ownership of AeroVironment prior to the Transactions. Immediately after the Closing, our securityholders as of immediately prior to the Closing are expected to own approximately 60.5 of the outstanding shares of the combined company on a fully-diluted basis and former BlueHalo securityholders, are expected to own approximately 39.5 of the outstanding shares of the combined company on a fully-diluted basis, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Merger Agreement. As a result of this reduced ownership, the current stockholders of AeroVironment will be able to exercise less influence over the combined company following the Closing as compared to their current ownership. We anticipate our indebtedness will increase upon completion of the Transactions and may have the effect of heightening other risks we now face. Upon completion of the Transactions, we intend to refinance certain indebtedness of BlueHalo and, assuming that occurs, our consolidated indebtedness will increase substantially and we will be subject to increased risks associated with

 debt financing. As of October 26, 2024, we had indebtedness of approximately 15 million under our existing credit agreement. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter (the Debt Commitment Letter with BofA NA and BofA Securities, Inc. (collectively, BofA and JPM (JPM and BofA, collectively, the Joint Lead Arrangers ), pursuant to which the Joint Lead Arrangers have committed to amend our existing credit agreement (such amendment, the Credit Agreement Amendment to provide a new Term Loan A facility (the Acquisition Financing Facility ). The initial principal amount of the Acquisition Financing Facility will be 700 million, and the Acquisition Financing Facility will have a maturity date of two years from effective date of the Credit Agreement Amendment. Our increased indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of our common stock, including: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements; requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and putting us at a disadvantage compared to its competitors with less indebtedness. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS None. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION Amended and Restated Executive Severance Plan On December 3, 2024, the Compensation Committee of our Board approved an amended and restated AeroVironment, Inc. Executive Severance Plan (the Restated Severance Plan ). The participants in the Restated Severance Plan remain limited to Wahid Nawabi, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin McDonnell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Melissa Brown, Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and Secretary; and Brian Shackley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer (collectively, Severance Participants ). The Restated Severance Plan provides for the payment of certain benefits to each such Severance Participant in connection with the termination of the Severance Participant s employment by reason of death or disability, by the Company without cause, or by the Severance Participant for good reason, in certain cases in connection with a change in control (in each case as defined in the Restated Severance Plan), as summarized below. Except as noted below, the terms of the severance payments and other benefits provided to each of the Company s Severance Participants under the Restated Severance Plan are identical, and the Restated Severance Plan does not provide for a gross-up of severance benefits in the event that excise taxes under Section 280G of the Code are imposed on the severance benefits.

Table of Contents 
 The Restated Severance Plan provides for substantially the same severance benefits as existed under the plan prior to the restatement, except that in addition to the existing severance benefits, the Severance Participants will also be eligible to receive any earned but unpaid annual bonus for any fiscal year that has ended prior to the date of a qualifying termination. In addition, the Restated Severance Plan reflects certain additional changes to conform to the Company s current compensation program and best practices, although such changes do not impact the severance benefits to be provided. To receive the severance benefits described above, the Severance Participant must execute a full release of any and all claims against the Company and comply with certain other obligations specified in the Restated Severance Plan. The foregoing description of the Restated Severance Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Restated Severance Plan, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.3 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Executive Transaction Severance Plan provides for the payment of certain benefits to each such Transaction Severance Participant in connection with the termination of the Transaction Severance Participant s employment by the Company without cause on or prior to November 18, 2025, as summarized below. The terms of the severance payments and other benefits provided to each of the Transaction Severance Participants under the Executive Transaction Severance Plan are identical, and the Executive Transaction Severance Plan does not provide for a gross-up of severance benefits in the event that excise taxes under Section 280G of the Code are imposed on the severance benefits. Upon termination of the Transaction Severance Participant s employment by the Company without cause on or prior to November 18, 2025, the Transaction Severance Participant is entitled to receive: (i) 1.0x his base salary, (ii) provided such termination occurs outside the period starting on April 1, 2025 through and including June 30, 2025, a prorated target bonus for the fiscal year in which termination occurs, (iii) the continuation of certain employee welfare plan benefits, including for his dependents and beneficiaries, for a period of 12 months following the termination date or until the Transaction Severance Participant becomes eligible for equivalent benefits from a subsequent employer, (iv) the right to remain eligible to continue to vest in his outstanding time-based equity awards for a period of 12 months following the termination date, subject to continued transition consulting services through each applicable vesting date, and (v) outplacement services for a period of 12 months following the termination date or until the first acceptance by the Transaction Severance Participant of an offer of employment, whichever comes first. To receive the severance benefits described above, the Transaction Severance Participant must execute a full release of any and all claims against the Company and comply with certain other obligations specified in the Executive Transaction Severance Plan.

Subject to Section 11.20 , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation.

 84 13743030v1 13743030v2 

Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (f)(ii)(D) , FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date.

Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.01(g) , in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to such Loan Party pursuant to this Section 3.01(g) the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section 3.01(g) shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person. (h) Survival .

If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Lending Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or to make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit Extension, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR or Term SOFR, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to perform such obligations, to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such Credit Extension or to continue Term SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such 
 85 13743030v1 13743030v2 

illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term SOFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon SOFR or Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR or Term SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05 . 3 . 03 Inability to Determine Rates . a If in connection with any request for a Term SOFR Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (A) no Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with Section 3.03(b) , and the circumstances under clause (i) of Section 3.03(b) or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred, or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason that Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (1) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans , or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods), and (2) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Lenders described in Section 3.03(a)(ii) , until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein, and (y) any outstanding Term SOFR Loans shall be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans immediately at the end of their respective applicable Interest Periods. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that: 
 86 13743030v1 13743030v2 

(i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR, including because the Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or (ii) CME or any successor administrator of the Term SOFR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or such administrator with respect to its publication of Term SOFR, in each case acting in such capacity, has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of Dollar-denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease; provided , that , at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide such representative interest periods of Term SOFR after such specific date (the latest date on which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer available permanently or indefinitely, the Scheduled Unavailability Date or then, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, a Term SOFR Replacement Date ), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant Interest Payment Date, as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, Term SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any other Loan Document with Daily Simple SOFR, plus the SOFR Adjustment for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Administrative Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the Successor Rate ). If the Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR, plus the SOFR Adjustment, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (a) if the Administrative Agent determines that Daily Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the Term SOFR Replacement Date, or (b) if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 3.03(b)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then, in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing Term SOFR or any then-current Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 3.03(b) at the end of any Interest Period, relevant Interest Payment Date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then-existing convention for similar Dollar-denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such alternative benchmark and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then-existing convention for similar Dollar-denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmark, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments, shall constitute a Successor Rate . Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5 th Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. 
 87 13743030v1 13743030v2 

The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate. Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided , that , to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero, such Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided , that , with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. For purposes of this Section 3.03(b) , those Lenders that either have not made, or do not have an obligation under this Agreement to make, the relevant Loans in Dollars shall be excluded from any determination of Required Lenders. 3 . 04 Increased Costs . a Increased Costs Generally .

 88 13743030v1 13743030v2 

b Capital Requirements . If any Lender or any L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s policies and the policies of such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company for any such reduction suffered. c Certificates for Reimbursement .

 In no event will a termination for Cause or a voluntary termination by you without Good Reason constitute a Qualifying Termination. V. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS A. Other Plans Participation in the Plan does not enhance or reduce the amounts, if any, payable to you under any other benefit plan maintained by the Company or its affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Plan Benefits provided are intended to be and are exclusive and in lieu of any other severance and change in control benefits or payments to which a Key Employee may otherwise be entitled, either at law, tort, or contract, in equity, or under the Plan, in the event of any Qualifying Termination. In furtherance of the foregoing, a Key Employee shall not be entitled to any Plan Benefit under this Plan which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by the Key Employee under any individual agreement with the Company, or any other plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any severance or pay in lieu of notice required by applicable law or regulation, including, without limitation, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act WARN or any similar state or local statute, rule or regulation . If a Key Employee has a right to payments or benefits upon a Qualifying Termination that duplicate any Plan Benefit under this Plan, the Plan Benefits shall be reduced, dollar for dollar, by the amount of the duplicate payment(s) and benefit(s). Such reductions may be applied on a retroactive basis, with severance benefits previously paid being recharacterized as payments pursuant to a statutory obligation of the Company. Except to the extent provided above, the Plan will not affect the terms of any outstanding Equity Awards, which will be determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company equity compensation plan(s) under which they were granted and any applicable award agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Equity Award agreement(s) or the 
 12 US-DOCS\154590967.7 

equity compensation plan(s) pursuant to which your Equity Awards were granted provide for more favorable treatment of Equity Awards upon a Change in Control or a Qualifying Termination, nothing in this Plan is intended to limit your right to such more favorable treatment as provided in such Equity Award agreement(s) or equity compensation plan(s). B. Reemployment and Repayment You do not have any right to reemployment or any preferential rights for rehire as a result of participation in the Plan. C. Tax Information Your Plan Benefits are taxable to you as ordinary income. This document is not intended to provide a complete description of the tax consequences of the Plan. You are urged to consult with your personal tax advisor before making any decisions. The Company will withhold from any severance such federal and state tax withholdings and other deductions reasonably determined to be required by law, such as those made in order to comply with any court or administratively ordered garnishments from certain Plan Benefits. D. Section 280G Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, if it is determined that any payment by the Company or any other person or entity to you or for your benefit under the Plan or otherwise, in connection with, or arising out of, your service with the Company or its affiliate or a change in ownership or effective control of the Company or a substantial portion of its assets (a Payment is a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), on account of the aggregate value of the Payments due to you being equal to or greater than three times the base amount, as defined in Code Section 280G (the Parachute Threshold ), so that you would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999, and the net after-tax benefit that you would receive by reducing the Payments to the Parachute Threshold is greater than the net after-tax benefit you would receive if the full amount of the Payments were paid to you, then the Payments payable to you will be reduced (but not below zero) so that the Payments due to you do not exceed the amount of the Parachute Threshold. The foregoing reductions shall be made in a manner that results in the maximum economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis and, to the extent economically equivalent payments or benefits are subject to reduction, in a pro rata manner; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such reduction shall be undertaken in a manner that complies with and does not result in the imposition of additional taxes on you under Code Section 409A. All determinations regarding the application of this Section V.D shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting firm or consulting group with experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code selected by the Company (the Independent Advisors ). For purposes of determinations, no portion of the Payments shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of the Independent Advisors, (i) does not constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Code Section 280G(b)(4)(A)) or (ii) constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(4)(B), in excess of 
 13 US-DOCS\154590967.7 

the base amount (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(3)) allocable to such reasonable compensation. The costs of obtaining such determination and all related fees and expenses (including related fees and expenses incurred in any later audit) shall be borne by the Company. E. Section 409A The Plan is not intended to be a deferred compensation plan for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. The Plan will in all respects be interpreted, operated, and administered in accordance with this intent. Payments provided under the Plan will only be made in a manner that complies with or is exempt from Code Section 409A, including exemptions under the short-term deferral rule in Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(4), and the two-year, two-time rule described in Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(9). To the extent that any provision in this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with or exemption from Code Section 409A, the provision shall be read in such a manner that no payments payable under this Plan shall be subject to an additional tax as defined in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. For purposes of Code Section 409A, each installment payment under the Plan shall be treated as a separate payment. For purposes of the Plan, to the extent required to ensure the payments and benefits hereunder comply with, or are exempt from, Code Section 409A, all references to your termination of employment shall mean your separation from s ervice (as defined in Code Section 409A). Notwithstanding any other term or condition of the Plan, if you are a specified employee (as determined by the Company in accordance with Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(i)) as of your date of termination), then all payments and benefits that are subject to the requirements of Code Section 409A (determined after taking into account the short-term deferral rule in Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(4), the two-year, two-time rule described in Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(9), and any other available exception from such requirements) that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided under the Plan during the six-month period immediately after your separation from service (as defined in Code Section 409A) will instead be paid on the first payroll date after the six-month anniversary of your separation from service (or your death, if earlier). To the extent required by Section 409A of the Code, any reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided under this Plan shall be provided in accordance with the following: (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided during each calendar year cannot affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year; (ii) any payments in lieu of the benefits shall be paid no later than the end of your taxable year next following your taxable year in which the benefit or expense was due to be paid; and (iii) any right to reimbursements or in-kind benefits under this Plan shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another b enefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company has no obligation to take any action to prevent the assessment of any additional tax or penalty on you under Code Section 409A and the Company has any liability to you for such tax or penalty. F. Employment Issues The Plan does not constitute inducement or consideration for the employment of any employee, nor is it a contract between any employee and the Company or any of its affiliates. The Plan does not give any employee the right to continued employment. The Company and its affiliates have the right to hire and terminate any employee at any time, as if the Plan had never been established. The Plan does not provide eligible employees with any right not expressly 
 14 US-DOCS\154590967.7 

granted by its provisions, and does not provide any benefit without the execution of the Full Release. G. Assignment; Non-transferability; Successors. No right of a Key Employee to any payment or benefit under this Plan shall be subject to assignment, anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or garnishment by creditors of the Key Employee or of any beneficiary of the Key Employee. Any successor to the Company (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) or to all or substantially all of the Company s business and/or assets shall assume the obligations under this Plan and agree expressly to perform any of the Company s obligations under this Plan. For all purposes under this Plan, the term Company shall include any successor to the Company s and/or Company s business and/or assets which becomes bound by the terms of the Plan by operation of law. All of a Key Employee s rights hereunder shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, his or her personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. 
 H. Governing Law. This Plan is a welfare plan subject to ERISA and it shall be interpreted, administered, and enforced in accordance with that law. To the extent that state law is applicable, the validity, construction and effect of this Plan and any rules and regulations relating to this Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws. If any provision hereof shall be held by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue to be fully effective. 
 I. No Duty to Mitigate. No Key Employee shall be required to mitigate, by seeking employment or otherwise, the amount of any payment that the Company becomes obligated to make under this Plan, and, except as expressly provided in this Plan, amounts or other benefits to be paid or provided to a Key Employee pursuant to this Plan shall not be reduced by reason of the Key Employee s obtaining other employment or receiving similar payments or benefits from another employer.

If the Plan Administrator needs an extension, it will notify you of the reason for the extension and the date by which a decision on the claim can be expected within the initial 90-day period following receipt of your claim.

If you and/or your representative timely appeal the denied claim, the Plan Administrator will provide you with, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, and other information relevant to your claim. The Plan Administrator s review will take into account all comments, documents, records, and other documents submitted by you relating to the claim, without regard to whether the information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. Final Decision Upon receipt of a request for review, the Plan Administrator will provide written notification of its decision to you within a reasonable time period but not later than 60 days after receiving the request, unless special circumstances require an extension for processing the review. If such an extension is required, the Plan Administrator will notify you of such extension within 60 days of the date the appeal was received by the Plan Administrator, the special circumstances, and the date, no later than 120 days after the original date the review was requested, by which the Plan Administrator will notify you of its decision.

The parties shall mutually agree upon a single arbitrator within 30 days of such demand.

Any such award is subject to confirmation, modification, correction, or vacation only as explicitly provided in Title 9 of the United States Code (the Federal Arbitration Act ). The parties acknowledge that this Plan evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The Federal Arbitration Act and the Rules shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to this provision. Any provisional remedy that would be available from a court of law shall be available from the arbitrator to the parties to this Plan pending arbitration. Either party may make an application to the arbitrators seeking injunctive relief to maintain the status quo, or may seek from a court of competent jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that may be necessary to protect the rights and property of that party, until such times as the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy otherwise resolved. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the arbitrator may award fees and costs to the successful party.

Exhibit 10.3 
 Annex 2 to Release of claims DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROGRAM 1. Arbitration Procedural Rules 
 Either party may initiate an arbitration under the then-current JAMS Employment Dispute Rules and Procedures. The applicable arbitral rules are available for review at www.jamsadr.com (under the Rules/Clauses tab). 1.1. The parties will make reasonable efforts to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator chosen from the JAMS panels. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 30 days of either party s notice to the other party of a demand for arbitration, the Company will request from JAMS a list of qualified arbitrators. The parties will then select an arbitrator in accordance with JAMS Employment Dispute Rules and Procedures. Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the arbitrator shall be a practicing attorney with at least 15 years of experience and at least five years of experience as an arbitrator. 1.2. The Company and the Officer agree that the arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in the JAMS office (as applicable) closest to nearest the Officer s most recent assigned place of work (or such other location as is mutually agreed to by the parties). 1.3. The nature of the substantive claims asserted will determine which body of substantive laws will apply. In the event that there is a dispute regarding which substantive laws apply, the arbitrator shall decide that issue. 1.4. The parties agree that all proceedings before the arbitrator will remain confidential between the parties, including but not limited to any depositions, discovery, pleadings, exhibits, testimony, or award. The parties will inform third parties (including witnesses) necessary to the proceeding that the proceeding is confidential, and use reasonable efforts to secure that individual s agreement to maintain such confidentiality. The requirement of confidentiality, however, will not apply in the event that either party seeks to confirm an arbitral award and enter a judgment thereon in an appropriate court, or if any such arbitral award is appealed to an appropriate court. 
 2. Injunctive or Other Interim Relief . 
 Any provisional remedy that would be available from a court of law shall be available from the arbitrator to the parties to the Release pending arbitration. The Company or the Officer may apply to the arbitrator seeking injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under this Paragraph 2, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights of that party, pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal (or pending the arbitral tribunal s determination of the merits of the controversy). 
 Annex 2-1 US-DOCS\154590967.7 

3. Remedies, Written Decision, Fees . 
 Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief available under applicable law. At the conclusion of the arbitration, if either party requests, the arbitrator will issue a written decision that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator s award or decision is based. Any costs unique to arbitration (such as the costs of the arbitrator and room fees) will be paid by the Company and the parties will otherwise bear their own fees and costs, including attorneys fees and expert fees. The Company and the Officer acknowledge and agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or related to the Release. A successful party may make application to the arbitrator for an award of fees and/or costs and the arbitrator may award such fees and costs consistent with applicable law. 4. Application of FAA and Questions of Arbitrability . 
 The Company and the Officer agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq. FAA governs the enforceability of any and all of the arbitration provisions in the Release and/or this Exhibit. All awards made by the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and judgment may be entered based upon such award in any court of law having competent jurisdiction. Any such award is subject to confirmation, modification, correction, or vacation only as explicitly provided in Title 9 of the FAA. Questions related to procedures (including venue and choice of arbitrator), timeliness, and arbitrability (that is whether an issue is subject to arbitration under the Release and/or this Exhibit) shall be decided by the arbitrator. Claims filed must be timely, i.e., within the time set by the applicable statute(s) of limitations. 5. Administrative Remedies . 
 The parties further agree that nothing in the Release and/or this Exhibit precludes any party from filing or participating in administrative proceedings before the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, California Workers Compensation Appeals Board, California Labor Commissioner, California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, the California Department of Fair Employment Housing, or similar California or federal administrative agencies, to address alleged violations of law enforced by those agencies. If the Officer exercises such administrative remedies, the Company will not retaliate against the Officer for doing so. The Company, however, reserves the right to oppose any such administrative proceeding, including on the grounds that such agency(ies) lack jurisdiction over any dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by law, if the Officer or the Company seeks to appeal any such administrative award to a court of competent jurisdiction and/or for a trial de novo in such a court, the Officer and the Company agree that that such appeal or trial de novo is subject to the binding arbitration requirement described above in the Release and this Exhibit. 
 Annex 2-2 US-DOCS\154590967.7 

6. The Officer Understands His/Her Agreement to Arbitrate . 
 The Officer represents and warrants that he/she understands the meaning and effect of the agreement to arbitrate and has been provided reasonable time and opportunity to consult with legal counsel regarding this agreement to arbitrate.

If the Company cannot provide the foregoing benefits in a manner that is compliant with applicable law or the terms of the applicable plan, instead of providing the benefits as set forth above, the Company shall instead pay you the monthly premium amount for such benefits (determined by reference to the premiums in effect immediately prior to the Termination Date) as a taxable monthly payment for the Continuation Period (or any remaining portion thereof).

In no event will your termination of employment for any reason more than 12 months following the Effective Date or a termination for Cause or a voluntary termination by you for any reason at any time constitute a Qualifying Termination. For the avoidance of doubt, a termination of your employment by reason of your death or disability shall not constitute a Qualifying Termination. Termination Date means (a) in the case of your death, your date of death, and (b) in all other cases, the date specified in the Notice of Termination. Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, a transfer of employment from the Company to an affiliate or vice versa shall not be considered a termination of employment for purposes of this Plan. III. PLAN BENEFITS If you experience a Qualifying Termination, you will be eligible to receive the payments and benefits below, provided that you deliver to the Company a Full Release in a form satisfactory to the Company and similar to the agreement set forth in Exhibit B (with such changes as may be reasonably required to such form to help ensure its enforceability in light of any changes in applicable law) pursuant to which you fully and completely release the Company from all claims that you may have against the Company (other than any claims that may arise or have arisen under the Plan or that cannot be released under applicable law) and, with respect to the Equity Award Plan Benefits, agree to provide transition consulting services to the Company during the period described in the Full Release. The Full Release must become effective in accordance with its terms prior to the date that is 30 days (or such longer period to the extent required by applicable law, but in no event more than 60 days) following the Termination Date (including the expiration of any revocation period thereunder without your revocation of the Full Release). In the event of your Qualifying Termination, you will become eligible for the following payments and benefits: (a) in the event that your Qualifying Termination occurs at any time other than between April 1, 2025 and June 30, 2025, a Pro Rata Bonus (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if your Qualifying Termination occurs during the period commencing April 1, 2025 and ending June 30, 2025, you will not be entitled to a Pro Rata Bonus), (b) an amount equal to your Base Salary Amount, (c) Continuation Period Benefits for the Continuation Period, (d) with respect to each of your Equity Awards the vesting of which is solely service-based, the right to remain eligible to vest in the unvested portion of such Equity Award that is scheduled to vest during the 12-month period following the date of your Qualifying Termination, as determined in accordance with the vesting schedule(s) provided in the applicable Equity Award agreement, subject to your continued transition consulting services through each applicable vesting 
 4 US-DOCS\155563162.1 

date during such period as provided in the Full Release (the Equity Award Plan Benefits ). Unless otherwise determined by the Company, the date of your Qualifying Termination will, however, be considered the date of your termination of continuous service for any portion of your Equity Awards that are not eligible to vest as described in this clause (d) or the vesting of which is tied in whole or in part to performance, and notwithstanding any terms of the applicable Equity Award agreement(s) or plan to the contrary, any such awards shall no longer be eligible to vest following the Termination Date, notwithstanding your continued transition consulting services as provided in the Full Release and (e) outplacement services suitable to your position until the end of the Continuation Period (or, if earlier, when you accept an offer of employment). Your Pro Rata Bonus and Base Salary Amount will be paid in a single lump sum cash payment 30 days after the Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the applicable Equity Award agreement or equity plan) prior to your Qualifying Termination, if the Equity Award agreement or the equity plan pursuant to which your Equity Awards were granted provides for more favorable treatment of Equity Awards upon your Qualifying Termination following such Change in Control than the treatment provided in this Section III, nothing in this Plan is intended to limit your right to such more favorable treatment as provided in such Equity Award agreement or equity plan. IV. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS A. Other Plans Participation in the Plan does not enhance or reduce the amounts, if any, payable to you under any other benefit plan maintained by the Company or its affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Plan Benefits provided are intended to be and are exclusive and in lieu of any other severance benefits or payments to which a Participant may otherwise be entitled, either at law, tort, or contract, in equity, or under the Plan, in the event of any Qualifying Termination. In furtherance of the foregoing, a Participant shall not be entitled to any Plan Benefit under this Plan which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by the Participant under any individual agreement with the Company, or any other plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any severance or pay in lieu of notice required by applicable law or regulation, including, without limitation, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act WARN or any similar state or local statute, rule or regulation . If a Participant has a right to payments or benefits upon a Qualifying Termination that duplicate any Plan Benefit under this Plan, the Plan Benefits shall be reduced, dollar for dollar, by the amount of the duplicate payment(s) and benefit(s). Such reductions may be applied on a retroactive basis, with severance benefits previously paid being recharacterized as payments pursuant to a statutory obligation of the Company. 
 5 US-DOCS\155563162.1 

B. Reemployment and Repayment You do not have any right to reemployment or any preferential rights for rehire as a result of participation in the Plan. C. Tax Information Your Plan Benefits are taxable to you as ordinary income. This document is not intended to provide a complete description of the tax consequences of the Plan. You are urged to consult with your personal tax advisor before making any decisions. The Company will withhold from any severance such federal and state tax withholdings and other deductions reasonably determined to be required by law, such as those made in order to comply with any court or administratively ordered garnishments from certain Plan Benefits. D. Section 280G Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, if it is determined that any payment by the Company or any other person or entity to you or for your benefit under the Plan or otherwise, in connection with, or arising out of, your service with the Company or its affiliate or a change in ownership or effective control of the Company or a substantial portion of its assets (a Payment is a parachute payment within the meaning of Code Section 280G on account of the aggregate value of the Payments due to you being equal to or greater than three times the base amount, as defined in Code Section 280G (the Parachute Threshold ), so that you would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999, and the net after-tax benefit that you would receive by reducing the Payments to the Parachute Threshold is greater than the net after-tax benefit you would receive if the full amount of the Payments were paid to you, then the Payments payable to you will be reduced (but not below zero) so that the Payments due to you do not exceed the amount of the Parachute Threshold. The foregoing reductions shall be made in a manner that results in the maximum economic benefit to you on an after-tax basis and, to the extent economically equivalent payments or benefits are subject to reduction, in a pro rata manner; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such reduction shall be undertaken in a manner that complies with and does not result in the imposition of additional taxes on you under Code Section 409A. All determinations regarding the application of this Section V.D shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting firm or consulting group with experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Sections 280G 4999 and 280G of the Code selected by the Company (the Independent Advisors ). For purposes of determinations, no portion of the Payments shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of the Independent Advisors, (i) does not constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Code Section 280G(b)(4)(A)) or (ii) constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(4)(B), in excess of the base amount (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(3)) allocable to such reasonable compensation. The costs of obtaining such determination and all related fees and expenses (including related fees and expenses incurred in any later audit) shall be borne by the Company. E. Section 409A 
 6 US-DOCS\155563162.1 

The Plan is not intended to be a deferred compensation plan for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). The Plan will in all respects be interpreted, operated, and administered in accordance with this intent. Payments provided under the Plan will only be made in a manner that complies with or is exempt from Code Section 409A, including exemptions under the short-term deferral rule in Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(4), and the two-year, two-time rule described in Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(9). To the extent that any provision in this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with or exemption from Code Section 409A, the provision shall be read in such a manner that no payments payable under this Plan shall be subject to an additional tax as defined in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. For purposes of Code Section 409A, each installment payment under the Plan shall be treated as a separate payment. For purposes of the Plan, to the extent required to ensure the payments and benefits hereunder comply with, or are exempt from, Code Section 409A, all references to your termination of employment shall mean your separation from s ervice (as defined in Code Section 409A). Notwithstanding any other term or condition of the Plan, if you are a specified employee (as determined by the Company in accordance with Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(i)) as of your date of termination), then all payments and benefits that are subject to the requirements of Code Section 409A (determined after taking into account the short-term deferral rule in Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(4), the two-year, two-time rule described in Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(9), and any other available exception from such requirements) that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided under the Plan during the six-month period immediately after your separation from service (as defined in Code Section 409A) will instead be paid on the first payroll date after the six-month anniversary of your separation from service (or your death, if earlier). To the extent required by Section 409A of the Code, any reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided under this Plan shall be provided in accordance with the following: (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided during each calendar year cannot affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year; (ii) any payments in lieu of the benefits shall be paid no later than the end of your taxable year next following your taxable year in which the benefit or expense was due to be paid; and (iii) any right to reimbursements or in-kind benefits under this Plan shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another b enefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company has no obligation to take any action to prevent the assessment of any additional tax or penalty on you under Code Section 409A and the Company has any liability to you for such tax or penalty. F. Employment Issues The Plan does not constitute inducement or consideration for the employment of any employee, nor is it a contract between any employee and the Company or any of its affiliates. The Plan does not give any employee the right to continued employment. The Company and its affiliates have the right to hire and terminate any employee at any time, as if the Plan had never been established. The Plan does not provide eligible employees with any right not expressly granted by its provisions, and does not provide any benefit without the execution of the Full Release. G. Assignment; Non-transferability; Successors. No right of a Participant to any payment or benefit under this Plan shall be subject to assignment, anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or garnishment by creditors of the 

 7 US-DOCS\155563162.1 

Participant or of any beneficiary of the Participant. Any successor to the Company (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) or to all or substantially all of the Company s business and/or assets shall assume the obligations under this Plan and agree expressly to perform any of the Company s obligations under this Plan. For all purposes under this Plan, the term Company shall include any successor to the Company s and/or Company s business and/or assets which becomes bound by the terms of the Plan by operation of law. All of a Participant s rights hereunder shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, his or her personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. 
 H. Governing Law. This Plan is a welfare plan subject to ERISA and it shall be interpreted, administered, and enforced in accordance with that law. To the extent that state law is applicable, the validity, construction and effect of this Plan and any rules and regulations relating to this Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws. If any provision hereof shall be held by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue to be fully effective. 
 I. No Duty to Mitigate. No Participant shall be required to mitigate, by seeking employment or otherwise, the amount of any payment that the Company becomes obligated to make under this Plan, and, except as expressly provided in this Plan, amounts or other benefits to be paid or provided to a Participant pursuant to this Plan shall not be reduced by reason of the Participant s obtaining other employment or receiving similar payments or benefits from another employer. 
 J. Complete Statement of Plan.

All decisions of the Plan Administrator (including any delegate) under the Plan will be in its sole discretion and will be final and binding upon all persons. Claim Review Process for Plan Benefits
 
 The Plan has a claim review process that must be followed whenever you submit a claim for benefits under the Plan. Initial Decision When you file a claim to receive Plan Benefits, the Plan Administrator or its delegate reviews the claim and makes a decision to either approve or deny the claim (in whole or in part). If your claim is determined to be valid, you will receive benefits under the Plan as provided for in Section III of the Plan. If your claim is denied, in whole or in part, you will receive a written notice of the claim decision no later than 90 days after receipt of your claim.

Final Decision Upon receipt of a request for review, the Plan Administrator will provide written notification of its decision to you within a reasonable time period but not later than 60 days after receiving the request, unless special circumstances require an extension for processing the review. If such an extension is required, the Plan Administrator will notify you of such extension within 60 days of the date the appeal was received by the Plan Administrator, the special circumstances, and the date, no later than 120 days after the original date the review was requested, by which the Plan Administrator will notify you of its decision.

Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the arbitrator shall be a practicing attorney with at least 15 years of experience and at least five years of experience as an arbitrator. Arbitration shall occur in the JAMS office closest to Simi Valley, California or such other location as may be mutually agreed by the parties. All awards made by the arbitrators shall be final and binding, and judgment may be entered based upon such award in any court of law having competent jurisdiction.

 (b) This is a compromise settlement of all such claims and potential claims, known or unknown, and therefore this Release does not constitute either an admission of liability on the part of Employee and the Company or an admission, directly or by implication, that Employee and/or the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates or predecessors, have violated any law, rule, regulation, contractual right or any other duty or obligation. The parties hereto specifically deny that they have violated any law, rule, regulation, contractual right or any other duty or obligation.
 (c) This Release is entered into freely and voluntarily by Employee and the Company solely to avoid further costs, risks and hazards of litigation and to settle all claims and potential claims and disputes, known or unknown, in a final and binding manner.
 
 3. For and in consideration of the promises and covenants made by Employee to the Company and the Company to Employee, contained herein, Employee and the Company have agreed and do agree as follows:

 Annex 1-1 US-DOCS\155563162.1 

Employee has or may have against Releasees arising out of, relating to or resulting from any events occurring prior to the execution of this Release, including but not limited to any claims and potential claims for relief, causes of action and liabilities of any and every kind, nature and character whatsoever, known or unknown, arising out of, relating to or resulting from the employment relationship between Employee and the Company and its subsidiaries, affiliates and predecessors, and the termination of that relationship. For example, Employee is releasing all common law contract, tort, or other claims Employee might have, as well as all claims Employee might have under the ADEA, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, the Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act WARN Act ), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Sections 1981 and 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Equal Pay Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Americans With Disabilities Act ADA ), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA ), the Equal Pay Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, the California Equal Pay Law, the Moore-Brown-Roberti Family Rights Act of 1991, the California WARN Act, Cal.

In addition, this Release does not cover, and nothing in this Release shall be construed to cover, any claim that cannot be so released as a matter of applicable law.
 (b) Employee agrees that Employee will not directly or indirectly institute any legal proceedings against Releasees before any court, administrative agency, arbitrator or any other tribunal or forum whatsoever by reason of any claims and potential claims for relief, causes of action and liabilities of any and every kind, nature and character whatsoever, known or unknown, arising out of, relating to or resulting from any events occurring prior to the execution of this Release, including but not limited to any claims and potential claims for relief, causes of action and liabilities arising out of, relating to or resulting from the employment relationship between Employee and the Company and its subsidiaries, affiliates and predecessors, and/or the termination of that relationship, including any and all claims and rights under the ADEA.

However, nothing in this subsection shall prohibit Employee from complying with any lawful subpoena or court order or taking any other actions affirmatively authorized by law.
 (d) Employee has disclosed to the Company any information Employee has concerning any conduct involving the Company or any affiliate that Employee has any reason to believe may be unlawful or that involves any false claims to the United States. Employee promises to cooperate fully in any investigation the Company or any affiliate undertakes into matters occurring during Employee s employment with the Company or any affiliate.
 (e) The parties understand and agree that nothing in the Plan or this Release: (i) limits or affects Employee s right to challenge the validity of this Release, including, without 

 Exhibit B-2 US-DOCS\155563162.1 

limitation, a challenge under the ADEA (ii) in any way interferes with Employee s right and responsibility to give truthful testimony under oath or (iii) precludes Employee from participating in an investigation, filing a charge or otherwise communicating with any federal, state or local government office, official or agency, including, but not limited to, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, or the Securities and Exchange Commission. Employee agrees never to seek or accept any compensatory damages, back pay, front pay or reinstatement remedies for Employee personally with respect to any claims released by this Release; provided, however, that Employee may accept awards form the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 4. Employee agrees to continue to comply with the terms of the Full Release and the Company s standard form of confidential information and inventions assignment agreement and/or other agreements regarding non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement, confidentiality, assignment of inventions or other similar covenants between such Employee and the Company (the Restrictive Covenants ), including all post termination obligations contained therein. In addition to all other rights and remedies available to the Company under law or in equity, the Company shall be entitled to withhold all Plan Benefits payable under the Plan in the event of Employee s breach of Restrictive Covenants.
 5. During the period commencing on the Termination Date and ending on the first anniversary thereof (the Consulting End Date ), Employee agrees to provide transition consulting services to the Company (the Consulting Period ). Employee s consulting services pursuant to this Section 5 and Section 6 below shall automatically terminate on the Consulting End Date (subject to earlier termination as provided in this Section 5). Employee may terminate the Consulting Period upon thirty (30) days written notice to the Company. The Company may terminate the Consulting Period immediately in the event of Employee s material breach of this Release or the Restrictive Covenants. Employee s receipt of the Equity Award Plan Benefits under Section III of the Plan is subject to Employee s continued consulting services pursuant to this Section 5 and Section 6 below during the Consulting Period. In the event the Consulting Period terminates for any reason, the Equity Award Plan Benefits under Section III of the Plan shall cease immediately. Employee s sole compensation from the Company for any service during the Consulting Period shall be the Plan Benefits.
 6. During the Consulting Period, Employee shall use reasonable efforts to devote such percentage of his business time and effort to the performance of his services hereunder as shall be mutually agreed upon by Employee and the Company in order to provide such transitional information, advice and assistance concerning matters that are within the scope of Employee s knowledge and expertise. Notwithstanding any provision of this Release to the contrary, during the Consulting Period, Employee acknowledges that Employee is and shall at all times be an independent contractor. During the Consulting Period, Employee may engage in employment, consulting or other work relationships in addition to his work for the Company, provided that such engagements do not violate the provisions of this Release or the Restrictive Covenants. 
 7. As a material part of the consideration for this Release, Employee and Employee s agents and attorneys, agree to keep completely confidential and not disclose to any person or entity, except immediate family, attorneys, accountants, or tax preparers, or in response to a court order or subpoena, the terms and/or conditions of this Release and/or any understandings, agreements, 

 Exhibit B-3 US-DOCS\155563162.1 

provisions and/or information contained herein or with regard to the employment relationship between Employee and the Company and its subsidiaries, affiliates and predecessors.
 8. Any dispute, claim or controversy of any kind or nature, including but not limited to the issue of arbitrability, arising out of or relating to this Release, or the breach thereof, or any disputes which may arise in the future, shall be settled in a final and binding before an arbitrator appointed by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service in accordance with Annex 2 to this Release. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all reasonable attorneys fees, costs and necessary disbursements incurred in connection with the arbitration proceeding. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Company and the Employee acknowledge and agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or related to the Release. Employee further waives Employee s right to pursue claims against the Company on a class, collective, or representative action; provided, however, that Employee does not waive Employee s right, to the extent preserved by law, to pursue representative claims against the Company under the California Private Attorney General Act.
 9. It is further understood and agreed that Employee has not relied upon any advice whatsoever from the Company and/or its attorneys individually and/or collectively as to the taxability, whether pursuant to Federal, State or local income tax statutes or regulations, or otherwise, of the consideration transferred hereunder and that Employee will be solely liable for all of Employee s tax obligations. Employee understands and agrees that the Company or its subsidiaries, affiliates or predecessors, may be required by law to report all or a portion of the amounts paid to Employee and/or Employee s attorney in connection with this Release to federal and state taxing authorities. Employee waives, releases, forever discharges and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Company harmless with respect to any actual or potential tax obligations imposed by law.
 10. Employee acknowledges that Employee has read, understood and truthfully completed the Business Ethics and Conduct Disclosure Statement attached hereto as Annex 1 .
 11. It is further understood and agreed that Releasees and/or their attorneys shall not be further liable either jointly and/or severally to Employee and/or Employee s attorneys individually or collectively for costs and/or attorneys fees, including any provided for by statute, nor shall Employee and/or Employee s attorneys be liable either jointly and/or severally to the Company and/or its attorneys individually and/or collectively for costs and/or attorneys fees, including any provided for by statute.

 A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY, AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. 19.

 Annex 2-1 US-DOCS\155563162.1 

Exhibit 10.4 
 Annex 2 to Exhibit A DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROGRAM 1. Arbitration Procedural Rules 
 Either party may initiate an arbitration under the then-current JAMS Employment Dispute Rules and Procedures. The applicable arbitral rules are available for review at www.jamsadr .com (under the Rules/Clauses tab). 1.1. The parties will make reasonable efforts to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator chosen from the JAMS panels. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 30 days of either party s notice to the other party of a demand for arbitration, the Company will request from JAMS a list of qualified arbitrators. The parties will then select an arbitrator in accordance with JAMS Employment Dispute Rules and Procedures. Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the arbitrator shall be a practicing attorney with at least 15 years of experience and at least five years of experience as an arbitrator. 1.2. The Company and the Employee agree that the arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in the JAMS office (as applicable) closest to nearest the Employee s most recent assigned place of work (or such other location as is mutually agreed to by the parties). 1.3. The nature of the substantive claims asserted will determine which body of substantive laws will apply. In the event that there is a dispute regarding which substantive laws apply, the arbitrator shall decide that issue. 1.4. The parties agree that all proceedings before the arbitrator will remain confidential between the parties, including but not limited to any depositions, discovery, pleadings, exhibits, testimony, or award. The parties will inform third parties (including witnesses) necessary to the proceeding that the proceeding is confidential, and use reasonable efforts to secure that individual s agreement to maintain such confidentiality. The requirement of confidentiality, however, will not apply in the event that either party seeks to confirm an arbitral award and enter a judgment thereon in an appropriate court, or if any such arbitral award is appealed to an appropriate court. 
 2. Injunctive or Other Interim Relief . 
 Any provisional remedy that would be available from a court of law shall be available from the arbitrator to the parties to the Release pending arbitration. The Company or the Employee may apply to the arbitrator seeking injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under this Paragraph 2, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights of that party, pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal (or pending the arbitral tribunal s determination of the merits of the controversy). 
 Annex 2-1 US-DOCS\155563162.1 

3. Remedies, Written Decision, Fees . 
 Final resolution of any dispute through arbitration may include any remedy or relief available under applicable law. At the conclusion of the arbitration, if either party requests, the arbitrator will issue a written decision that sets forth the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator s award or decision is based. Any costs unique to arbitration (such as the costs of the arbitrator and room fees) will be paid by the Company and the parties will otherwise bear their own fees and costs, including attorneys fees and expert fees. The Company and the Employee acknowledge and agree that they are hereby waiving any rights to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties against the other in connection with any matter whatsoever arising out of or related to the Release. A successful party may make application to the arbitrator for an award of fees and/or costs and the arbitrator may award such fees and costs consistent with applicable law. 4. Application of FAA and Questions of Arbitrability . 
 The Company and the Employee agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq. FAA governs the enforceability of any and all of the arbitration provisions in the Release and/or this Exhibit. All awards made by the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and judgment may be entered based upon such award in any court of law having competent jurisdiction. Any such award is subject to confirmation, modification, correction, or vacation only as explicitly provided in Title 9 of the FAA. Questions related to procedures (including venue and choice of arbitrator), timeliness, and arbitrability (that is whether an issue is subject to arbitration under the Release and/or this Exhibit) shall be decided by the arbitrator. Claims filed must be timely, i.e., within the time set by the applicable statute(s) of limitations. 5. Administrative Remedies . 
 The parties further agree that nothing in the Release and/or this Exhibit precludes any party from filing or participating in administrative proceedings before the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, California Workers Compensation Appeals Board, California Labor Commissioner, California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, the California Department of Fair Employment Housing, or similar California or federal administrative agencies, to address alleged violations of law enforced by those agencies. If the Employee exercises such administrative remedies, the Company will not retaliate against the Employee for doing so. The Company, however, reserves the right to oppose any such administrative proceeding, including on the grounds that such agency(ies) lack jurisdiction over any dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by law, if the Employee or the Company seeks to appeal any such administrative award to a court of competent jurisdiction and/or for a trial de novo in such a court, the Employee and the Company agree that that such appeal or trial de novo is subject to the binding arbitration requirement described above in the Release and this Exhibit. 
 Annex 2-2 US-DOCS\155563162.1 

6. The Employee Understands His/Her Agreement to Arbitrate . 
 The Employee represents and warrants that he/she understands the meaning and effect of the agreement to arbitrate and has been provided reasonable time and opportunity to consult with legal counsel regarding this agreement to arbitrate.
