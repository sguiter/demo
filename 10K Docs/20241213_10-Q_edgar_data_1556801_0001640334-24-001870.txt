F-16 Table of Contents Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We were formerly classified as a shell company and have since transitioned into active operations following the acquisition of RAC Real Estate Acquisition Corp. ("RAC"). We no longer maintain the status of a shell company due to these developments. In July 2022, we acquired RAC, a Wyoming-based corporation, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Through RAC, the Company focuses on real estate transactions, particularly the acquisition, development, and sale or rental of low-income housing. Our investment approach is segmented into three primary areas: Acquiring, refurbishing, and selling traditional foreclosures; Purchasing, developing, and renting properties in "Land Banks," which typically comprise over 100 homes or lots in a single location; Acquiring, refurbishing, or developing homes available through HECM (Home Equity Conversion Mortgage) pools. On January 31, 2023, the Company changed its corporate name to My City Builders, Inc., through the merger of the Company with its wholly owned subsidiary, My City Builders, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the Subsidiary ). Pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger between the Company and the Subsidiary, the Subsidiary was merged with and into the Company and the Company s name was changed to My City Builders, Inc.

On April 25, 2024, RAC finalized the purchase of two additional lots in Gadsden, Alabama bringing the total properties owned in East Gadsden to twenty-two. This decision stemmed from the ongoing construction of three homes by RAC on the same street, slated for completion. With the aim of bolstering rental demand, RAC has started construction on these newly acquired lots. The homes are 3-bedroom 2-bathroom single family homes with under roof of 1270 square feet. The plan for Gadsden Alabama is to build new low-income single-family homes for rent. On July 31, 2024, RAC Gadsden LLC entered into a land purchase agreement in Glencoe Alabama. Glencoe is the neighboring town to Gadsden, and the Company plans to build seven to eight duplex apartments on the parcel of land during the calendar year of 2025. 5 Table of Contents As of October 31 , 2024, RAC has completed eleven homes and three homes under construction in East Gadsden and has seven of the eleven completed properties leased with monthly lease payments of 1,100 to 1,250, each for a period of one year for each home leased.

Going Concern Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the three months ended October 31, 2024, we incurred net loss of 74,485 and net cash used in operating activities of 159,601. As of October 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 2,094,394 and working capital deficit of 149,043. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management plans to raise necessary funding through equity and debt financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. The ability of the Company to continue operations in its new business model is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining financing to continue operations and continue developing the business plan. The Company cannot give any assurance as to the ability to develop or operate profitably. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 7 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies Use of Estimates: The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that directly affect the results of reported assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, including the valuation of non-cash transactions. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Topic 606, which requires the Company to recognize revenues when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue based on the five criteria for revenue recognition established under Topic 606: (i) Identify the contract, or contracts, with a tenant; (ii) Identify the performance obligations in the rental contract; (iii) Determine the transaction price; (iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (v) Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Rental income The Company generated rental income from operating leases, which is accounted for under ASC 842. Operating lease revenue is generally recognized on straight-line basis over the terms of the lease agreements. Cost of rental homes The cost of rental homes are expenses directly related to rental homes, such as lawncare, maintenance and repairs, management fees, utilities, insurance and property taxes. Commitments and Contingencies The Company follows ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies , to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company has implemented all new pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or results of operations. Nonmonetary Transactions The Company follows ASC 450, Non-Monetary Transactions and considers ASC 450-30 Contingencies , to report accounting for recognition homes inventory for sales and nonmonetary gain on settlement of lawsuit. 8 Table of Contents Concentration As of October 31, 2024, and July 31, 2024, and for three months ended October 31, 2024, and 2023, customer concentrations (more than 10 were as follows: Revenue -rental income Percentage of Revenue For Three Months ended October 31, 2024 2023 Tenant A 12.93 - Tenant B - 40.52 Tenant C - 59.48 Tenant D 14.69 - Tenant E 15.44 - Tenant F 15.06 - Tenant G 14.70 - Tenant H 14.10 - Total (as a group) 86.92 100.00 Accounts receivable The rental properties are managed by a management company during the three months ended October 31, 2024, and the year ended July 31, 2024, therefore 100 of accounts receivable is related to one customer at October 31, 2024, and July 31, 2024. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As a smaller reporting company, we have elected not to provide the disclosure required by this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures Disclosure Controls ), as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of October 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The Disclosure Controls evaluation was done under supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that, due to the inadequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and our limited internal audit function, our disclosure controls were not effective as of October 31, 2024, such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the president and treasurer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting As reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2024, management has determined that our internal controls contain material weaknesses due to the absence of segregation of duties, as well as lack of qualified accounting personnel and excessive reliance on third party consultants for accounting, financial reporting and related activities. Currently we have two principal executive officers, that serve as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and also directors of the company. Both executive officers do not have an accounting background which makes it unlikely that we will be able to implement effective internal controls over financial reporting in the near future. During the period ended October 31, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 9 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. On March 23, 2023, RAC was awarded a judgement from the District Court in Clark County Nevada enabling the company to cancel common shares held in the name of HUI PING LIU. These shares were originally issued to HUI PING LIU for no consideration by our former CEO Daniel Tsai. On May 19, 2023, RAC filed a complaint for breach of two promissory notes entered into with Fix Pads Holdings, LLC and for injunctive relief in the 11 th Judicial Circuit Court in Miami-Dade County Florida, as well as an emergency motion for temporary injunction enjoining Fix Pads Holdings, LLC from selling, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any real property assets pledged as collateral in relation to the two promissory notes entered into between RAC and Fix Pads. In addition to the injunctive relief sought above, RAC is also seeking damages for breach of the promissory notes. After RAC filed and served the lawsuit, Fix Pads removed the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on May 24, 2023. As such, the case is now proceeding in the Southern District of Florida. RAC has obtained temporary injunctive relief against Fix Pads. On July 7, 2023, RAC filed a complaint for appointment of receiver, breach of LLC agreement, and breach of fiduciary duty in the 11 th Judicial Circuit Court of Miami-Dade County, Florida against Fix Pads Holdings LLC, FixPads Management, LLC and RAC FixPads II, LLC. RAC seeks a receiver to be appointed to wind up the real property assets of RAC FixPads II, LLC and for damages for breach of the joint venture agreement. In June 2024, the parties entered into two settlement agreements, which FixPads Holdings LLC and the other defendants agreed to transfer the title of 44 properties to the Company. Pursuant to title search and settlement of taxes and due related to properties, the Company proceeded to obtain the quitclaim deed certificate of 29 properties. RAC has started the renovation and completion of the properties since July 2024. All twenty-nine homes will be immediately placed for sale once fully renovated. On July 23, 2024, as part of the settlement agreements RAC paid 185,238.37 as part of the proceeds owed to Frank Campanero on the secured loans dated July 22, 2022, and August 18, 2022. Item 1A.
