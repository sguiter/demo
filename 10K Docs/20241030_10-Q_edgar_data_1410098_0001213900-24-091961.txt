Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial information
and the notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on March 12, 2024. 

Forward Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are subject to

Risks Related to our
Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital 

We have a history of operating losses, may incur additional operating losses in the future and may never be profitable. 

We may need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements, which may not be on terms favorable to us or our stockholders and may require us to relinquish valuable rights. 

Risks Related
to the Commercialization of DefenCath 

We are highly dependent on the successful commercialization of our only approved product, DefenCath. 

The successful commercialization of DefenCath will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of DefenCath from third-party payors. 

Our current sales of DefenCath
is highly concentrated with one customer. We have signed additional agreements with new customers that have not yet begun
purchasing DefenCath. The failure of one or more of these customers to purchase the product may adversely impact the commercial
success of DefenCath. See the risk factor under the heading We have significant customer concentration, with a limited
number of customers accounting for a large portion of our revenues in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for additional information. 

If we are unable to effectively retain and equip our sales force, our ability to successfully commercialize DefenCath will be harmed. 

Risks Related
to the Development and Commercialization of our Other Products 

Successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is uncertain. 

Final approval by regulatory authorities of our product candidates for commercial use may be delayed, limited or prevented, any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues. 

19 

Risks
Related to Healthcare Regulatory and Legal Compliance Matters 

DefenCath, and our product candidates (if approved), will be subject to extensive post-approval regulation. 

Current healthcare laws and regulations in the U.S. and future legislative or regulatory reforms to the U.S. healthcare system may affect our ability to commercialize DefenCath and future marketed products profitably. 

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and the collection and processing of personal data. Failure to maintain compliance with these regulations could create additional liabilities for us. 

Clinical trials required for our new product candidates or for expanded uses of DefenCath will be expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain. 

Risks Related
to Our Business and Industry 

Healthcare institutions, physicians and patients may not accept or use our products. 

Competition and technological change may make our products and technologies less attractive or obsolete. 

Healthcare policy changes, including reimbursement policies for drugs and medical devices, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If we lose key management or scientific personnel, cannot recruit qualified employees, directors, officers, or other personnel or experience increases in compensation costs, our business may materially suffer. 

Changes in funding for the FDA and other government agencies or future government shutdowns or disruptions could cause delays in the submission and regulatory review of marketing applications, including supplements, which could negatively impact our business or prospects. 

If we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel or maintain existing personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed. 

We may not successfully manage our growth. 

We face the risk of product liability claims and the amount of insurance coverage we hold now or in the future may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we might incur. 

We may be exposed to liability claims associated with the use of hazardous materials and chemicals. 

If we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business. 

Negative U.S. and global economic conditions may pose challenges to our business strategy, which relies on funding from the financial markets or collaborators. 

Risks Related
to Our Intellectual Property 

If we materially breach or default under the ND License Agreement with NDP, NDP would have the right to terminate the ND License Agreement, which would materially harm our business. 

If we do not obtain protection for and successfully defend our respective intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing products. 

Intellectual property disputes could require us
 to spend time and money to address such disputes and could limit our intellectual property rights. 

20 

If we infringe the rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products and forced to pay damages and defend against litigation. 

Risks Related
to Dependence on Third Parties 

If we or our collaborators are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities or experience quality or manufacturing problems, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and we may lose potential revenues. 

We depend on third party suppliers and contract manufacturers for the manufacturing of DefenCath and all key active pharmaceutical ingredients APIs ), which subjects us to potential cost increases and manufacturing delays that are not within our control. 

We currently have one FDA approved supplier for each of our key APIs, taurolidine and heparin, respectively, as well as two currently FDA approved manufacturing sites for DefenCath finished dosage. 

Corporate and academic collaborators may take actions that delay, prevent, or undermine the success of new development products or expanded uses of DefenCath. As our product is a new chemical entity NCE and the first and only in its class, we may depend on nationally-recognized disease management guidelines to assist in the adoption and implementation of DefenCath. 

Data provided by collaborators and others upon which we rely that has not been independently verified could turn out to be false, misleading or incomplete. 

We may rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and pre-clinical studies. If those parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our product candidates may not advance in a timely manner or at all. 

Risks Related
to Our Common Stock 

Our executive officers and directors may sell shares of their stock, and these sales could adversely affect our stock price. 

Our common stock price has fluctuated considerably and is likely to remain volatile, and you could lose all or a part of your investment. 

A significant number of additional shares of our common stock may be issued at a later date, and their sale could depress the market price of our common stock. 

Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult. 

If we fail to comply with the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Market, it may result in a delisting of our common stock from the exchange. 

Laws, rules and regulations relating to public companies may be costly and impact our ability to attract and retain directors and executive officers. 

Our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent all possible errors that could occur. 

Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. 

We do not currently pay dividends on our common stock so any returns on our common stock may be limited to the value of our common stock. 

We are a smaller reporting company and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to such companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.

Overview 

CorMedix Inc. (collectively,
with our wholly owned subsidiaries, referred to herein as we, us, our or the Company is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products of life-threatening diseases and conditions. 

Our primary focus is on commercializing
our lead product, DefenCath (taurolidine and heparin), in the U.S. The name DefenCath is the U.S. proprietary name approved
by the FDA. 

DefenCath is an antimicrobial
catheter lock solution CLS (a formulation of taurolidine 13.5 mg/mL, and heparin 1000 USP Units/mL) indicated to reduce
the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections CRBSI in adult patients with kidney failure receiving chronic
hemodialysis through a central venous catheter CVC ). It is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients.
CRBSIs can lead to treatment delays and increased costs to the healthcare system when they occur due to hospitalizations, need for IV
antibiotic treatment, long-term anticoagulation therapy, removal/replacement of the CVC, related treatment costs, as well as increased
mortality. We believe DefenCath can address a significant unmet medical need. 

On November 15, 2023, we announced
that the FDA approved the NDA for DefenCath to reduce the incidence of CRBSI in adult patients with kidney failure receiving chronic hemodialysis
through a CVC. DefenCath is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients. DefenCath is the first and only FDA-approved
antimicrobial CLS in the U.S. and was shown to reduce the risk of CRBSI by up to 71 in a Phase 3 clinical study. As a result of
the November 2023 FDA approval, CorMedix launched the product commercially in April 2024 in the inpatient setting and July 2024 in the
outpatient hemodialysis setting. 

DefenCath is listed in the
Orange Book as having NCE exclusivity (5 years) expiring on November 15, 2028, and the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now or GAIN exclusivity
extension of the NCE exclusivity (an additional 5 years) expiring on November 15, 2033. The GAIN exclusivity extension of 5 years is the
result of the January 2015 designation of DefenCath as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product QIDP ). 

We announced on April 26,
2023 that following the submission of a duplicate New Technology Add-On Payment NTAP application in the fourth quarter
of 2022 to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS ), CMS has subsequently issued the Inpatient Prospective Payment
System IPPS 2024 proposed rule that includes a NTAP per hospital stay for DefenCath. This NTAP represents reimbursement
to inpatient facilities of 75 of the wholesaler acquisition cost WAC price per 3 mL vial, and an average utilization
of 19.5 vials per hospital stay. The final IPPS rule was published in early August 2023 and subsequently amended as of October 1, 2024
to reflect the current WAC of 249.99 per 3ml vial. 

On January 25, 2024, CMS determined
that DefenCath should be classified as a renal dialysis service that is subject to the Medicare end-stage renal disease prospective payment
system ESRD PPS ). The ESRD PPS provides bundled payment for renal dialysis services, but also affords a transitional drug
add-on payment adjustment, or TDAPA, which provides temporary, additional payments for certain new drugs and biologicals. We submitted
an application for TDAPA on January 26, 2024, and received confirmation that our application was approved on April 18, 2024. We also submitted
a HCPCS application for a J-code to CMS on December 8, 2023, for DefenCath, which is relevant to billing and the TDAPA application. The
HCPCS J-code for DefenCath was published by CMS on April 2, 2024. TDAPA reimbursement is calculated based on 100 percent ASP (or 100 percent
of wholesale acquisition price or manufacturers list price, respectively, if such data is unavailable). TDAPA and post-TDAPA add-on
payment adjustments for DefenCath apply for five years (with such add-on payments applying to all ESRD PPS payments for years three through
five). CMS confirmed a July 1, 2024 implementation date for HCPCS and TDAPA. 

We announced on June 6, 2024
that the CMS has determined that DefenCath qualified for pass-through status under the hospital Out-Patient Prospective Payment System OPPS ). Pass-through status provides for separate payment under Medicare Part B for the utilization of DefenCath in the
outpatient ambulatory setting for a period of at least two years, and up to a maximum of three years. While vascular access for hemodialysis
can be initiated in an inpatient setting, ambulatory surgical centers or vascular access centers offer a less-invasive, outpatient-based
alternative for patients. We estimate that up to 100,000 HD-CVC placements occur each year, and pass-through status offers providers a
separate reimbursement mechanism in this setting of care administration of DefenCath. 

22 

Subsequent to the launch of
DefenCath in April 2024, the Company announced U.S.-based multi-year commercial supply agreements consisting of a large and several mid-sized
dialysis organizations. Each provider has customized an implementation plan to provide access to patients based on a variety of clinical
and other factors. The Company believes the currently contracted customer base represents roughly 60 of the outpatient dialysis centers
in the U.S. 

We
may pursue additional indications for DefenCath use as a CLS in populations with unmet medical needs that may also represent potentially
significant market opportunities. While we are continuing to assess these areas, potential future indications may include use as a CLS
to reduce CRBSIs in total parenteral nutrition patients using a central venous catheter and in certain oncology patients using a central
venous catheter. In June 2024, we announced that the FDA provided feedback to our request to discuss development plans for additional
indications for DefenCath. In response to these comments, we created and submitted three clinical protocols specifically, the post-marketing
requirement of a pediatric hemodialysis HD study as an obligation under the Pediatric Research Equity Act PREA a Phase 3 study protocol to reduce the risk of central-line associated bloodstream infections CLABSI for adult patients
receiving total parenteral nutrition TPN through a CVC and Expanded Access Program EAP to FDA that allows
for pediatric and adult patients, utilizing a CVC for the treatment or maintenance of many serious illness, to access DefenCath to protect
their central line from serious infection. The Company expects the EAP to be available to patients at the end of 2024 and to begin enrollment
for the adult TPN and pediatric HD studies in early 2025. We currently have one FDA
approved source for each of our two key APIs for DefenCath, taurolidine and heparin sodium, respectively. With regards to taurolidine,
we have a drug master file DMF filed with the FDA. There is a master commercial supply agreement between a third-party
manufacturer which has been in place since August 2018. We are currently in the process of identifying potential alternate third-party
manufacturers for taurolidine under our existing DMF. In addition, we are working with our existing manufacture to source sufficient quantities
of taurolidine API to cover at least 24 months of potential future demand. With respect to heparin sodium API, we have identified an alternate
third-party supplier and intend to qualify such supplier under the DefenCath NDA over the next twelve months. 

We received FDA approval of
DefenCath with finished dosage production from our European based contract manufacturing organization CMO Rovi Pharma
Industrial Services. We believe this CMO has adequate capacity to produce the volumes needed to meet near-term projected demand for the
commercial launch of DefenCath. We have also qualified Siegfried Hameln as an alternate finished dosage manufacturing site. 

We announced on May 1, 2023
that the USPTO allowed our patent application directed to a locking solution composition for treating and reducing infection and flow
reduction in central venous catheters. This application was granted on August 29, 2023 as U.S. Patent No. 11,738,120. Our newly
granted U.S. Patent reflects the unique and proprietary formulation of our product, DefenCath, for which we received FDA approval on November
15, 2023. This patent supplements the coverage of our existing licensed U.S. Patent No. 7,696,182, and has the potential to provide an
additional layer of patent protection for DefenCath through 2042. 

As part of the DefenCath approval
letter, the FDA communicated the existence of a required pediatric assessment under the PREA. PREA requires sponsors to conduct pediatric
studies for, among other things, NDAs for a new active ingredient, such as taurolidine in DefenCath, unless a waiver or deferral is obtained
from the FDA. A deferral acknowledges that a pediatric assessment is required but permits the applicant to submit the pediatric assessment
after the submission of an NDA. FDA deferred submission of the pediatric study for DefenCath because the product is ready for approval
for use in adults and the pediatric study has not been completed. We are currently obligated to conduct the study communicated in the
approval letter: an open-label, two-arm (DefenCath vs. standard of care) study to assess safety and time to CRBSI in subjects from birth
to less than 18 years of age with kidney failure receiving hemodialysis via a central venous catheter. We announced in June 2024 that
the FDA confirmed its requirement that we conduct a study in pediatric HD patients under the PREA. Because this is a required post-marketing
study, we would be required to make annual reports to the FDA. Pediatric studies for an approved product conducted under PREA may qualify
for pediatric exclusivity, which, if granted, provides an additional six months of exclusivity that attaches to the end of existing marketing
exclusivity and patent periods for DefenCath. Depending on the timing of final report submission, DefenCath could potentially receive
a total marketing exclusivity period of 10.5 years. However, there are factors that could affect whether this exclusivity is received
or the duration of exclusivity, and DefenCath may or may not ultimately be eligible for the additional 0.5 years of exclusivity associated
with this pediatric study. 

We previously marketed and
sold Neutrolin, a CLS product where we received CE-Mark approval for commercial distribution in the EU and other territories. We previously
elected to discontinue sales of Neutrolin for lack of commercial viability. The winding down of our operations in the EU is nearly complete
and Neutrolin sales in both the EU and the Middle East have been discontinued since 2022. 

23 

Financial Operations Overview 

Revenues 

Our ability to continue to
generate revenue and become profitable depends on our ability to successfully commercialize DefenCath and achieve gross profits from DefenCath
sales that are greater than our ongoing operating costs. If we fail to successfully commercialize DefenCath, or any other product candidates
we advance in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations
and financial position, could be adversely affected. Through September 30, 2024, we have funded our operations primarily through equity
financings. 

Cost of Revenues 

Cost of revenues include direct
and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of DefenCath, including product cost, packaging services, freight,
amortization of the license intangible asset and an allocation of overhead costs that are primarily fixed such as salaries, benefits and
insurance. 

Research and Development Expense 

Research and development,
or R D, expense consists of: (i) internal costs associated with our development activities; (ii) payments we make to third party contract
research organizations, contract manufacturers, investigative sites, and consultants; (iii) technology and intellectual property license
costs; (iv) manufacturing development costs; (v) personnel related expenses, including salaries, stock based compensation expense,
benefits, travel and related costs for the personnel involved in drug development; (vi) activities relating to regulatory filings and
pre-clinical studies and clinical trials; (vii) facilities and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for
rent, facility maintenance, as well as laboratory and other supplies; and (viii) comparative period costs include certain pre-NDA manufacturing-related
costs expensed as R D. All R D is expensed as incurred. 

The process of conducting
pre-clinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. The probability of success
for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the quality of the product
candidate s early clinical data, investment in the program, competition, manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability. As
a result of the uncertainties associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process, we are unable
to determine the duration and completion costs of future clinical stages of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will
generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our future product candidates. 

Development timelines, probability
of success and development costs vary widely. We are currently focused on the commercialization of DefenCath in the U.S. 

Selling and Marketing Expense 

Selling and marketing, or
S M, expense includes the cost of salaries and related costs for personnel in sales and marketing, brand building, advocacy, market
research and consulting. Selling and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred. 

General and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative,
or G A, expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions
including payroll taxes and health insurance, stock-based compensation and travel expenses. Other general and administrative expenses
include facility-related costs, insurance and professional fees for legal, patent review, consulting, and accounting services. General
and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Transaction Gain
(Loss) 

Foreign currency exchange
transaction gain (loss) is the result of re-measuring transactions denominated in a currency other than our functional currency and is
reported in the consolidated statement of operations as a separate line item within other income (expense). The intercompany loans outstanding
between our New Jersey-based company and our subsidiaries will not be repaid and the nature of the funding advanced was of a long-term
investment nature. As such, unrealized foreign exchange movements related to long-term intercompany loans are recorded in other comprehensive
income (loss). 

24 

Interest Income 

Interest income consists of
interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense consists
of interest incurred on financing of expenditures.

Revenues. Revenue increased
by 11.5 million and 12.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue consists of sales of DefenCath, which
was approved by the FDA in November 2023 and launched in the U.S in April 2024 and reflects the shipment of DefenCath to direct customers
and specialty distributors, net of estimates for applicable variable consideration, which consists primarily of distribution service fees,
prompt pay and other discounts, product returns, chargebacks, rebates and volume incentive rebates. 

Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues include direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of DefenCath, including product cost,
packaging services, freight, amortization of the license intangible asset and an allocation of overhead costs that are primarily fixed
such as salaries, benefits and insurance. We expect these relatively fixed costs to become less significant as a percentage of net sales
with anticipated sales volume increases. Direct costs of product sales during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are minimal
as DefenCath sold to date, represents validation lot units previously expensed as R D. The pre-approval validation batch product previously
expensed as R D will positively impact margins throughout 2024 or until such inventory is depleted. Indirect costs of approximately
 0.6 million for the three months and 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, represent the proportion
of salaries, benefits and insurance expenses representing excess capacity pertaining to pre-launch related activities. Included in the
indirect costs previously expensed as a component of R D were 0.2 million and 0.7 million of personnel expenses for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

25 

Research
and Development Expense . R D expense was 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.0 million,
or 73 , from 2.7 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, R D expense was 2.2 million,
compared to 10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 8.7 million, or 80 . The decrease for both comparison
periods was driven by the approval of DefenCath. As a result of the post FDA approval commercial operations, costs related to medical
affairs and certain personnel expenses that supported R D efforts prior to the FDA approval of DefenCath have been recognized in
cost of revenue or general and administrative expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same
period last year that were recognized in R D. In the prior three and nine month periods, there were 0.1 million and 1.5 million,
respectively, of costs related to the manufacturing of DefenCath validation batches previously expensed as a component of R D prior
to the FDA approval. These types of costs are now capitalized in inventory as DefenCath is a commercialized product. Additionally, there
were 1.9 million and 5.8 million in personnel and consulting expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively,
previously expensed as a component of R D prior to FDA approval, are now expensed in cost of revenue and G A. 

Selling and Marketing Expense.
 S M expense was 6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.7 million, or 66 . For the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, S M expense increased 10.5 million to 20.5 million, an increase of 106 . The increase in both periods
was due primarily to increased marketing efforts and new personnel, inclusive of our sales force and support for the commercial launch
of DefenCath in the third quarter of 2024. 

General and Administrative
Expense . G A expense was 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.9 million, or 76 , from
 3.7 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, G A expense was 22.9 million, compared to
 12.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 10.4 million, or 83 . The increase for both comparison periods
was driven by the approval of DefenCath. As a result of the post FDA approval commercial operations, certain personnel and consulting
expenses that supported R D efforts prior to the FDA approval of DefenCath have been recognized in G A expense during the three
months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period last year that were recognized in R D. In the prior
three and nine month periods, certain personnel and consulting expenses previously expensed as a component of R D prior to the FDA
approval of 1.7 million and 5.1 million, respectively, are now expensed in G A. Additionally, there were increases in personnel
expenses of 0.7 million and 2.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, in preparation for support
activities pertaining to commercial launch, as well as increases in legal and compliance of 0.2 million and 1.5 million and, consulting
fees of 0.1 million and 0.6 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

Interest Income . Interest
income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.6 million a decrease of 0.2 million, or 28 , compared to 0.8 million for
the same period last year, due to lower short-term investments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income was 2.1
million compared to 1.8 million for the same period last year, an increase of 0.3 million, or 17 , attributable to higher interest rates
in short-term investments during this period as compared to the same period last year. 

Foreign Exchange Transaction
Loss . Foreign exchange transaction losses were due to the re-measuring of transactions denominated in a currency other than our functional
currency. Balances and changes were immaterial for all periods presented. 

Other Income. Other
income relates to a settlement with a previously utilized vendor, occurring during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. 

Interest Expense . Interest
expense pertains to certain liabilities we chose to finance. Balances and changes were immaterial for all periods presented. 

Other Comprehensive (Loss)
Income . Unrealized foreign exchange movements related to long-term intercompany loans, the translation of the foreign affiliate financial
statements to U.S. dollars and unrealized movements related to short-term investment are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income.
Income and (loss) is considered immaterial for all periods presented.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources of Liquidity 

As a result of our R D,
S M and G A expenditures and the lack of substantial product sales revenue, our ongoing operations have not been profitable since
our inception. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds of 13.4 million from the issuance of 2,521,121
shares of common stock under our at-the-market-issuance sales agreement, or ATM program, as compared to 12.5 million net proceeds for
the same period in 2023 from the issuance of 2,866,421 shares of common stock. Also, for the same period in 2023, we received net proceeds
of 42.0 million from the issuance of 9,000,093 shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,500,625 shares of common
stock in connection with the public offering. We may continue to be reliant on external sources of cash until we are able to generate
sufficient working capital to fund operations. 

In March 2024, we received
 1.4 million, net of expenses, from the sale of our unused New Jersey net operating losses NOL ), that was eligible for
sale under the State of New Jersey s Economic Development Authority s New Jersey Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer
program NJEDA Program ). The NJEDA Program allowed us to sell our available NOL tax benefits for the state fiscal year 2023
in the amount of approximately 1.5 million. 

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 45.0 million compared to 27.7 million for the same period in 2023, an increase
of 17.3 million. The increase is primarily driven by an increase in trade receivables of 17.4 million and inventories of 4.5 million
offset by a net increase in the change of accrued expenses and accounts payable of 3.7 million. 

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing
Activities 

Net cash provided by investing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 21.5 million as compared to 17.7 million of net cash used in investing
activities for the same period in 2023. The net cash provided during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was mainly driven by an
increase in maturity of the amount invested in short-term investments to help fund operations, partially offset by lower purchase of short-term
investments in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. 

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 15.0 million as compared to 55.4 million for the same period in 2023, a
decrease of 40.4 million. The decrease was mainly attributable to 42.9 million of net proceeds from a public offering completed in the
three month period ended September 30, 2023 offset by increased ATM net proceeds of 0.9 million and increases in proceeds from the exercise
of stock options of 1.6 million during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. 

Funding Requirements and Liquidity 

Our total cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024, was 46.0 million, excluding restricted cash of 0.1 million, compared with 76.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2023, excluding restricted cash of 0.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, 36.0 million of the
Company s common stock remains available for sale under the ATM program. Additionally, we have 100 million of remaining capacity
available under our 2024 Shelf Registration Statement for the issuance of Company securities. 

Because our business has not
generated positive operating cash flow, we may need to raise additional capital in order to continue to fund our research and development
activities, as well as to fund operations generally. Our continued operations are focused on the commercial launch of DefenCath and we
can provide no assurances that financing or strategic relationships will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if additional funds
are needed. 

We expect to continue to fund
operations from cash collections from accounts receivable, plus cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and through capital
raising sources as previously described, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders. In May 2024, we implemented an ATM program, which
may be utilized to support our ongoing funding requirements. Additionally, we may enter into a credit facility in case necessary to support
ongoing working capital needs. We may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities through one or more discrete transactions, or
enter into a strategic alliance arrangement, but can provide no assurances that any such financing or strategic alliance arrangement will
be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Moreover, the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and
could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Raising additional funds through strategic alliance arrangements with third
parties may require significant time to complete and could force us to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue
streams, research programs or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us or our stockholders. Our
actual cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to a number of factors, including any change in the timing of
the commercial launch of DefenCath or the focus and direction of our research and development programs, any acquisition or pursuit of
development of new product candidates, competitive and technical advances, the costs of commercializing any of our product candidates,
and costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and any other intellectual property rights. 

27 

We expect to generate product
sales for DefenCath in the U.S. In the absence of significant revenue, we may continue generating operating cash flow deficits. We will
continue to use cash as we increase other activities relating to the commercialization of DefenCath and pursue business development activities. 

We currently estimate that
as of September 30, 2024, we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to fund operations for at least twelve
months from the issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These estimates are based upon the Company s base case assumptions
for market penetration, average selling price, gross-to-net discounts, research and development expense and commercial infrastructure
cost. Additional financing may be needed to build out our commercial infrastructure and to continue our operations. If we are unable to
raise additional funds when needed, we may be forced to slow or discontinue the commercial launch of DefenCath. We may also be required
to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our anticipated research and development programs. Each of these alternatives would likely
have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Contractual Obligations 

We entered into a seven-year
operating lease agreement in March 2020 for our office space at 300 Connell Drive, Berkeley Heights, New Jersey 07922. The lease agreement,
with a monthly average cost of approximately 17,000, commenced on September 16, 2020. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail
in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Liquidity and Uncertainties, to our consolidated financial
statements included in Item 1, Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
we believe that the following accounting policies require the application of significant judgments and estimates. 

For the nine months period
ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates as identified in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as noted below: 

Litigation contingencies are assessed to determine if an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, and if so, the contingency is disclosed along with an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. If a liability is possible or probable, but no reasonable estimation of loss can be made, we will disclose the nature of the contingency and state that such an estimate cannot be made. 

The assessment of going concern uncertainty in our consolidated financial statements to determine if we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand and working capital, including available loans or lines of credit, if any, to operate for a period of at least one year from the date our condensed consolidated financial statements are issued (the look-forward period ). As part of this assessment, based on conditions that are known and reasonably knowable to us, we consider various scenarios, forecasts, projections, and estimates, and we make certain key assumptions, including the uptake of our product in the inpatient and outpatient settings and commercial contract terms that align with our internal assumptions. Based on this assessment, as necessary or applicable, we make certain assumptions around revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, inventory build and working capital needs to the extent we deem probable those implementations can be achieved within the look-forward period. For additional information, refer to Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

28 

We account for product revenue from the sale of our product, DefenCath, in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). The provisions of ASC 606 require the following steps to determine revenue recognition: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only recognize revenue when we believe that it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of the promised goods or services to a customer. In accordance with our contracts with customers, control of the product is transferred upon the conveyance of title, which occurs when the product is received by a customer. Our customers are located in the United States and consist primarily of wholesale distributors and outpatient service providers. 

We include an estimate
of variable consideration in our transaction price at the time of sale when control of the product transfers to the customer. Variable
consideration includes: 

Distribution
 service fees; 

Prompt
 pay and other discounts; 

Product
 returns; 

Chargebacks; 

Rebates; 

Volume
 incentive rebates. 

We
assess whether or not an estimate of our variable consideration is constrained based on the probability that a significant reversal in
the amount of cumulative revenue may occur in the future when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently
resolved. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may vary from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from
our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect product sales and earnings in the period such variances become known. 

The
specific considerations that we use in estimating certain amounts related to variable considerations are as follows: 

Distribution
services fees We pay distribution service fees primarily to our wholesale distributors. We reserve these fees based on actual
net sales and the contractual fee rates negotiated with the customers in the distribution channel. 

Prompt
pay and other discounts We provide customers with prompt pay discounts. The specific prompt pay terms vary by customer and are
contractually fixed. Prompt pay discounts are expected to be taken by our customers, so an estimate of the discount is recorded at the
time of sale based on the invoice price. 

Product
returns Customers have the right to return the product that is within six months or less of the labeled expiration date
or that is past the expiration date by no more than six months. An estimate for product returns is made based on: (i) data provided to
us from our distributors and (ii) the estimated remaining shelf life of DefenCath previously shipped and currently being shipped to distributors. 

Chargebacks 
Certain covered entities, group purchasing organizations GPO and government entities will be able to purchase the product
at a discounted price. The difference between the GPO, government or covered entity purchase price and the wholesale distributor purchase
price will be charged back to us. We estimate the amount in chargebacks based on the expected number of claims and related cost that
is associated with the revenue being recognized for product that remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period. 

Rebates 
We are subject to negotiated discount obligations to different GPO s, direct purchasers, other commercial organizations or government
programs. The rebate amounts for these programs are determined by statutory requirements or contractual arrangements. Our liability for
these rebates consists of invoices received for claims that have not been paid or for which an invoice has not yet been received, estimates
of claims for the current quarter are based on expected product utilization, and estimated future claims that will be made for product
that has been recognized as revenue, but remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period. 

29 

Volume
Incentive Rebates Volume incentive rebates are provided to certain customers. Rebates are owed based on predetermined volume
levels and payable per the terms in the customer contracts. We estimate and record volume incentive rebates based on anticipated purchase
volume with specific customers based on communications with the customer. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk. 

The
Company is not required to provide the information called for in this item due to its status as a Smaller Reporting Company. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed only to provide reasonable assurance that information to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Changes in
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II 
OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

For
information regarding our legal proceedings, see Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies, included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements,
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated into this item by reference. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

We
have significant customer concentration, with a limited number of customers accounting for a large portion of our revenues. 

We
derive a large portion of our revenues from a few major customers. These customers have no purchase commitments and may cancel, change
or delay purchases with little or no notice or penalty. As a result of these customer concentrations, our revenue could fluctuate materially
and could be materially and disproportionately impacted by purchasing decisions of these customers or any other significant customer.
These customers may decide to purchase less DefenCath from us than management anticipates, may alter purchasing patterns at any time
with limited notice, or may decide not to continue to purchase DefenCath at all, any of which could cause our revenue to decline materially
and materially harm our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to diversify and grow our customer base, we will
continue to be susceptible to risks associated with customer concentration. 

See
Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
