The fair value of this contingent consideration receivable is as of September 30, 2024, of which almost all is classified as Other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 ) ) ) Impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
 Balance as of September 30, 2024 
 In the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to sustained declines in our share price, we determined that it was appropriate to perform an interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. We performed the assessment, consistent with our goodwill impairment testing policy and procedures, by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying value for both of our segment reporting units carrying a goodwill balance. Based on the quantitative assessment performed, we concluded that the estimated fair value of the A G reporting unit continues to be substantially in excess of its carrying value. For the LS H reporting unit, we determined the carrying value exceeded its fair value; consequently, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of in the second quarter of 2024. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded of goodwill associated with a small acquisition within the IP reporting unit. We recorded an impairment to the goodwill because the IP reporting unit s fair value was significantly below its carrying value based on the results of our most recent interim quantitative impairment assessment described above.

 and mature in October 2026. 
 The fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate such agreements, taking into account market interest rates and the remaining time to maturities or using market inputs with mid-market pricing as a practical expedient for bid-ask spread. Changes in fair value are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss AOCL in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with a related offset in derivative asset or liability, and the amounts reclassified out of AOCL are recorded to Interest expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings in the same period during which transactions affect earnings, or upon termination of the arrangements. For additional information on changes recorded to AOCL, see Note 7 - Shareholders' Equity . As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that approximately of pre-tax gain related to interest rate swaps recorded in AOCL will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. 
 Cross-Currency Swaps 
 In July 2023, we entered into a cross-currency swap that matures in 2026 to mitigate foreign currency exposure related to our net investment in various euro-functional-currency consolidated subsidiaries. This swap is designated and qualifies as a net investment hedge. We elected to assess the effectiveness of this net investment hedge based on changes in spot rates and are amortizing the portion of the net investment hedge that was excluded from the assessment of effectiveness over the life of the swap within Interest expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The notional amount of the cross-currency swap associated with euro-denominated subsidiary net investments was as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in fair value are recorded in AOCL (as a foreign currency translation adjustment) in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a related offset in derivative asset or liability. Any gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. For additional information on changes recorded to AOCL, see Note 7 - Shareholders' Equity . 
 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
 We periodically enter into foreign currency contracts, which generally do not exceed days in duration, to help manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate risks. We have not designated these contracts as accounting hedges. We initially recognize these contracts at fair value on the execution date and subsequently remeasure the contracts to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. We assess the fair value of these instruments by considering current and anticipated movements in future interest rates and the relevant currency spot and future rates available in the market. We receive third-party valuation reports to corroborate our determination of fair value. 
 We recognize the associated realized and unrealized gains and losses in Other operating expense (income), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recognized a loss (gain) from the fair value adjustment of ) and , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and ) and , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

All other terms related to the revolving credit facility were substantively unchanged. 
 As of September 30, 2024, letters of credit totaling were collateralized by the revolving credit facility. 
 Term Loan Facility 
 As part of the January 2024 refinancing, we made a prepayment of on the existing term loans due in 2026 and then refinanced the remaining term loans with a new tranche of term loans maturing in 2031. The interest rate margin for the new term loan facility decreased from to basis points per annum in the case of loans bearing interest by reference to term SOFR. The term loans amortize in equal quarterly installments (the first installment was paid on June 28, 2024) equivalent to a rate of per annum, with the balance due at maturity. 
 The carrying value of our variable interest rate debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the interest rate benchmark rates. The fair value of the fixed rate debt is estimated based on market observable data for debt with similar prepayment features. The fair value of our debt was and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is considered Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.

The warrants were subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and represented a liability balance of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, classified within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in fair value was recognized as a fair value adjustment of warrants in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Between January and March 2022, three putative securities class action complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Clarivate and certain of its executives and directors alleging that there were weaknesses in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting and financial reporting procedures that it failed to disclose in violation of federal securities law. The complaints were consolidated into a single proceeding on May 18, 2022. On August 8, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, seeking damages on behalf of a putative class of shareholders who acquired Clarivate securities between July 30, 2020, and February 2, 2022, and/or acquired Clarivate ordinary or preferred shares in connection with offerings on June 10, 2021, or Clarivate ordinary shares in connection with a September 13, 2021, offering. The amended complaint, like the prior complaints, references an error in the accounting treatment of an equity plan included in the Company s 2020 business combination with CPA Global that was disclosed on December 27, 2021, and related restatements issued on February 3, 2022, of certain of the Company s previously issued financial statements. The amended complaint also alleges that the Company and certain of its executives and directors made false or misleading statements relating to the Company s product quality and expected organic revenues and organic growth rate, and that they failed to disclose significant known changes to the Company s business model. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on October 7, 2022. Without deciding the motion, the court entered an order on June 23, 2023, allowing plaintiffs limited leave to amend, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 14, 2023. On August 10, 2023, the court issued an order deeming defendants prior motions and briefs to be directed at the amended complaint and permitting defendants to file supplemental briefs to address the new allegations in the amended complaint. Supplemental briefing on the motions was completed on September 8, 2023. Defendants motions to dismiss the amended complaint are currently pending. 
 In a separate but related litigation, on June 7, 2022, a class action was filed in Pennsylvania state court in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia asserting claims under the Securities Act of 1933, based on substantially similar allegations, with respect to alleged misstatements and omissions in the offering documents for two issuances of Clarivate ordinary shares in June and September 2021. The Company moved to stay this proceeding on August 19, 2022, and filed its preliminary objections to the state court complaint on October 21, 2022. After granting a partial stay on January 4, 2023, the court denied a further stay of the proceedings on April 17, 2023. On April 24, 2024, the court sustained the Company s preliminary objections, but permitted plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint, which plaintiff filed on May 28, 2024. On August 29, 2024, plaintiff filed a second amended complaint, to which the Company filed preliminary objections on September 30, 2024. Clarivate does not believe that the claims alleged in the complaints have merit and will vigorously defend against them. Given the early stage of the proceedings, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, arising from these matters.

 Key Performance Indicators 
 We regularly monitor the following key performance indicators to evaluate our business and trends, measure our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Organic revenue growth, Annualized contract value, Annual renewal rates, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free cash flow are key performance indicators because they are a basis upon which management assesses our performance, and we believe they reflect the underlying trends and indicators of our business by allowing management to focus on the most meaningful indicators of our continuous operational performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free cash flow are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles non-GAAP ). Although we believe these measures may be useful to investors for the same reasons described above, these measures are not a substitute for GAAP financial measures or disclosures. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the corresponding most closely related measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are provided further below. 
 Organic revenue growth 
 We review year-over-year organic revenue growth in our segments as a key measure of our success in addressing customer needs. We also review year-over-year organic revenue growth by transaction type to help us identify and address broad changes in product mix, and by geography to help us identify and address changes and revenue trends by region. We measure organic revenue growth excluding acquisitions, disposals, and foreign currency impacts. We define these components as follows: 
 Organic : Revenue generated from pricing, up-selling, securing new customers, sales of new or enhanced product offerings, and any other revenue change drivers except for changes from acquisitions, disposals, and foreign currency. 
 Acquisitions : Revenue generated from acquired products and services from the date of acquisition to the first anniversary date of that acquisition. 
 Disposals : Revenue generated in the comparative prior year period from product lines, services, and/or businesses divested from the date of the sale in the current period presented or included within a disposal group. 
 Foreign Currency FX : The difference between current revenue at current exchange rates and current revenue at the corresponding prior period exchange rates.

Annualized contract value 
 Annualized contract value ACV ), at a given point in time, represents the annualized value for the next 12 months of subscription-based license agreements with our customers, assuming that all expiring license agreements during that period are renewed at their current price level. The renewal period for our subscriptions generally starts 90 days before the end of the current subscription period. Our calculation of ACV includes the impact of downgrades, upgrades, price increases, and cancellations during the reporting period. 
 We monitor ACV because it represents a leading indicator of the potential subscription revenues that may be generated from our existing customer base over the upcoming 12-month period. Measurement of subscription revenues as a key operating metric is particularly relevant because a majority of our revenues are generated from subscription-based license agreements. Actual subscription revenues that we recognize during any 12-month period are likely to differ from ACV at the beginning of that period, sometimes significantly. This may occur for various reasons, including subsequent changes in annual renewal rates, impacts of price increases (or decreases), cancellations, upgrades and downgrades, and acquisitions and divestitures. We calculate and monitor ACV for each of our segments and use the metric as part of our evaluation of our business and trends. 
 Our ACV was 1,596.4 and 1,579.2 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which corresponds to an increase of 1.1 . The increase in ACV was primarily due to the impact of price increases, partially offset by volume declines. 
 Annual renewal rate 
 Our revenues are primarily subscription based, which leads to high revenue predictability. Our ability to retain existing subscription customers is a key performance indicator that helps explain the evolution of our historical results and is a leading indicator of our revenues and cash flows for the subsequent reporting period. 
 Annual renewal rate is the metric we use to determine renewal levels by existing customers across our segments, and is a leading indicator of renewal trends, which impact the evolution of our ACV and results of operations. We calculate the annual renewal rate for a given period by dividing (a) the annualized dollar value of existing subscription product license agreements that are renewed during that period, including the value of any product downgrades, by (b) the annualized dollar value of existing subscription product license agreements that come up for renewal in that period. Open renewals, which we define as existing subscription product license agreements that come up for renewal but are neither renewed nor canceled by customers during the applicable reporting period, are excluded from both the numerator and denominator of the calculation. We calculate the annual renewal rate to reflect the impact of product downgrades but not the impact of product upgrades upon renewal, because upgrades reflect the purchase of additional products and services. 
 The impact of upgrades, new subscriptions, and product price increases is reflected in ACV, but not in annual renewal rates. Our annual renewal rate was 92 and 92 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA is presented because it is a basis upon which our management assesses our performance, and we believe it is useful for investors to understand the underlying trends of our operations. Adjusted EBITDA represents Net income (loss) before the Provision (benefit) for income taxes, Depreciation and amortization, and Interest expense, net, adjusted to exclude acquisition and/or disposal-related transaction costs, share-based compensation, restructuring expenses, impairments, the impact of certain non-cash fair value adjustments on financial instruments, unrealized foreign currency gains/losses, legal settlements, and other items that are included in Net income (loss) for the period that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by Revenues. 
 Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by any of the adjusted items, or that our projections and estimates will be realized in their entirety or at all. In addition, because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or discretionary cash available to us to fund our cash needs, including investing in the growth of our business and meeting our obligations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to Net income (loss) and Net income (loss) margin, refer to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP measures) below.

Table of Contents 

Free cash flow 
 We use Free cash flow in our operational and financial decision-making and believe it is useful to investors because similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, ratings agencies, and other interested parties to measure the ability of a company to service its debt. Our presentation of Free cash flow should not be construed as a measure of liquidity or discretionary cash available to us to fund our cash needs, including investing in the growth of our business and meeting our obligations. 
 We define Free cash flow as Net cash provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures. For further discussion related to Free cash flow, including a reconciliation to Net cash provided by operating activities, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows below.

 Americas revenues decreased primarily due to lower contributions from A G and LS H. EMEA revenues decreased primarily due to the IP product group divestiture and lower IP contribution. APAC revenues decreased due to a stronger dollar against APAC currencies and the IP product group divestiture, partially offset by A G growth. 
 Cost of revenues 
 Cost of revenues consists of costs related to the production, servicing, and maintenance of our products and are composed primarily of personnel costs, data center services and licensing costs, and costs to acquire or produce content, including royalty fees. 
 The decrease of 4.8 and 4.9 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, was primarily driven by a reduction in share-based compensation expense and reduced product-related royalty fees and content costs. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased by 0.3 and 0.8 , compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of lower share-based compensation expense. 
 Selling, general and administrative costs 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A costs include nearly all business costs not directly attributable to the production, servicing, and maintenance of our products and are composed primarily of personnel costs, third-party professional services fees, facility costs like rent and utilities, technology costs associated with our corporate infrastructure, and transaction expenses associated with acquisitions, divestitures, and capital market activities including advisory, legal, and other professional and consulting costs. 
 The decrease of 1.3 and 2.2 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, was primarily driven by a reduction in share-based compensation expense. As a percentage of revenues, SG A costs were largely unchanged compared to the respective comparative prior year periods. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation expense relates to our fixed assets, including computer hardware, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Amortization expense relates to our definite-lived intangible assets, including customer relationships, technology and content, internally developed computer software, and trade names. 
 The increase of 0.2 and 2.6 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, was primarily driven by increased investment in internally developed software and content assets. 
 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments 
 In the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to sustained declines in our share price, we performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessment by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying value for both of our segment reporting units carrying a goodwill balance. The carrying value of the LS H segment reporting unit exceeded its fair value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of 302.8. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded 13.8 of goodwill associated with a small acquisition within the IP reporting unit. We recorded an impairment to the goodwill because the carrying value of the IP reporting unit was still below its fair value based on the results of our most recent interim quantitative impairment assessment described above. For additional information, see Note 4 - Other Intangible Assets, Net and Goodwill included in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report. 
 In the second quarter of 2023, in connection with the divestiture of a small product group within our IP segment, we recorded an intangible assets impairment charge of 132.2 and a 3.0 goodwill impairment charge associated with the disposal group s allocated portion of the IP segment reporting unit s goodwill balance. For additional information, see Note 2 - Acquisitions and Divestitures included in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report.

Restructuring and other impairments 
 The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 charges were primarily associated with the Segment Optimization Program, which began in the second quarter of 2023 and is expected to continue through the end of 2024. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 charges were primarily associated with the ProQuest Acquisition Integration Program, which was substantively completed in 2023. For further information regarding each of our restructuring initiatives and impairment impacts, see Note 9 - Restructuring and Other Impairments included in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report. 
 Other operating expense (income), net 
 The change of 38.7 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by the net impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, with the largest impacts derived from transactions denominated in GBP. 
 The change of 77.4 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by a (49.4) gain on legal settlement in the comparative prior year period; the net impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, with the largest impacts derived from transactions denominated in GBP; and a 14.8 loss on divestiture in the current year period. For further information, see Note 10 - Other Operating Expense (Income), Net included in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report. 
 Fair value adjustment of warrants 
 The adjustment in fair value, resulting in gains in both the current and comparative prior year periods, was driven primarily by decreases in our share price and the remaining exercise period, both of which reduce the warrant value in the option valuation model. In May 2024, all remaining private placement warrants expired unexercised. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense was largely unchanged compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of (2.3) compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by lower outstanding borrowings on our new term loan facility. 
 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 
 The income tax provision of 15.1 and 15.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was primarily due to the mix of jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and losses were recognized. 
 The income tax provision of 23.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the mix of jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and losses were recognized, partially offset by a 14.2 tax benefit related to the goodwill impairment. The income tax benefit of 83.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by a 70.4 tax benefit recorded on the settlement of an open tax dispute, a 33.0 tax benefit associated with the impairment of intangible assets, and a 17.1 tax benefit relating to the partial release of valuation allowance, partially offset by the mix of taxing jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and losses were recognized. 
 The current quarter effective tax rate may not be indicative of our effective tax rates for future periods. 
 In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD issued model rules for a new global minimum tax framework under its Pillar Two initiative, and various governments around the world have issued, or have announced that they plan to issue, legislation consistent with the OECD model rules. We are within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules. 
 During the third quarter of 2023, the United Kingdom enacted legislation consistent with the OECD model rules, which became effective January 1, 2024. Based on our most recent tax filings, country-by-country reporting, and financial information available, we believe that most of the jurisdictions in which we operate will meet the requirements for transitional safe harbor relief. Therefore, we do not expect the global minimum tax to have a material impact in 2024. However, future legislation or changes in our financial results could materially increase our global minimum tax expense. 
 Dividends on preferred shares 
 Dividends on our MCPS were calculated and accrued at an annual rate of 5.25 of the liquidation preference of 100.00 per share. In June 2024, all outstanding MCPS automatically converted into 55.3 million ordinary shares at a conversion rate of 
 28 

Table of Contents 

3.8462 ordinary shares per MCPS share. All accumulated preferred dividends were paid prior to the conversion, and as a result of the conversion, no further dividends will be accrued or paid. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP measures) 
 The following table presents our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and reconciles these non-GAAP measures to our Net income (loss) and Net income (loss) margin for the same periods: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (loss) (65.6) 12.3 (444.9) (67.3) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 15.1 15.6 23.3 (83.3) Depreciation and amortization 177.2 176.8 541.0 527.5 Interest expense, net 72.2 71.9 213.5 218.5 Transaction related costs 6.1 2.7 13.6 5.1 Share-based compensation expense 15.4 25.4 49.7 97.1 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments 13.8 316.6 135.2 Restructuring and other impairments 4.0 3.7 14.2 25.3 Fair value adjustment of warrants (12.6) (5.2) (14.4) Other (1) 
 26.2 (14.4) 53.3 (24.7) Adjusted EBITDA 264.4 281.4 775.1 819.0 Net income (loss) margin 
 (10.5) 1.9 (23.5) (3.5) Adjusted EBITDA margin 42.5 43.5 40.9 42.1 (1) Primarily reflects the net impact of unrealized foreign currency gains and losses, as well as other items that do not reflect our ongoing operating performance. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amount includes a 14.8 loss on the divestiture discussed in Note 2 - Acquisitions and Divestitures and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the amount includes a 49.4 gain on legal settlement discussed in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We finance our operations primarily through cash generated by operating activities and through borrowing activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 388.5 of cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash of 7.7) and 691.9 of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. 
 Cash Flows 
 We have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities. Our subscription-based revenue model provides a steady and predictable source of revenue and cash flow for us, as we typically receive payments from our customers at the start of the subscription period (usually 12 months) and recognize revenue ratably throughout that period. Our high customer renewal rate, stable margins, and efforts to improve operating efficiencies and working capital management also contribute to our ability to generate solid operating cash flows. 
 The following table discloses our cash flows by activity for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 
 2024 2023 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities 505.3 553.3 (48.0) (9) Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities (258.1) (170.4) (87.7) 51 Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities (230.5) (322.2) 91.7 (28) 
 The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by lower operating results, partially offset by timing of working capital changes. 
 The increase in net cash used for investing activities was due to increased acquisition and divestiture activity, as well as increased capital spending. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

The decrease in net cash used for financing activities was due to lower payments on our term loans and MCPS dividends, partially offset by payments for fees associated with the refinancing of our existing credit facilities in January 2024. During both periods presented, we used 100.0 of cash on hand to repurchase our ordinary shares. 
 Free cash flow (non-GAAP measure) 
 The following table reconciles our non-GAAP Free cash flow measure to Net cash provided by operating activities for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 505.3 553.3 Capital expenditures (206.9) (178.6) Free cash flow 298.4 374.7 
 The decrease in Free cash flow was driven by lower operating results and increased capital expenditures, partially offset by timing of working capital changes. Our capital expenditures in both periods presented consisted primarily of capitalized labor, contract services, and other costs associated with product and content development. 
 Borrowings 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 4,681.9 of outstanding borrowings under our notes and credit facilities. We incurred 213.5 and 218.5 of interest expense associated with our debt obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our contingent liabilities consist primarily of letters of credit and performance bonds and other similar obligations in the ordinary course of business. 
 In January 2024, we refinanced our existing credit facilities to provide improved financial flexibility, including extending our debt maturities and lowering our annual cash interest costs. We amended our 750.0 revolving credit facility by reducing it to a 700.0 facility (with a letter of credit sublimit of 77.0) and extending the maturity date to January 31, 2029. We also made a prepayment of 47.4 on our existing term loans due in 2026 and then refinanced the remaining term loans with a new 2,150 tranche of term loans maturing in 2031. The interest rate margin for the new term loan facility decreased from 300 to 275 basis points per annum in the case of loans bearing interest by reference to term SOFR. The term loans amortize in equal quarterly installments (the first installment was paid on June 28, 2024) equivalent to a rate of 1.00 per annum, with the balance due at maturity. 
 For further discussion related to our outstanding borrowings, see Note 6 - Debt included in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report. 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 In addition to the scheduled future debt repayments that we will need to make, we also have commitments and plans related to our share repurchase program, capital expenditures, and other commitments in the ordinary course of business, primarily for cloud computing services and software license costs. Any amounts for which we are currently liable are reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable or Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 300.0 of availability remaining under our current share repurchase program, which is valid through December 31, 2024. 
 In addition, we are engaged in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have taken what we believe to be adequate reserves related to the litigation and threatened claims. We maintain appropriate insurance policies, which are likely to provide some coverage for these liabilities or other losses that may arise from litigation matters. For additional information about our legal proceedings and claims, see Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies included in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report. 
 We require and will continue to need significant cash resources to, among other things, meet our debt service requirements, fund our working capital requirements, make capital expenditures (including product and content development), and expand our business through acquisitions. Based on our forecasts, we believe that cash flow from operations, available cash on hand, borrowing capacity, and access to capital markets will be adequate to service debt, meet liquidity needs, and fund capital expenditures and other business plans for both the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the number of future acquisitions and the timing and extent of 
 30 

Table of Contents 

spending to support product development efforts. We could be required, or could elect, to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings; however, additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Other than as discussed below, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions from those reported under Part I, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Goodwill 
 We perform goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable. In the second quarter of 2024, we performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment assessment, primarily due to sustained declines in our share price. 
 Consistent with our policy, we estimated the fair value of our segment reporting units using a discounted cash flow DCF model. The most significant change in assumptions compared to our most recent analysis (performed in the fourth quarter of 2023) was the estimated discount rates. We updated the discount rate assumptions to 10.5 and 11.5 for our A G and LS H segment reporting units, respectively, compared to 9.5 and 10 for the same respective segment reporting units in the fourth quarter 2023 analysis. As a result of the quantitative analysis performed, we recorded a 302.8 goodwill impairment charge for the LS H segment reporting unit in the second quarter of 2024. The use of a different set of assumptions and estimates could have resulted in materially different results. A 50 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would have resulted in an incremental impairment charge for the LS H segment reporting unit of approximately 60, while the fair value of the A G segment reporting unit would still be substantially in excess of its carrying value. 
 Future events or changes in circumstances could result in additional changes to our DCF assumptions and estimates that would materially affect the determination of estimated fair value and result in additional impairment charges. 
 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 For recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, will affect our cash flows or the fair value of our holdings of financial instruments. Market risks as of September 30, 2024 have not materially changed from those discussed under Part I, Item 7A. Qu antitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of our controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports to be filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
