 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily because of U.S. taxes on international operations and withholding taxes, partially offset by adjustments to tax reserves due to expiration of statute of limitations, lower taxes on non-U.S. earnings, and global research and development benefits.

million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Unsecured Notes due 2032 (the "2032 Senior Notes"). The 2032 Senior Notes mature on May 31, 2032. The Company incurred million of debt issuance costs, which have been capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis. 
 The 2032 Senior Notes are guaranteed by the Company and each of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries that guarantee obligations under the existing Credit Agreement (as defined below), subject to certain exceptions. The proceeds from the sale of the 2032 Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to repay approximately million of term loan indebtedness, as described below, and to pay related fees and expenses. 
 Term Loans 
 On April 30, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provided for the following long-term senior secured financing (collectively, the "Term Loan Facilities"): 
 2021 Dollar Term Facility: a secured first-lien U.S. Dollar term loan facility for million; 
 2023 Dollar Term Facility : a secured first-lien U.S. Dollar term loan facility for million; and 
 Euro Term Facility : a secured first-lien Euro term loan facility for million. 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made early debt repayments totaling million on our Euro Term Facility and our 2023 Dollar Term Facility. Both term loans were fully repaid as of September 30, 2024. The early repayments resulted in incremental amortization of debt issuance costs of million, included within Interest expense in the Consolidated Interim Statement of Operations. 
 On May 21, 2024, in addition to the above transactions, the Company entered into Amendment No. 4 (the "Fourth Amendment") and Amendment No. 5 (the "Fifth Amendment" and, together with the Fourth Amendment, the "Amendments") to the Credit Agreement (as amended by the Amendments, the "Amended Credit Agreement"). The Fourth Amendment (i) removed the credit spread adjustment with respect to certain US dollar denominated term loan borrowings that are Term Benchmark Loans (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and (ii) reduced the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) on certain US dollar denominated term loans to for Term Benchmark Loans and for ABR Loans (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). 
 The Fifth Amendment increased the amount of revolving loan commitments available to the Company under the Credit Agreement by million ("Incremental Revolving Commitment") to an aggregate amount of million, as discussed below. The Incremental Revolving Commitment has the same terms and is subject to the same conditions applicable to revolving loans generally under the Amended Credit Agreement.

 Revolving Facility and Letters of Credit 
 The Amended Credit Agreement also provides for a senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility providing for multi-currency re volving loans (the Revolving Facility ). The Revolving Facility matures on April 30, 2028 and has a maximum borrowing amount available of million. 
 Under the Revolving Facility, the Company may use up to million for the issuance of letters of credit to its subsidiaries. Letters of credit are available for issuance under the Amended Credit Agreement on terms and conditions customary for financings of this kind, which issuances reduce availability under the Revolving Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had loans outstanding under the Revolving Facility, outstanding letters of credit, and available borrowing capacity of million. 
 Separate from the Revolving Facility, the Company has a bilateral letter of credit facility in the amount of million, which matures on April 30, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million utilized and million of remaining available capacity under such facility.

 The 2032 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of per annum. Interest on the 2032 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 31 and November 30 of each year, commencing on November 30, 2024. 
 The 2021 Dollar Term Facility is subject to an interest rate, at our option, of either (a) an alternate base rate ABR (which shall not be less than or (b) an adjusted SOFR rate SOFR (which shall not be less than ), in each case, plus an applicable margin equal to in the case of SOFR loans and in the case of ABR loans. 
 The Revolving Facility is subject to an interest rate comprised of an applicable benchmark rate as provided under the Credit Agreement (which shall not be less than if such benchmark is the ABR rate and not less than in the case of other applicable benchmark rates) that is selected based on the currency in which borrowings are outstanding thereunder, in each case, plus an applicable margin that may vary based on our leverage ratio.

 Certain Covenants 
 2032 Senior Notes 
 The 2032 Senior Notes contain certain covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt, incur certain liens securing debt, pay certain dividends or make other restricted payments, make certain investments, make certain asset sales, and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, limitations, and qualifications as set forth in the 2032 Senior Notes indenture. Additionally, the indenture contains certain change of control provisions that, under certain conditions, would require the Company to make an offer to repurchase all of the outstanding 2032 Senior Notes at a price equal to of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture also contains customary events of default. 
 Term Loans 
 The Amended Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type. The Revolving Facility also contains a financial covenant requiring the maintenance of a consolidated total leverage ratio of not greater than times as of the end of each fiscal quarter if, on the last day of any such fiscal quarter, the aggregate amount of loans and letters of credit (excluding backstopped or cash collateralized letters of credit and other letters of credit with an aggregate face amount not exceeding million) outstanding under the Revolving Facility exceeds of the aggregate commitments in effect thereunder on such date.

 Fair Value Measurement 
 The foreign currency exchange, interest rate swap and cross-currency swap contracts are valued using market observable inputs. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within Level 2. The assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the cross-currency swap are considered Level 2 inputs, which are based upon market-observable interest rate curves, cross-currency basis curves, credit default swap curves, and foreign exchange rates. 
 The carrying value of Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, Account receivables and Notes and Other receivables contained in the Consolidated Interim Balance Sheet approximates fair value.

 For both our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, we estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit (income) cost by utilizing a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows. This approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, which we refer to as our MD A, should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as the audited annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our 2023 Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this MD A or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" below. 
 The following MD A is intended to help you understand the results of operations and financial condition of Garrett Motion Inc. for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Executive Summary 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we were exposed to challenges within the light vehicle (diesel and gasoline) vertical, including industry softness in Europe and China, competitive pressure faced by global OEMs and short-term headwinds from customer vehicle platform mix. In response, we efficiently adjusted our variable cost structure and proactively implemented sustainable cost actions to drive operational performance. This enabled us to achieve Net income of 52 million and Adjusted EBITDA of 144 million for the quarter. 
 
 We continue to achieve success in our turbocharging, hybrid, and zero-emission technology applications. This quarter, we secured significant industrial contracts in the marine and power generation sectors with our large-size turbochargers. Additionally, we received a letter of intent for our E-Powertrain from a major truck manufacturer in the commercial vehicle industry. Our E-Cooling technology won further pre-development awards from an electric bus manufacturer and we were awarded new series production awards for use of our Fuel Cell technologies for commercial vehicle application. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 52 million and 226 million, respectively, of Common Stock under our share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, we had 124 million of the authorized amount remaining under our share repurchase program. 
 As previously disclosed, on April 3, 2024, we divested our equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture for approximately 58 million, subject to customary debt and working capital adjustments. We received cash consideration on the divestiture date of 46 million, with an additional 7 million still to be received, and recognized a gain of 27 million related to this divestiture. 
 Also as previously disclosed, during the second quarter, we completed an offering of 800 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75 2032 Senior Notes and made early debt repayments totaling 985 million on our Euro Term Facility and 2023 Dollar Term Facility, both of which were fully repaid as of June 30, 2024.

Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Net Sales 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Dollars in millions) Net sales 826 960 2,631 2,941 change compared with prior period (14.0) (10.5) 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales compared to prior year decreased by 134 million or 14 (including a favorable impact of 1 million or 0 due to foreign currency translation primarily driven by higher Euro-to-US dollar). This decrease was primarily driven by lower sales in gasoline and diesel applications due to industry softness in Europe and China, competitive pressure on global OEMs and short-term customer vehicle platform mix impacts. Net sales also decreased due to pricing, net of inflation pass-through, driven by commodity deflation, partially offset by favorable product mix. 
 Gasoline product sales decreased by 81 million or 19 (including a favorable impact of 1 million or 0 due to foreign currency translation), primarily driven by lower demand in China and North America, partially offset by sustained demand in the rest of Asia and South America. 
 Diesel product sales decreased by 49 million or 21 (including a favorable impact of 1 million or 1 due to foreign currency translation), primarily driven by lower passenger vehicle sales in Europe, partially offset by sustained demand for pickup truck in South America. 
 Commercial vehicle sales are consistent year over year (with no foreign currency translation impact), primarily driven by construction and agriculture industry softness, offset by strong demand and favorable product mix in China with natural gas programs applications. 
 Aftermarket sales decreased by 1 million or 1 (including a favorable impact of 1 million or 0 due to foreign currency translation), primarily due to softer sales in North America, partially offset by favorable aftermarket conditions and demand for replacement parts in Asia and Europe. 
 26 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales compared to prior year decreased by 310 million or 11 (including an unfavorable impact of 25 million or 1 due to foreign currency translation primarily driven by lower Chinese Yuan-to-US dollar and Japanese Yen-to-US dollar exchange rates, partially offset by higher Euro-to-US dollar exchange rates) primarily due to demand softness in gasoline, diesel, and commercial vehicle applications across all regions and pricing decreases, net of inflation pass-through, driven by commodity deflation, partially offset by higher demand for replacement parts on aftermarket sales and favorable product mix. 
 Gasoline product sales decreased by 176 million or 14 (including an unfavorable impact of 13 million or 1 due to foreign currency translation), primarily driven by soft demand in China and North America partially offset by program ramp-ups in Europe, Japan, and India. 
 Diesel product sales decreased by 110 million or 15 (including an unfavorable impact of 3 million or 1 due to foreign currency translation), primarily driven by passenger vehicles in Europe, partially offset by sustained demand for pickup trucks in North and South America. 
 Commercial vehicle sales decreased by 30 million or 6 (including an unfavorable impact of 7 million or 1 due to foreign currency translation), primarily driven by construction and agriculture industry softness due to high interest rates and lower crop prices, partially offset by sustained demand in the on-highway industry, especially in China, with natural gas programs applications. 
 Aftermarket sales increased by 8 million or 2 (including an unfavorable impact of 1 million or 1 due to foreign currency translation), primarily due to favorable aftermarket conditions and continued high demand for replacement parts in Europe, China, and North America, partially offset by softer sales in other Asian countries.

 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 6 million compared with the prior year, mainly driven by 5 million of lower professional service and legal fees, 2 million of lower bad debt expense and 2 million of lower IT-related costs. These decreases were partially offset by 2 million of higher repositioning costs and 1 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. 
 SG A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were consistent with the prior year. Year over year variances are primarily related to 5 million of higher stock-based compensation expense and 2 million of higher repositioning costs. These increases were offset by 6 million of lower professional service and legal fees and 2 million of lower IT-related costs. SG A expenses also increased due to 1 million of unfavorable exchange impact.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense decreased by 11 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by 10 million lower of debt issuance cost amortization and 9 million of lower interest expense due to a different notional amount of debt outstanding during the period. In addition, we recorded 4 million of gains on our interest derivatives in the current year, in comparison to 7 million of gains in the prior year. We also recognized 9 million of marked-to-market remeasurement losses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 on our undesignated interest rate swap contracts, in comparison to 5 million of marked-to-market remeasurement losses in the prior year. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased by 26 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by 17 million of higher accelerated debt issuance cost amortization, and 10 million of higher interest expense related to our 2032 Senior Notes partially offset by lower interest expense related to our 2023 Dollar Term Facility. In addition, we recorded 23 million of gains, net of settlements of 18 million, on our interest derivatives in the current year, in comparison to 18 million of gains in the prior year. We also recognized 33 million of marked-to-market remeasurement losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 on our undesignated interest rate swap contracts, in comparison to 12 million of marked-to-market remeasurement losses in the prior year.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had non-operating income of 1 million versus 2 million in the prior year, primarily driven by lower equity income due to the sale of an equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had non-operating income of 7 million versus an expense of 3 million in the prior year, primarily driven by foreign exchange transactional gains, partially offset by 2 million of lower equity income due to the sale of an equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture.

 The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 31.6 and 18.6 , respectively. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 25.4 and 25.1 , respectively. 
 
 The change in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period is primarily related to global mix of earnings, partially offset by adjustments to tax reserves due to expiration of statute of limitations. 
 
 The change in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period is primarily related to global mix of earnings and tax expense related to the sale of an equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture, partially offset by reversal of tax reserves and lower non-deductible transaction costs. 
 
 In January 2019, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD announced further work in continuation of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, focusing on two pillars. Pillar One provides a framework for the reallocation of certain residual profits of multinational enterprises to market jurisdictions where goods or services are used or consumed. Pillar Two consists of two interrelated rules referred to as Global Anti-Base Erosion GloBE Rules, which operate to impose a minimum tax rate of 15 calculated on a jurisdictional basis. On December 20, 2021, the OECD published GloBE model rules and released multiple rounds of commentary on those rules over the subsequent months. More than 135 OECD member countries have agreed to the key parameters of the model rules, which allow those OECD member countries to begin implementing the GloBE rules in a manner consistent with the agreement reached. The rules were adopted by a number of countries, with an effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2023. 
 
 We do not expect that Pillar One will have an impact on our operations or effective tax rate. Based on currently enacted legislation, we do not expect Pillar Two to have a material impact to our 2024 effective tax rate. However, further enactment of legislation by countries in which we do business could have an impact on our 2024 effective tax rate. 
 
 The effective tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to changes in the Company s global mix of earnings, the resolution of income tax audits, changes in tax laws (including updated guidance on U.S. tax reform), deductions related to employee share-based payments, internal restructurings, and pension mark-to-market adjustments.

 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 5 million compared with the prior year, primarily due to 10 million of decreased gross profit and 11 million of higher tax expense. These decreases were partially offset by 11 million of lower interest expense and 6 million of lower SG A expense. 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 27 million compared with the prior year, primarily due to 44 million of decreased gross profit and 26 million of higher interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by a 27 million gain on the sale of an equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture, 10 million of higher non-operating income, and 8 million of lower tax expense.

Non-GAAP Measures 
 It is management s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to supplement the understanding of our business operations and performance, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the most directly comparable GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Additionally, the non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, an analysis of the Company s operating results as reported under GAAP. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 We evaluate performance on the basis of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We define EBITDA as our net income calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, plus the sum of interest expense net of interest income, tax expense and depreciation. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus the sum of stock compensation expense, repositioning costs, foreign exchange (gain) loss on debt net of related hedging gains, discounting costs on factoring, gain on sale of equity investment, acquisition and divestiture expenses, other non-operating income, capital structure transformation expenses, debt refinancing and redemption costs, net reorganization items and loss on extinguishment of debt (if any). Adjusted EBITDA now also adjusts for acquisition and divestiture expenses, and debt refinancing and redemption costs, but no adjustments were made to the prior period as there were no similar adjustments in the prior periods. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important indicators of operating performance and provide useful information for investors because: 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude the effects of income taxes, as well as the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest and depreciation expenses and therefore more closely measure our operational performance; and 
 certain adjustment items, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and have disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects the comparability of our results. 
 In addition, our management may use Adjusted EBITDA in setting performance incentive targets to align performance measurement with operational performance. 
 The following table reconciles Net income under GAAP to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:

 Adjusted EBITDA for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , net income decreased by 5 million versus the prior year as discussed above within Results of Operations for Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 8 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to lower volumes, as discussed above, commodity deflation impact on pricing net of inflation pass-through as well as unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. These decreases were partially offset by strong operational performance through productivity, net of labor inflation, as well as commodity, transportation, and energy deflation, and a favorable product mix. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we saw soft demand for gasoline and diesel, driven by regional industry and customer mix headwinds, partially offset by favorable demand in aftermarket for replacement parts. Net sales also decreased due to pricing, net of inflation pass-through, driven by commodity deflation. 
 The increased productivity from our ability to flex our variable cost structure, while driving sustained fixed cost productivity, was partially offset by year-over-year labor inflation and lower equity income following prior quarter's sale of an equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture. 
 
 R D expenses increased 6 million, reflecting our continued investment in new technologies and increased hiring to accelerate growth in the zero emission technologies. 
 
 Losses in foreign currency from translational, transactional, and hedging effects in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by lower Euro-to-US dollar, Chinese Yuan-to-US dollar and Japanese Yen-to-US dollar exchange rates versus the prior year period, accounted for a 4 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , net income decreased by 27 million versus the prior year as discussed above within Results of Operations for Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 45 million c ompared to the prior year, mainly due to soft demand across all product lines except aftermarket, pricing net of inflation pass-through, and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. These decreases were partially offset by strong operational performance through productivity, net of labor inflation, as well as commodity, transportation, and energy deflation. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we saw demand softness for gasoline, diesel, and commercial vehicle applications, driven by challenging regional dynamics and customer mix headwinds, partially offset by favorable demand in aftermarket for replacement parts. Net sales also decreased due to pricing decreases, net of inflation pass-through, driven by commodity price decreases. 
 The increased productivity from our ability to flex our variable cost structure while driving sustained fixed cost productivity was partially offset by year-over-year labor inflation. 
 R D expenses increased 10 million, reflecting our continued investment in new technologies and increased hiring to accelerate growth in the zero emission technologies. 
 
 Losses in foreign currency from translational, transactional, and hedging effects in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily driven by lower Chinese Yuan-to-US dollar and Japanese Yen-to-US dollar exchange rates and partially offset by higher Euro-to-US dollar exchange rates versus the prior year period, accounted for a 18 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Dollars in millions) Cash and cash equivalents 96 259 Restricted cash 1 1 Revolving Facility - available borrowing capacity 600 570 Revolving Facility - borrowings or letters of credit outstanding Term Loan Facilities - principal outstanding 693 1,696 Senior Notes - principal outstanding 800 Bilateral letter of credit facility - available capacity 3 3 Bilateral letter of credit facility - utilized capacity 12 12 
 33 

On May 21, 2024, our wholly owned subsidiaries, Garrett Motion Holdings Inc. and Garrett LX I S.a.r.l., completed an offering of 800 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2032 Senior Notes. The 2032 Senior Notes mature on May 31, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 7.75 per annum. We incurred 12 million of debt issuance costs, which have been capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis. 
 On May 21, 2024, we also entered into the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Credit Agreement, which (i) removed the credit spread adjustment with respect to certain US dollar denominated term loan borrowings that are Term Benchmark Loans, (ii) reduced the Applicable Rate on certain US dollar denominated term loans to 2.75 for Term Benchmark Loans and 1.75 for ABR Loans, and (iii) increased the maximum borrowings available under the Revolving Facility by 30 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid 500 million on our 2023 Dollar Term Facility, 485 million 450 million) on our Euro Term Facility and 6 million on our 2021 Dollar Term Facility. 
 We employ several means to manage our liquidity, and our sources of financing include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, the 2032 Senior Notes, our Term Loan Facilities, and our Revolving Facility. We expect to continue investing in our facilities as we expand our manufacturing capacity for new product launches and invest in new technologies and strategic growth opportunities, in particular in the electrification of drivetrains. We believe the combination of expected cash flows, the term loan borrowings, the 2032 Senior Notes, and the Revolving Facility being committed until 2028, will provide us with adequate liquidity to support the Company's operations. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On February 13, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a 350 million share repurchase program valid until December 31, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 226 million of Common Stock, with 124 million remaining under the share repurchase program as of that date. The Company may repurchase shares from time to time under the program through various methods, including in open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions, and otherwise. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will depend on a variety of factors. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the repurchase program, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. For more information, see Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds . 
 Cash Flow Summary for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 (Dollars in millions) Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities 277 330 Investing activities 1 (48) Financing activities (439) (366) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and restricted cash (2) (1) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 (163) (85) 
 Cash provided by operating activities decreased by 53 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of 37 million in net income, excluding the effects of non-cash items, as well as 11 million of unfavorable impacts from changes in other assets and liabilities and 5 million of unfavorable impacts from working capital changes. 
 Cash flow from investing activities increased by 49 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus t he prior year, mainly due to 46 million of proceeds from the sale of equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture and a 15 million increase in proceeds on our cross currency swap contracts which have been designated as net investment hedges of our Euro-denominated operations. This was partially offset by 12 million of increased expenditures for property, plant and equipment. 
 Cash used for financing activities was 439 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 366 million in the prior year. During 2024, we made an aggregate of 991 million in debt repayments on our term loan facilities. We also made payments of 226 million for Common Stock repurchases, 7 million for debt issuance costs and 9 million for other financing activities. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of 794 million, net of deferred financing costs, from the issuance of our 2032 Senior Notes. 
 34 

In comparison, cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by payments of 605 million in aggregate to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock related to the Transaction, including conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, and 42 million for dividends declared on our Series A Preferred Stock. We also made payments of 178 million for the repurchase of Common Stock under our share repurchase program and debt repayments of 205 million including a 200 million early debt repayment on the 2023 Dollar Term Facility and quarterly payments for our 2021 Dollar Term Facility. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds of 667 million from the 2023 Dollar Term Facility net of debt financing costs. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not engage in any off-balance sheet financial arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of our Consolidated Interim Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are summarized in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2023 Form 10-K.

The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are subject to a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including: 
 increases in the costs and availability of raw materials, components, energy and transportation and our ability to offset inflation; 
 35 

sales to major customers as well as a network of independent dealers to manage the distribution of our products, and we could be adversely impacted by the loss of any of our such major customers or dealers, changes in their requirements for our products or changes in their financial condition. 
 the negotiating positions of our customers and our ability to negotiate favorable pricing terms; 
 risks associated with changes in the automotive industry and our inability, or a perception that we are unable, to respond appropriately to such changes, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted; 
 risks associated with any program launch difficulties and inaccuracies in estimates of volumes of awarded business; 
 changes in the automotive industry and economic or competitive conditions;

 geopolitical conditions, catastrophic events and pandemics;

 risks of increased scrutiny from customers, investors, regulators and others regarding sustainability/ESG practices, as well as the climate-related risks we may face, each of which could expose us to liabilities, including reputational harm, impact demand for our products, lead to increased costs and have other adverse effects on our business, supply chain and results of operations; 
 risks associated with joint venture partnerships and joint development projects; 
 any failure to protect our intellectual property or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property of others, and our ability to license necessary intellectual property from third parties;

 36 

You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference herein completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, the net fair value of all financial instruments with exposure to currency risk was a 8 million liability. The potential loss or gain in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse or favorable change in quoted currency exchange rates would be 213 million and (187) million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 exchange rates. The model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates; however, currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
 There have been no other material changes to the Company s quantitative and qualitative disclosures about interest rate or commodity price risks as disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks , in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the operation of our businesses, including those pertaining to product liability, product safety, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment, commercial and contractual matters and various other matters. Although the outcome of any such lawsuit, claim or proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be disposed of unfavorably to us, we do not currently believe that such lawsuits, claims or proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We accrue for potential liabilities in a manner consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, we accrue for a liability when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable. 
 For additional information regarding our legal proceedings, see the discussion under Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K.
