 Acquisitions and Dispositions: 
 We did acquire any properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold properties for an aggregate sales price of , excluding closing costs, as presented in the table below.

If these sales are completed, approximately of the proceeds are required to be used to partially redeem our outstanding senior secured notes due 2026. We may not complete the sales of any or all of the properties we currently plan to sell. Also, we may sell some or all of these properties at amounts that are less than currently expected and/or less than the carrying values of such properties and we may incur losses on any such sales as a result. 
 Impairment: 
 We regularly evaluate our assets for indicators of impairment. Impairment indicators may include declining tenant or resident occupancy, weak or declining profitability from the property, decreasing tenant cash flows or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life, and legislative, market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of an asset. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the affected assets by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from those assets. The future cash flows are subjective and are based in part on assumptions regarding hold periods, market rents and terminal capitalization rates. If the

 credit facility that was fully drawn. The weighted average annual interest rate for borrowings under our former credit facility was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In January 2023, we repaid in outstanding borrowings under our former credit facility and the commitments were reduced to . In February 2023, we reduced the commitments from to following our repayment of in outstanding borrowings under our former credit facility. As a result of the February 2023 reduction in commitments, we recorded a loss on modification or early extinguishment of debt of for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 In May 2024, we executed a fixed rate, interest only mortgage loan secured by medical office and life science properties. This mortgage loan matures in June 2034 and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of . 
 In June 2024, we redeemed of our outstanding senior unsecured notes due 2025 using proceeds from the mortgage loan executed in May 2024. As a result of this redemption, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, all of our senior secured notes due 2026 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint, several and senior secured basis, by certain of our subsidiaries that own properties, or the Collateral Guarantors, and on a joint, several and unsecured basis, by all our subsidiaries other than the Collateral Guarantors and certain excluded subsidiaries, and all of our senior notes due 2025 and all of our senior notes due 2031 were fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint, several and unsecured basis, by all of our subsidiaries except certain excluded subsidiaries. The notes and related guarantees (other than our senior secured notes and the guarantees provided by the Collateral Guarantors) are effectively subordinated to all of our and the subsidiary guarantors' secured indebtedness, respectively, to the extent of the value of the applicable collateral, and the notes and related guarantees are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities and any preferred equity of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Our remaining of senior unsecured notes do not have the benefit of any guarantees as of September 30, 2024. We are currently under agreements or letters of intent to sell of the properties securing our senior secured notes due 2026 for an aggregate sales price of , excluding closing costs. If these sales are completed, the proceeds are required to be used to partially redeem our outstanding senior secured notes due 2026. 
 Our senior secured notes due 2026 and the guarantees provided by the Collateral Guarantors are secured by a first priority lien and security interest in each of the collateral properties and of the equity interests in each of the Collateral Guarantors. No cash interest will accrue on these notes prior to maturity. The accreted value of these notes will increase at a rate of per annum compounded semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, such that the accreted value will equal the principal amount at maturity. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized discount accretion of and , respectively, for our senior secured notes due 2026 in interest expense in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). We have a one-time option to extend the maturity date of these notes by , to January 15, 2027, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of an extension fee. If we exercise this option, interest payments will be due semiannually during the extension period at an initial interest rate of with increases of basis points every 90 days these notes remain outstanding. 
 Based on the significant number of unencumbered properties in our senior housing operating portfolio, or SHOP, segment and our demonstrated ability to execute debt financings, we believe we will likely be able to obtain additional debt financing that will allow us to satisfy the outstanding principal amount of our senior unsecured notes due June 2025.

We estimated the fair values of our issuances of senior unsecured notes due 2025, 2028 and 2031 and our issuance of senior secured notes due 2026 using an average of the bid and ask price on Nasdaq on or about September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (Level 2 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy under GAAP). We estimated the fair values of our secured debts by using discounted cash flows analyses and currently prevailing market terms as of the measurement date (Level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy under GAAP).

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our Annual Report. 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are a REIT organized under Maryland law that primarily owns medical office and life science properties, senior living communities and other healthcare related properties throughout the United States. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 368 properties located in 36 states and Washington, D.C., including 25 properties classified as held for sale and three closed senior living communities. At September 30, 2024, the gross book value of our real estate assets at cost plus certain acquisition costs, before depreciation and purchase price allocations and less impairment write downs, was 7.2 billion. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned an equity interest in each of the Seaport JV and the LSMD JV that own medical office and life science properties located in five states with an aggregate of approximately 2.2 million rentable square feet that were 99 leased with an average (by annualized rental income) remaining lease term of 15.2 years. 
 We are closely monitoring the impacts of the current economic and market conditions on all aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, high interest rates, prolonged high inflation, labor market challenges, volatility in the public equity and debt markets, geopolitical risks, economic downturns or a possible recession and changes in real estate utilization. We expect to experience continued variability in labor, insurance and food costs in our SHOP segment. 
 In response to significant and prolonged increases in inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates multiple times since the beginning of 2022. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates in 2024, we cannot be sure that it will continue to do so, or that any future interest rate decreases will be significant, and interest rates may remain at the current high levels or increase. These inflationary pressures in the United States, as well as global geopolitical instability and tensions, have given rise to uncertainty regarding economic downturns or a possible recession and potential disruptions in the financial markets. An economic recession, or continued or intensified disruptions in the financial markets, could adversely affect our financial condition and that of our managers, operators and tenants, could adversely impact the ability or willingness of our managers, operators, tenants or residents to pay amounts owed to us, could impair our ability to effectively deploy our capital or realize our target returns on our investments, may restrict our access to, and would likely increase our cost of, capital, and may cause the values of our properties and of our securities to decline. 
 We are encouraged by positive trends, including increases in rates and occupancy, in our SHOP segment. Additionally, we expect that favorable supply and demand dynamics in the senior living industry will enable our managers to generate better returns at our communities than we experienced in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic. While certain costs, primarily labor, insurance and food costs, have increased, we expect these cost increases to moderate, which will provide our managers the opportunity to increase rates in excess of increases in costs, resulting in improving returns to us. 
 In an effort to optimize performance, our asset management team reviews the results of each of our senior living communities and our operators, taking into account various factors such as performance metric benchmarks, location and other relevant data points. This comprehensive review process ensures that our decisions are data-driven and strategically aligned with our overall objectives. As a result of these reviews, our strategy to drive positive performance includes analyzing non-performing communities for potential disposition or transition to different operators. 
 For further information and risks relating to these economic uncertainties, including changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and their impact on our business and financial condition, see Part I, Item 1, "Business" and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars and square feet in thousands, unless otherwise noted) 
 We operate in, and report financial information for, the following two segments: Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio and SHOP. We aggregate the operating results of our properties in these two reporting segments based on their similar operating and economic characteristics. Our Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio segment primarily consists of medical office properties leased to medical providers and other medical related businesses, as well as life science properties primarily leased to biotech laboratories and other similar tenants. Our SHOP segment consists of managed senior living communities that provide short term and long term residential living and, in some instances, care and other services for residents where we pay fees to managers to operate the communities on our behalf. 
 We also report non-segment operations, which consists of triple net leased senior living communities and wellness centers that are leased to third party operators from which we receive rents, which we do not consider to be sufficiently material to constitute a separate reporting segment, and any other income or expenses that are not attributable to a specific reporting segment. 
 The following table summarizes the results of operations of each of our segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Property operating expenses. Property operating expenses consist of real estate taxes, utility expenses, insurance, management fees, salaries and benefit costs of property level personnel, repairs and maintenance expense, cleaning expense and other direct costs of operating these properties. The decrease in property operating expenses at our comparable properties is primarily due to a decrease in real estate taxes due to refunds realized and a reduction in assessed values as a result of successful appeals during the 2024 period as well as decreases in repairs and maintenance and utility expenses, partially offset by increases in other direct costs. Property operating expenses decreased at our non-comparable properties primarily due to dispositions since July 1, 2023.

 (2) Average monthly rate reflects the average monthly residents fees and services per occupied unit for the period presented. The average monthly rate is calculated based on the actual number of days during the period. 
 Residents fees and services. Residents fees and services are the revenues earned at our managed senior living communities. We recognize these revenues as services are provided and related fees are accrued. Residents fees and services increased at our comparable properties primarily due to increases in occupancy and average monthly rate at our communities as shown in the table above. The activity for our non-comparable properties primarily reflects the 13 communities transitioned to an existing third party manager during the 2024 period. 
 Property operating expenses. Property operating expenses consist of real estate taxes, utility expenses, insurance, wages and benefit costs of community level personnel, repairs and maintenance expense, management fees, cleaning expense and other direct costs of operating these communities. Property operating expenses increased at our comparable properties primarily due to increases in labor costs, repairs and maintenance, dietary expenses and other direct costs, partially offset by reduced contract labor, real estate taxes and insurance costs due to a reduction in premiums. The activity for our non-comparable properties primarily reflects the 13 communities transitioned to an existing third party manager during the 2024 period.

 (2) Consists of properties that we have owned and which have been reported in the same segment and leased to the same operator continuously since July 1, 2023; excludes properties classified as held for sale, if any. 
 (3) All tenant operating data presented are based upon the operating results provided by our tenants for the most recent prior period for which tenant operating results are available to us. Rent coverage is calculated using the annualized operating cash flows from our triple net lease tenants' operations of our properties, before subordinated charges, if any, divided by annualized rental income. We have not independently verified tenant operating data. Excludes data for historical periods prior to our ownership of certain properties, as well as data for properties sold, closed or classified as held for sale, if any, or for which there was a transfer of operations during the periods presented. 
 Rental income. Rental income increased at our comparable properties primarily due to a new lease at one of our wellness centers. The activity for our non-comparable properties primarily reflects the 18 triple net leased senior living communities classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. 
 Property operating expenses. Property operating expenses consist of real estate taxes, insurance and other expenses that are not paid directly by our tenants. The decrease in property operating expenses for our comparable properties primarily reflects real estate taxes and other expenses we paid during the 2023 period on behalf of a tenant previously in default under leases for six of our wellness centers. We also continue to pay real estate taxes and other expenses for one wellness center until the lease commences, which we expect to occur during the first quarter of 2025. 
 Net operating income. The change in NOI reflects the net changes in rental income and property operating expenses described above. 
 Consolidated : 
 Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the purchase of capital improvements at certain of our properties, partially offset by certain depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated and dispositions since July 1, 2023. 
 General and administrative expense . General and administrative expense consists of fees paid to RMR under our business management agreement, legal and accounting fees, fees and expenses of our Trustees, equity compensation expense and other costs relating to our status as a publicly traded company. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to 6,934 of estimated business management incentive fees that we recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of our total shareholder return exceeding the returns for the MSCI U.S. REIT/Health Care REIT Index over the applicable measurement period and an increase in our business management fees of 622, as a result of an increase in average share price and weighted average debt, partially offset by a decrease in legal and other professional fees. 
 28 

Acquisition and certain other transaction related costs. Acquisition and certain other transaction related costs primarily represent costs incurred with acquisitions and non-recurring transactions that we expensed under GAAP. We incurred transition costs, including termination and other fees, during the 2024 period as a result of our transition of 13 communities to an existing third party manager. For more information about such transition of communities, see Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Impairment of assets. For information about our asset impairment charges, see Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of our Annual Report. 
 Gain on sale of properties. For information regarding gain on sale of properties, see Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Interest and other income. The decrease in interest and other income is primarily due to lower average invested cash balances during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of 940,534 of our senior secured notes due 2026 in December 2023, resulting in discount accretion of 22,034 during the 2024 period. Additionally, we executed a 120,000 mortgage loan in May 2024 at a fixed interest rate of 6.864 per annum. The increase was partially offset by the repayment and termination of our former credit facility and the redemption of 250,000 of our senior notes that were scheduled to mature in May 2024. The net proceeds from our 940,534 senior secured notes due 2026 were used to make these repayments aggregating 700,000 in December 2023. Additionally, in June 2024, we redeemed 60,000 of our outstanding 9.75 senior unsecured notes due 2025 using proceeds from the 120,000 mortgage loan executed in May 2024. 
 Income tax expense . Income tax expense is the result of operating income we earned in certain jurisdictions where we are subject to state income taxes. 
 Equity in net earnings (losses) of investees. Equity in net earnings (losses) of investees is the change in the fair value of our investments in our joint ventures and also represents our proportionate share of the earnings of our equity method investment in AlerisLife. For further information regarding our investment in AlerisLife, see Notes 3 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

We have not independently verified tenant operating data. 
 Rental income. Rental income decreased at our comparable properties primarily due to a cash settlement and higher cash rents received during the 2023 period from a tenant previously in default under leases for six of our wellness centers. In January 2023, we agreed to amend the lease for three of these wellness centers and repossess the remaining three wellness centers.

 Gains on equity securities, net. Gains and losses on equity securities, net, represent the net unrealized losses to adjust our investment in AlerisLife to its fair value during 2023. For further information regarding our investment in AlerisLife, see Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Interest and other income. The decrease in interest and other income is primarily due to lower average invested cash balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 1,581 of funds we received from certain programs under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the American Rescue Plan Act and various state programs during the 2023 period. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of 940,534 of our senior secured notes due 2026 in December 2023, resulting in discount accretion of 64,133 during the 2024 period. Additionally, we executed a 120,000 mortgage loan in May 2024 at a fixed interest rate of 6.864 per annum. The increase was partially offset by the repayment and termination of our former credit facility and the redemption of 250,000 of our senior notes that were scheduled to mature in May 2024. The net proceeds from our 940,534 senior secured notes due 2026 were used to make these repayments in December 2023 aggregating 700,000.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt in connection with the redemption of 60,000 of our outstanding 9.75 senior unsecured notes due 2025 using proceeds from the 120,000 mortgage loan executed in May 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a loss on modification or early extinguishment of debt in connection with an amendment to our then credit agreement. 
 Income tax expense . Income tax expense is the result of operating income we earned in certain jurisdictions where we are subject to state income taxes. 
 Equity in net (losses) earnings of investees. Equity in net (losses) earnings of investees is the change in the fair value of our investments in our joint ventures and also represents our proportionate share of the earnings of our equity method investment in AlerisLife.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 
 We present certain "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including funds from operations, or FFO, normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO, and NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of our operating performance or as measures of our liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). We consider these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). We believe these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization, they may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both investors and management to understand the operations of our properties. 
 Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations 
 We calculate FFO and Normalized FFO as shown below. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of properties, equity in net earnings or losses of investees, loss on impairment of real estate assets, gains or losses on equity securities, net, if any, and including adjustments to reflect our proportionate share of FFO of our equity method investees, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. In calculating Normalized FFO, we adjust for the items shown below, including similar adjustments for our unconsolidated joint ventures, if any, and include business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as an expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of our core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in the agreements governing our debt, the availability to us of debt and equity capital, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance, and our expected needs for and availability of cash to pay our obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do. 
 Our calculations of FFO and Normalized FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and reconciliations of net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements, to FFO and Normalized FFO appear in the following table. This table also provides a comparison of distributions to shareholders, FFO and Normalized FFO and net income (loss) per share for these periods.

 (1) Incentive fees under our business management agreement are payable after the end of each calendar year, are calculated based on common share total return, as defined, and are included in general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). In calculating net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP, we recognize estimated business management incentive fee expense, if any, in the first, second and third quarters. Although we recognize this expense, if any, in the first, second and third quarters for purposes of calculating net income (loss), we do not include these amounts in the calculation of Normalized FFO until the fourth quarter, when the amount of the business management incentive fee expense for the calendar year, if any, is determined. 
 Property Net Operating Income (NOI) 
 We calculate NOI as shown below. The calculation of NOI excludes certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to our property level results of operations. We define NOI as income from our real estate less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that we record as depreciation and amortization. We use NOI to evaluate individual and company-wide property level performance. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI differently than we do.

The calculation of NOI by reportable segment is included above in this Item 2. The following table includes the reconciliation of net loss to NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our principal sources of cash to meet operating and capital expenses, pay our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders are the operating cash flows we generate as rental income from our leased properties, residents fees and services revenues from our managed communities and proceeds from the disposition of certain properties. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenses, pay our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders for at least the next 12 months. Our future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon: 
 our ability to receive rents from our tenants; 
 our ability to maintain or increase the occupancy of, and the rates at, our properties; 
 our and our managers' abilities to control operating expenses and capital expenses at our properties, including increased operating expenses that we may incur in response to wage and commodity price inflation, limited labor availability and increased insurance costs; and 
 our managers' abilities to maintain or increase our returns from our managed senior living communities. 
 Although the senior living industry has been adversely affected by a slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as economic and market conditions, there have been signs of recovery. While we are encouraged by positive trends, including increases in rates and occupancy in our SHOP segment and favorable supply and demand dynamics in the senior living industry, generally, we cannot be sure that these trends will continue to benefit us and any benefits we do realize may be uneven. While we continue to experience variability in labor, insurance and food costs in our SHOP segment, we expect increases in these costs to moderate and we continue to work with our senior living operators to manage these costs and to increase rates and occupancy at our communities, which we believe will enable our managers to generate better returns to us. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 We also continue to invest capital in our SHOP segment in order to capitalize on these positive trends and increase the probability of higher cash flows to us. 
 On December 21, 2023, we completed a private offering of 940.5 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior secured notes due January 2026, with a one-year extension option. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately 730.4 million after deducting initial purchaser discounts and estimated offering costs. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay in full the 450.0 million outstanding under our then secured credit facility and to redeem 250.0 million of our senior notes that were scheduled to mature in May 2024. 
 Until its repayment in full and termination on December 21, 2023, we had a 450.0 million credit facility that was fully drawn. 
 On May 30, 2024, we executed a 120.0 million fixed rate, interest only mortgage loan secured by eight medical office and life science properties. This mortgage loan matures in June 2034 and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of 6.864 . The net proceeds from this mortgage loan were approximately 117.1 million after deducting estimated closing costs, and we used 60.0 million of the net proceeds to partially redeem our then outstanding 500.0 million senior notes due 2025. As a result of these transactions, we have no significant debt maturities until June 2025 when 440.0 million of our senior notes will become due, and as of September 30, 2024, we had 256.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, our ratio of consolidated income available for debt service to debt service is above the 1.5x incurrence requirement under our senior notes, on a pro forma basis. We are able to refinance existing or maturing debt and issue new debt as long as this ratio is at or above 1.5x on a pro forma basis at the time of such refinancing or issuance. 
 Based on the significant number of unencumbered properties in our SHOP segment and our demonstrated ability to execute debt financings, we believe we will likely be able to obtain additional debt financing that will allow us to satisfy the 440.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9.75 senior unsecured notes due June 2025. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold four properties for an aggregate sales price of 29.1 million, excluding closing costs. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we sold one of these properties for a sales price of 6.6 million, excluding closing costs. As of November 4, 2024, we had 28 properties under agreements or letters of intent to sell for an aggregate sales price of 348.1 million, excluding closing costs. If these sales are completed, approximately 302.1 million of the proceeds are required to be used to partially redeem our outstanding senior secured notes due 2026. We may not complete the sales of any or all of the properties we currently plan to sell. Also, we may sell some or all of these properties at amounts that are less than currently expected and/or less than the carrying values of such properties and we may incur losses on any such sales as a result. For further information regarding our dispositions, see Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows for the periods presented, as reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (dollars in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 246,961 688,302 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 94,028 17,692 Investing activities (120,882) (150,846) Financing activities 41,293 (276,043) Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period 261,400 279,105 
 Our Operating Liquidity and Resources 
 We generally receive minimum rents from tenants at our medical office and life science properties, triple net leased senior living communities and wellness centers monthly, we receive residents fees and services revenues, net of expenses, from our managed senior living communities monthly and we receive percentage rents from tenants at certain of our senior living communities monthly, quarterly or annually. 
 The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period was primarily due to increased NOI as a result of increased rates and occupancy at the senior living communities in our SHOP segment. Additionally, cash interest payments decreased during the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period primarily 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 due to the repayment and termination of our former credit facility and the redemption of 250.0 million of our senior notes in December 2023. 
 Our Investing Liquidity and Resources 
 The decrease in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a decrease in real estate improvements and an increase in proceeds from the sale of properties during the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. The decrease was partially offset by our purchase on February 16, 2024 of approximately 34.0 of the then outstanding AlerisLife common shares from ABP Trust at the tender offer price of 1.31 per share for a total purchase price, including transaction related costs, of 15.5 million. During the 2023 period, we tendered all of our AlerisLife common shares at 1.31 per share. 
 The following is a summary of capital expenditures, development, redevelopment and other activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

 (1) Lease related costs generally include capital expenditures to improve tenants' space or amounts paid directly to tenants to improve their space and other leasing related costs, such as brokerage commissions and tenant inducements. 
 (2) Building improvements generally include capital expenditures to replace obsolete building components that extend the useful life of existing assets or other improvements to increase the marketability of the property. 
 (3) Development, redevelopment and other activities generally include capital expenditures that reposition a property or result in new sources of revenue. 
 We generally plan to continue investing capital in our properties, including redevelopment projects, to better position these properties in their respective markets in order to increase our returns in future years. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had estimated unspent leasing related obligations at our triple net leased wellness centers and our medical office and life science properties of approximately 31.4 million, of which we expect to spend approximately 20.3 million during the next 12 months. We expect to fund these obligations using operating cash flows we generate as rental income from our leased properties, residents fees and services revenues from our managed communities, cash on hand, proceeds from the disposition of certain properties and future financing activities. 
 We are currently in the process of redeveloping certain properties, primarily our managed senior living communities, which projects are expected to be completed at various times between 2024 and 2025. We continue to assess opportunities to redevelop other properties in our Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio and SHOP segment. These redevelopment projects may require significant capital expenditures and time to complete, and we may defer certain redevelopment projects to preserve 
 38

 liquidity. Due to labor availability constraints and wage and commodity price inflation, the capital investments we plan to make may be delayed or cost more than we expect. 
 Our Financing Liquidity and Resources 
 The change in cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash used in financing activities for the prior period was primarily due to our execution of a 120.0 million mortgage loan during the 2024 period and 250.0 million in repayments of borrowings under our former credit facility during the 2023 period, which was partially offset by the redemption of 60.0 million of our senior notes during the 2024 period. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 256.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. We typically use cash balances, net proceeds from offerings of securities, debt issuances or dispositions of assets and cash flows from our operations to fund our operations, debt repayments, distributions, acquisitions, investments, capital expenditures and other general business purposes. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid quarterly cash distributions to our shareholders totaling approximately 7.2 million using existing cash balances. On October 16, 2024, we declared a quarterly distribution payable to common shareholders of record on October 28, 2024 in the amount of 0.01 per share, or approximately 2.4 million. We expect to pay this distribution on or about November 14, 2024 using cash on hand. For further information regarding the distribution we paid during 2024, see Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We believe we may have access to certain types of financings, including debt or equity offerings, to fund our operations and repay our debts and other obligations as they become due. Our ability to complete, and the costs associated with, future debt or equity transactions depends primarily upon credit market conditions and our then creditworthiness and our ability to be in compliance with our debt covenants. We have no control over market conditions. Our credit and debt ratings depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans, including our ability to maintain our earnings, to stagger our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably anticipated adverse changes. Similarly, our ability to raise equity capital in the future will depend primarily upon equity capital market conditions and our ability to conduct our business to maintain and grow our operating cash flows. We intend to conduct our business activities in a manner which will afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities, but we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully carry out that intention. A protracted negative impact on the economy or the industries in which our properties and businesses operate resulting from wage and commodity price inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical risks or other economic, market or industry conditions, including the delayed recovery of the senior housing industry, economic downturns and a possible recession, may have various negative consequences including a decline in financing availability and increased costs for financing. Further, those conditions could also disrupt capital markets and limit our access to financing from public sources, particularly if the global financial markets experience significant disruptions. 
 Our 940.5 million in outstanding senior secured notes due 2026 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint, several and senior secured basis, by the Collateral Guarantors, and on a joint, several and unsecured basis, by all our subsidiaries other than the Collateral Guarantors and certain excluded subsidiaries. These notes and the guarantees provided by the Collateral Guarantors are secured by a first priority lien and security interest in each of the collateral properties and 100 of the equity interests in each of the Collateral Guarantors. No cash interest will accrue on these notes prior to maturity. The accreted value of these notes will increase at a rate of 11.25 per annum compounded semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. We are currently under agreements or letters of intent to sell 22 of the properties securing our senior secured notes due 2026 for an aggregate sales price of 302.1 million, excluding closing costs. If these sales are completed, the proceeds are required to be used to partially redeem our outstanding senior secured notes due 2026. 
 In January 2023, we repaid 113.6 million in outstanding borrowings under our former credit facility and the commitments were reduced to 586.4 million. In February 2023, we reduced the commitments from 586.4 million to 450.0 million following our repayment of 136.4 million in outstanding borrowings under our former credit facility. Until its repayment in full and termination on December 21, 2023, we had a 450.0 million credit facility that was fully drawn. At December 21, 2023, our former credit facility required interest to be paid on borrowings at an annual rate of 8.4 , plus a facility fee of 0.3 million per quarter. 
 In May 2024, we executed a 120.0 million fixed rate, interest only mortgage loan secured by eight medical office and life science properties. This mortgage loan matures in June 2034 and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of 6.864 . 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 In June 2024, we redeemed 60.0 million of our outstanding 9.75 senior unsecured notes due 2025 using proceeds from the 120.0 million mortgage loan executed in May 2024. 
 In January 2024, Moody's Investors Service, or Moody's, upgraded our 9.75 senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375 senior notes due 2031 ratings from Ca to Caa3 and our senior unsecured debt rating from C to Ca, and Moody's also assigned a Caa2 rating to our senior secured notes due 2026. 
 In January 2024, Standard Poor's Rating Services, or Standard Poor's, upgraded our 9.75 senior notes due 2025 rating from CCC+ to B, our 4.375 senior notes due 2031 rating from CCC+ to B and our senior unsecured debt rating from CCC- to CCC, and Standard Poor's also assigned a B rating to our senior secured notes due 2026. 
 For further information regarding our outstanding debt, see Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Debt Covenants 
 Our principal debt obligations at September 30, 2024 were: (1) 2.0 billion outstanding principal amount of senior unsecured notes; (2) 940.5 million outstanding principal amount of senior secured notes; and (3) 127.9 million aggregate principal amount of mortgage notes (excluding discounts, premiums and net debt issuance costs) secured by nine properties. For further information regarding our indebtedness, see Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our senior notes are governed by our senior notes indentures and their supplements. Our senior notes indentures and their supplements provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default. Our senior notes indentures and their supplements also contain covenants that restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties, in excess of calculated amounts and require us to maintain various financial ratios. As of September 30, 2024, we believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our senior notes indentures and their supplements and our other debt obligations. Although we continue to take steps to enhance our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity, as noted elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a protracted negative impact on the economy or the industries in which our properties and businesses operate resulting from wage or commodity price inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical risks or other economic, market or industry conditions, including the delayed recovery of the senior housing industry, economic downturns or a possible recession, may cause increased pressure on our ability to satisfy financial and other covenants. If our operating results and financial condition are significantly negatively impacted by economic conditions or otherwise, we may fail to satisfy our debt covenants and conditions. 
 Our senior notes indentures and their supplements do not contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. See " Our Financing Liquidity and Resources" above for information regarding recent changes to our issuer credit rating and senior debt ratings. 
 Our senior unsecured notes indentures and their supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of more than 20.0 million 50.0 million or more in the case of our senior notes indentures and supplements entered in February 2016, February 2018, June 2020, February 2021 and December 2023). 
 The loan agreements governing the aggregate 620.0 million secured debt financing related to the Seaport JV contain customary covenants and provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts due thereunder upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default. We no longer include this 620.0 million of secured debt financing in our condensed consolidated balance sheet following the deconsolidation of the net assets of this joint venture; however, we continue to provide certain guaranties on this debt. The debt secured by the properties included in the LSMD JV in which we own a 20 equity interest is guaranteed by this joint venture and is non-recourse to us. 
 Supplemental Guarantor Information 
 On May 28, 2020, we issued 1.0 billion of our 9.75 senior notes due 2025. We subsequently redeemed 500.0 million and 60.0 million of this debt in June 2022 and June 2024, respectively, with 440.0 million remaining outstanding. On February 3, 2021, we issued 500.0 million of our 4.375 senior notes due 2031. As of September 30, 2024, all 440.0 million of our 9.75 senior notes due 2025 and all 500.0 million of our 4.375 senior notes due 2031 were fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint, several and unsecured basis, by all of our subsidiaries except certain excluded subsidiaries. The notes and related guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of our and the subsidiary guarantors' secured indebtedness, respectively, to the extent of the value of the applicable collateral, and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 other liabilities and any preferred equity of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Our remaining 1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes do not have the benefit of any guarantees. 
 A subsidiary guarantor's guarantee of our 9.75 senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375 senior notes due 2031, as applicable, and all other obligations of such subsidiary guarantor under the indenture governing the notes will automatically terminate and such subsidiary guarantor will automatically be released from all of its obligations under such subsidiary guarantee and the indenture under certain circumstances, including on or after the date (a) the notes have an investment grade rating from two rating agencies and one of such investment grade ratings is a mid-BBB investment grade rating and (b) no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our 9.75 senior notes due 2025 or our 4.375 senior notes due 2031 or the respective guarantees, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payments. The rights of holders of our 9.75 senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375 senior notes due 2031, as applicable, to benefit from any of the assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries are subject to the prior satisfaction of claims of those subsidiaries' creditors and any preferred equity holders. As a result, our 9.75 senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375 senior notes due 2031 and the respective guarantees are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee our 9.75 senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375 senior notes due 2031, including guarantees of other indebtedness of ours, payment obligations under lease agreements, trade payables and preferred equity.

For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, see Notes 9, 10 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report, our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and our other filings with the SEC. In addition, see the section captioned Risk Factors of our Annual Report for a description of risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships. We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including businesses to which RMR or its subsidiaries provide management services. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in our condensed consolidated 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 financial statements include purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets and impairments of real estate and intangible assets. 
 A discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included in our Annual Report. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates since the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Impact of Government Reimbursement 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, substantially all of our NOI was generated from properties where a majority of the revenues are derived from our tenants' and residents' private resources, and a small amount of our NOI was generated from properties where a majority of the revenues are derived from Medicare and Medicaid payments. Nonetheless, we own, and our tenants, managers and operators operate, facilities in many states that participate in federal and state healthcare payment programs, including the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare payment programs. Also, some of our medical office and life science property tenants participate in federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs and other government healthcare payment programs. 
 For more information regarding the government healthcare funding and regulation of our business, please see the section captioned Business Government Regulation and Reimbursement in our Annual Report and the section captioned Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Impact of Government Reimbursement in our Annual Report. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives. Other than as described below, we do not currently foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future. 
 We may in the future enter into hedge arrangements or derivative contracts from time to time to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 Fixed Rate Debt 
 In May 2024, we executed a 120.0 million fixed rate, interest only mortgage loan secured by eight medical office and life science properties. This mortgage loan matures in June 2034 and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of 6.864 . Interest payments are due monthly and no principal payment is due until maturity. We used 60.0 million of the net proceeds to partially redeem our then outstanding 500.0 million senior notes due 2025. 
 Other than the transaction described above, there have been no material changes to market interest rate risks associated with our fixed rate debt during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a discussion of market interest rate risks associated with our fixed rate debt, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" included in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report. 
 Floating Rate Debt 
 At September 30, 2024, we did not have any floating rate debt obligations. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 The continuing impact of changing market practices, including those that arose or intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, or delayed returns to prior market practices on us and our managers and other operators and tenants, such as reduced demand for leased medical office, life science and other space of ours and residencies at senior living communities, increased operating costs and labor availability constraints, 
 The financial strength of our managers and other operators and tenants, 
 Whether the aging U.S. population and increasing life spans of seniors will increase the demand for senior living communities and other medical and healthcare related properties and healthcare services, 
 Whether our tenants will renew or extend their leases or whether we will obtain replacement tenants on terms as favorable to us as our prior leases, 
 The likelihood that our tenants and residents will pay rent or be negatively impacted by continuing unfavorable market and commercial real estate industry conditions, 
 Our managers' abilities to increase or maintain rates charged to residents of our senior living communities and manage operating costs for those communities, 
 Our ability to increase or maintain occupancy at our properties on terms desirable to us, 
 Our ability to increase rents when our leases expire or renew, 
 Costs we incur and concessions we grant to lease our properties, 
 Risk and uncertainties regarding the costs and timing of development, redevelopment and repositioning activities, including as a result of prolonged high inflation, cost overruns, supply chain challenges, labor shortages, construction delays or inability to obtain necessary permits or volatility in the commercial real estate markets,
