 million that are on nonaccrual are individually assessed, and if necessary, a specific allocation of the allowance for credit losses is provided. If management determines that foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses for collateral dependent loans are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for estimated selling costs as appropriate. A loan is considered collateral dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the loan is expected to be repaid substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. The collateral for individually assessed CRE non-owner occupied loans consists mainly of office properties associated with customers. A summary of individually assessed business loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 follows: CRE non-owner occupied Total Loans without allowance allocation: CRE owner occupied CRE non-owner occupied Commercial industrial and other business loans Total The average carrying balance of individually assessed loans was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average carrying balance of individually assessed loans was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. interest income was recognized on individually assessed loans for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Occasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, payment delay, or interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. In some cases, the Company provides multiple types of modifications on one loan. Typically, one type of modification, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another modification, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. Upon the Company s determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is charged off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. The estimate of allowance for credit losses includes historical losses from loans that were modified due to borrower financial difficulty, therefore a charge to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification.

The unrealized gain on mortgage loans held for sale was recognized in mortgage banking revenues in the consolidated statements of income and is immaterial. Commitments to originate real estate loans for sale The Company enters into various commitments to originate residential real estate loans for sale. Such commitments are considered to be derivative financial instruments and, therefore, are carried at estimated fair value in the other asset or other liability section of the consolidated statements of condition. The estimated fair value of these commitments is determined using quoted secondary market prices obtained from certain government-sponsored entities. Additionally, accounting guidance requires the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan to be included in the fair value measurement of the derivative. The expected net future cash flows are based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated net servicing income. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income. Such assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing loans, appropriate discount rate and prepayment speeds. The determination of expected net cash flows is considered a significant unobservable input contributing to the Level 3 classification of commitments to originate real estate loans for sale. Forward sales commitments The Company enters into forward sales commitments to sell certain residential real estate loans. Such commitments are considered to be derivative financial instruments and, therefore, are carried at estimated fair value in the other asset or other liability section of the consolidated statements of condition. The fair value of these forward sales commitments is primarily measured by obtaining pricing from certain government-sponsored entities and reflects the underlying price the entity would pay the Company for an immediate sale on these mortgages. As such, these instruments are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Interest rate swaps The interest rate swaps are reported at their fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs from a third-party advisor. The fair value measurement of the interest rate swap is determined by netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on the expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interest rate curves.

 Other real estate owned Mortgage servicing rights Contingent consideration ) ) ) ) Total ) ) Loans are generally not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Periodically, the Company records nonrecurring adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value measurements for partial charge-offs of the uncollectible portions of those loans. Nonrecurring adjustments also include certain impairment amounts for collateral-dependent loans calculated when establishing the allowance for credit losses. Such amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and, as a result, the carrying value of the loan less the calculated valuation amount does not necessarily represent the fair value of the loan. Real estate collateral is typically valued using independent appraisals or other indications of value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions generally observable in the marketplace, adjusted for non-observable inputs. Thus, the resulting nonrecurring fair value measurements are generally classified as Level 3. Estimates of fair value used for other collateral supporting commercial loans generally are based on assumptions not observable in the marketplace and, therefore, such valuations classify as Level 3. Other real estate owned OREO is valued at the time the loan is foreclosed upon and the asset is transferred to OREO. The value is based primarily on third-party appraisals, less estimated costs to sell. The appraisals are sometimes further discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of valuation, and/or management s expertise and knowledge of the customer and customer s business. Such discounts are significant, ranging from to at September 30, 2024 and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. OREO is reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly, based on the same factors identified above. The Company recovers the carrying value of OREO through the sale of the property. The ability to affect future sales prices is subject to market conditions and factors beyond the Company s control and may impact the estimated fair value of a property. Originated mortgage servicing rights are recorded at their fair value at the time of sale of the underlying loan, and are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period of net servicing income. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights is based on a valuation model incorporating inputs that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income. Such inputs include estimates of the cost of servicing loans, appropriate discount rate and prepayment speeds and are considered to be unobservable and contribute to the Level 3 classification of mortgage servicing rights. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records impairment charges, on a nonrecurring basis, when the carrying value of a stratum exceeds its estimated fair value. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance. Subsequent increases in the estimated fair value of a stratum are recorded by reducing the valuation allowance up to an amount that results in the stratum being carried at its remaining amortized cost. There was a valuation allowance of approximately million at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company recognized a million impairment recovery resulting in no valuation allowance at September 30, 2024. The Company has recorded contingent consideration liabilities that arise from acquisition activity. The contingent consideration is recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. The valuation of contingent consideration is calculated using an income approach method, which provides an estimation of the fair value of an asset or liability based on future cash flows over a discrete projection period, discounted to present value using an appropriate rate of return. The assumptions used in the valuation calculation are based on significant unobservable inputs, therefore such valuations classify as Level 3. The contingent consideration related to the Fringe Benefits Design of Minnesota, Inc. FBD acquisition completed in 2021 was revalued at December 31, 2023. The remaining contingent consideration accrual was adjusted to the maximum potential amount of million, using a potential probability of achievement of . The Company made the required million payment during the third quarter of 2024.

 million, based on actual retained revenue results. The remaining contingent consideration liability related to the TGA acquisition was revalued at December 31, 2023 for an adjusted fair value of million. In the third quarter of 2024, the liability was revalued to million based on actual results and the final payment was made. The first required payment was made on the CPD contingent consideration in the second quarter of 2024 in the amount of million and a second payment was made during the third quarter of 2024 in the amount of million based on satisfaction of certain customer retention requirements. The Company determines fair values based on quoted market values, where available, estimates of present values, or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including, but not limited to, the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs used in the determination of fair value of assets classified as Level 3 on a recurring or non-recurring basis are as follows: Fair value of collateral Estimated cost of disposal/market adjustment Other real estate owned Fair value of collateral Estimated cost of disposal/market adjustment - Commitments to originate real estate loans for sale Discounted cash flow Embedded servicing value Mortgage servicing rights Discounted cash flow Weighted average constant prepayment rate - Weighted average discount rate - Adequate compensation /loan Contingent consideration ) Discounted cash flow Discount rate Probability of achievement

The weighted average of the estimated cost of disposal/market adjustment for individually assessed loans was calculated by dividing the total of the book value of the collateral of the individually assessed loans classified as Level 3 by the total of the fair value of the collateral of the individually assessed loans classified as Level 3. The weighted average of the estimated cost of disposal/market adjustment for other real estate owned was calculated by dividing the total of the differences between the appraisal values of the real estate and the book values of the real estate divided by the totals of the appraisal values of the real estate. The weighted average of the constant prepayment rate for mortgage servicing rights was calculated by adding the constant prepayment rates used in each loan pool weighted by the balance in each loan pool. The weighted average of the discount rate for mortgage servicing rights was calculated by adding the discount rates used in each loan pool weighted by the balance in each loan pool. The weighted average of the discount rate for the contingent consideration was calculated by adding the discount rates used for the calculation of the fair value of each payment of contingent consideration, weighted by the amount of the payment as part of the total fair value of contingent consideration. The weighted average of the probability of achievement was determined by calculating the proportion of the probability-weighted payment of the total maximum payment, weighted by the amount of the payment as part of the total fair value of contingent consideration.

 Held-to-maturity securities Financial liabilities: Deposits Overnight borrowings Securities sold under agreement to repurchase, short-term Other Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings The following is a further description of the principal valuation methods used by the Company to estimate the fair values of its financial instruments. Loans have been classified as a Level 3 valuation. Fair values for variable rate loans that reprice frequently are based on carrying values. Fair values for fixed rate loans are estimated using discounted cash flows and interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. Held-to-maturity U.S. Treasury and agency securities have been classified as a Level 1 valuation. The fair values of held-to-maturity U.S. Treasury and agency investment securities are based upon quoted prices, if available. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using quoted market prices for similar securities or model-based valuation techniques. Held-to-maturity government agency mortgage-backed securities have been classified as a Level 2 valuation. The fair values of held-to-maturity government agency mortgage-backed securities are based on current market rates for similar products. Deposits have been classified as a Level 2 valuation. The fair value of demand deposits, interest-bearing checking deposits, savings accounts and money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of time deposit obligations are based on current market rates for similar securities. Borrowings have been classified as a Level 2 valuation. The fair value of overnight borrowings and securities sold under agreement to repurchase, short-term, is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. Fair values for other FHLB borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flows and interest rates currently being offered on similar securities. Other financial assets and liabilities Cash and cash equivalents have been classified as a Level 1 valuation, while accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable have been classified as a Level 2 valuation. The fair values of each approximate the respective carrying values because the instruments are payable on demand or have short-term maturities and present relatively low credit risk and interest rate risk.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A primarily reviews the financial condition and results of operations of Community Financial System, Inc. (the Company or CFSI as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, although in some circumstances the second and first quarters of 2024 are also discussed in order to more fully explain recent trends. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes that appear on pages 3 through 41. All references in the discussion of the financial condition and results of operations refer to the consolidated position and results of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. Unless otherwise noted, the term this year and equivalent terms refers to results in calendar year 2024, last year and equivalent terms refer to calendar year 2023, third quarter refers to the three months ended September 30, 2024, YTD refers to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and earnings per share EPS figures refer to diluted EPS. This MD A contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, and business of the Company. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements are set herein under the caption Forward-Looking Statements on page 67. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates As a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the Company s business, management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations. The policy decision process not only ensures compliance with the current accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), but also reflects management s discretion with regard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the Company s financial performance. It is management s opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity in the selection process. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosures of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could meaningfully differ from these estimates. Management considers its critical accounting estimates those that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. Management believes that the critical accounting estimates include the allowance for credit losses; actuarial assumptions associated with the pension, post-retirement and other employee benefit plans; and the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets. A summary of the critical accounting policies and estimates used by management is disclosed in the MD A on pages 32-34 of the most recent Form 10-K (fiscal year ended December 31, 2023) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 29, 2024, and there have been no material changes other than those described below regarding the Allowance for Credit Losses. A summary of new accounting policies used by management is disclosed in Note C, Accounting Policies beginning on page 11 of this Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents 
 Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses ACL represents management s judgment of an estimated amount of lifetime losses expected to be incurred on outstanding loans at the balance sheet date. This is estimated using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The determination of the appropriateness of the ACL is complex and applies significant and highly subjective estimates. The ACL is measured on a collective (pooled) basis for loan segments that share similar risk characteristics, including collateral type, credit ratings/scores, size, duration, interest rate structure, origination vintage and payment structure. The Company utilizes three methods for calculating the ACL: cumulative loss, vintage loss and line loss. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected future credit losses in all three methodologies. Qualitative adjustments are made for differences in loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, acquisition status, current levels of delinquencies, net charge-offs and risk ratings, as well as actual and forecasted macroeconomic variables. Macroeconomic data includes unemployment rates, changes in collateral values such as home prices, commercial real estate prices including office property-specific price forecasts, office property-specific vacancy rates, automobile prices, gross domestic product, median household income net of inflation and other relevant factors. Management utilizes judgment in determining and applying the qualitative factors and weighting the economic scenarios used, which include baseline, upside and downside forecasts. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company updated the ACL model to add 2023 results into the historical data used for calculating the quantitative and qualitative factors as part of the annual model update procedures. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company updated the ACL model to incorporate office property-specific price forecasts and office property-specific vacancy forecasts to provide greater precision to the model. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company applied an additional qualitative overlay to the factor for volume and size of business lending loans and risk rating trends to capture future loss expectations in that portfolio. The combination of these factors, loan balance increases, and other qualitative factors drove a 4.7 million net increase in the ACL during the third quarter. One of the most significant estimates and judgments influencing the results of the ACL calculation is the macroeconomic forecasts. Changes in these economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated expected credit losses and lead to materially different amounts from one period to the next. To illustrate the sensitivity of the ACL calculation to these economic forecasts, management performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis using a weighting of 100 to the downside forecast, rather than the existing weighting of baseline, upside and downside of 40 , 30 and 30 , respectively. The scenario-weighted average unemployment rate and GDP growth forecasts used in the ACL model at September 30, 2024 were 4.8 and 1.9 , respectively, compared to 4.6 and 1.8 at June 30, 2024, respectively. The hypothetical downside forecast includes assumptions of a weakening economy represented by a cumulative decline in real GDP of 2.6 , enhanced geopolitical tensions, elevated inflation, a peak unemployment rate of 8.3 and an average unemployment rate of 6.9 . The Company calculated that this hypothetical scenario would increase the ACL and provision for credit losses as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by approximately 4.9 million, and decrease net income by 3.7 million (net of tax). This change is reflective of the sensitivity of the various economic factors used in the ACL model. The resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels, as future conditions are uncertain and there are several other quantitative and qualitative factors that will also fluctuate concurrent with changing economic conditions, which would affect the results of the ACL calculation. The impact that the economic factors have on the model is affected by the upside or downside severity of the scenarios used, the product type mix, and the interaction of the economic factors with other quantitative and qualitative factors in the model, as changes in any particular factor or input may not occur at the same rate or be directionally consistent across all loan segments. Improvements in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors, both qualitative and quantitative. The third-party downside economic forecast used in the hypothetical scenario described does not predict a severe economic downturn, but rather a moderate recessionary environment. The Company s geographic distribution of loans primarily outside of major metropolitan areas, combined with low statistical correlation between its historical losses and national economic indicators, results in economic-related changes to the allowance that are less significant as compared to national economic activity.

 Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations The Company also provides supplemental reporting of its results on an operating or tangible basis. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company modified the presentation of its non-GAAP operating results to exclude amortization of intangible assets which the Company believes better reflects core performance across its segments and enhances comparability to both banking and non-banking organizations. The prior period has been recast to conform to the current period presentation. Results on an operating basis exclude the after-tax effects of acquisition expenses, litigation accrual, gain on debt extinguishment, loss on sales of investment securities, unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities and amortization of intangible assets. Results on a tangible basis exclude goodwill and intangible asset balances, net of accumulated amortization and applicable deferred tax amounts. Although these items are non-GAAP measures, the Company s management believes this information helps investors and analysts measure underlying core performance and improves comparability to other organizations that have not engaged in acquisitions or restructuring activities. In addition, the Company provides supplemental reporting for operating pre-tax, pre-provision net revenues, which excludes the provision for credit losses, acquisition expenses, litigation accrual, gain on debt extinguishment, loss on sales of investment securities, unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities and amortization of intangible assets from income before income taxes. Although operating pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue is a non-GAAP measure, the Company s management believes this information helps investors and analysts measure and compare the Company s performance through a credit cycle by excluding the volatility in the provision for credit losses associated with the impact of CECL, helps investors and analysts measure underlying core performance and improves comparability to other organizations that have not engaged in acquisitions or restructuring activities. The Company also provides supplemental reporting of its interest income, net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent FTE basis, which includes an adjustment to interest income and net interest income that represents taxes that would have been paid had nontaxable investment securities and loans been taxable. Although fully tax-equivalent interest income, net interest income and net interest margin are non-GAAP measures, the Company s management believes this information helps enhance comparability of the performance of assets that have different tax liabilities. Reconciliations of GAAP amounts with corresponding non-GAAP amounts are presented in Table 14. Executive Summary The Company s business philosophy is to operate as a diversified financial services enterprise providing a broad array of banking and other financial services, including employee benefit services, insurance services and wealth management services, to retail, commercial, institutional and municipal customers. The Company s banking subsidiary is Community Bank, N.A. (the Bank or CBNA ). The Company s Benefit Plans Administrative Services, Inc. BPAS subsidiary is a leading provider of employee benefits administration, trust services, collective investment fund administration and actuarial consulting services to customers on a national scale.

 Third quarter 2024 net income decreased 0.2 million, or 0.5 , compared to the third quarter of 2023, while YTD net income increased 34.5 million, or 35.1 compared to the equivalent 2023 timeframe. Earnings per share of 0.83 for the third quarter of 2024 was 0.01 more than the third quarter of 2023, while 2024 YTD earnings per share of 2.50 was 0.68 higher than 2023 YTD earnings per share. Although net income decreased slightly between the quarterly periods due to increases in noninterest expenses, the provision for credit losses and income taxes, partially offset by increases in noninterest revenues and net interest income, earnings per share increased between the quarterly periods as the number of fully-diluted shares outstanding decreased reflective of share repurchases between the periods. The YTD increase in net income and earnings per share was primarily the result of a 52.3 million pre-tax realized loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale investment securities during the first quarter of 2023 in connection with a balance sheet repositioning. Increases in income taxes, noninterest expenses and the provision for credit losses were partially offset by increases in noninterest revenues excluding realized investment security losses and net interest income and a decrease in the number of fully-diluted shares outstanding. Third quarter and YTD operating net income, a non-GAAP measure, decreased 0.4 million, or 0.9 , as compared to the third quarter of 2023 and decreased 7.9 million, or 5.3 , compared to September YTD 2023. Third quarter and YTD operating earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, increased 0.01 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and decreased 0.11 compared to September YTD 2023. Third quarter and YTD operating pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue per share, a non-GAAP measure, increased 0.13 compared to the third quarter of 2023 and increased 0.12 compared to September YTD 2023, demonstrating improvement in the Company s core operating performance between the periods. Net interest margin decreased four basis points between the third quarter of 2023 and the third quarter of 2024 and decreased 13 basis points on a YTD basis. Fully tax-equivalent net interest margin, a non-GAAP measure, decreased five basis points between the third quarter of 2023 and the third quarter of 2024 and decreased 14 basis points on a YTD basis. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased 49 basis points compared to the prior year third quarter and 54 basis points compared to the prior YTD period, as the yield on average loans and average investments both improved. The yield on average loans for the third quarter of 2024 increased 59 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023 and 62 basis points between comparable YTD periods. The increase in yield on average loans was driven by higher interest rates on new loans and an increase in variable and adjustable-rate loan yields. The yield on average investments, including cash equivalents, increased eight basis points compared to the prior year s third quarter and 10 basis points on a YTD basis, primarily reflective of the purchases of certain higher-yielding government agency mortgage-backed securities between the periods. The Company s total cost of funds increased 56 basis points from last year s third quarter and 71 basis points YTD, as the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits and the rate paid on borrowings both increased largely due to market-driven increases in deposit and borrowing rates, as well as the higher proportion of funding coming from comparatively higher rate time deposits and external borrowings. Loan balances increased on both an average and ending basis as compared to the prior year third quarter and YTD period, reflective of continued strong organic loan growth. Deposit balances also increased on both an average and ending basis as compared to the third quarter of 2023 and YTD due primarily to growth in municipal deposit balances. Investment book balances, including cash equivalents, decreased on both an average and ending basis as compared to the prior year third quarter and YTD period. The decrease on an average YTD basis was primarily due to the maturities and sales of certain available-for-sale investment securities between the periods while the decrease on an ending basis was driven by a decrease in cash equivalents due in part to the funding of strong loan growth. Borrowing balances increased on both an average and ending basis compared to the third quarter of 2023 and YTD as the Company secured certain fixed rate Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB term borrowings between the periods, reflective of the Company s net earning asset growth exceeding the increase in deposit balances. Reflective of a slightly adverse change in certain asset quality metrics, an increase in loans outstanding and continued macroeconomic uncertainty primarily concerning the business lending and consumer indirect portfolios, the Company recorded a 7.7 million provision for credit losses during the third quarter and 16.6 million for YTD 2024 resulting in a 4.8 million and 9.4 million higher provision for credit losses than comparable prior year periods, respectively, as the Company increased credit loss reserves primarily related to the business lending and consumer indirect portfolios. Asset quality remained favorable relative to long-term historical averages during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 although certain metrics did weaken as compared to the prior year periods. Net charge-offs were 2.8 million, or an annualized 0.11 of average loans, for the third quarter and 6.9 million, or an annualized 0.09 of average loans, for the first nine months of 2024, compared to net charge-offs of 1.2 million, or an annualized 0.05 of average loans, for the prior year s third quarter and 3.5 million, or an annualized 0.05 of average loans, for the first nine months of 2023. The nonperforming loan ratio of 0.61 at September 30, 2024 increased 22 basis points from September 30, 2023 primarily driven by the business loans associated with five loan relationships being downgraded from accruing to nonaccrual status. The nonperforming loan ratio increased 11 basis points from June 30, 2024 primarily driven by the business loans associated with one customer being downgraded from accruing to nonaccrual status. The 30 to 89 day delinquent loan ratio remained low at 0.46 , down from 0.51 at the end of the third quarter of 2023 and up slightly from 0.45 at the end of the prior quarter.

 Banking noninterest revenues, comprised of deposit service fees, mortgage banking and other banking services revenues, increased 3.0 million, or 17.1 , as compared to the prior year s third quarter, and increased 6.7 million, or 13.0 , between the comparable YTD periods. The growth between both periods included increases in mortgage banking revenues that reflected higher sales volumes of secondary market eligible residential mortgage loans, higher valuation of mortgage servicing rights and increases in other banking services revenues associated with higher interest rate swap fees due to the recent implementation of this product offering, as well as increased revenues from commercial real estate transaction services. Financial services business revenues, comprised of employee benefit services, insurance services and wealth management services revenues, increased 5.7 million, or 11.4 , as compared to the prior year s third quarter and increased 14.4 million, or 9.8 , compared to the prior YTD period, reflecting revenue growth in all three segments between both periods. Noninterest expenses increased 7.7 million, or 6.6 , between the third quarter of 2023 and the third quarter of 2024 and increased 17.7 million, or 5.1 , between September YTD 2023 and September YTD 2024. The increases were primarily driven by salaries and employee benefits that increased 7.3 million, or 10.4 , and 14.3 million, or 6.8 , for the third quarter and YTD periods of 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of 2023, reflective of merit and market-related increases in employee wages, higher incentive plan costs and acquisitions between the periods, partially offset by the impact of the previously announced retail customer service workforce optimization plan. The remaining increase in noninterest expenses were largely due to higher data processing and communications expenses reflective of the Company s continued investment in customer-facing and back-office technologies including investments in additional technology to enhance its cybersecurity infrastructure, including the detection and prevention of customer payment-related fraud combined with an increase in other expenses driven by increases in insurance expenses and property-related write-downs and a decrease in the net periodic pension benefit credit due to lower non-service related components. The Company s deposit base and liquidity position continues to be strong, as the Company had total immediately available liquidity sources of 4.49 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2024, approximately double its estimated uninsured deposits, net of collateralized and intercompany deposits. Estimated insured deposits, net of collateralized and intercompany deposits, represent greater than 80 of total deposits at the end of the third quarter. The Company s deposit base is well diversified across customer segments, which as of September 30, 2024 was comprised of approximately 58 consumer, 27 business and 15 municipal, and broadly dispersed, illustrated by an average deposit balance per account that was under 20,000. Since the Federal Reserve began raising the federal funds rate in March 2022 in an effort to combat inflation, the deposit beta (change in the Company s cost of funds as a proportion of the change in the federal funds rate) for the Company was 24 and the cycle-to-date total funding beta was 28 of the cumulative 475 basis point increase in the federal funds rate. The lower betas are reflective of a comparatively high proportion of non-interest-bearing deposits, representing approximately 27 of total ending third quarter deposits, and the composition and stability of the customer base. In addition, 65 of the Company s total deposits were in noninterest checking, interest checking and savings accounts at the end of the third quarter. The Company did not utilize brokered or wholesale deposits. Net Income and Profitability As shown in Table 1, net income for the third quarter and September YTD of 43.9 million and 132.7 million, respectively, decreased 0.2 million, or 0.5 , as compared to the third quarter of 2023 and increased 34.5 million, or 35.1 , compared to September YTD 2023. Earnings per share of 0.83 for the third quarter was 0.01 higher than the third quarter of 2023, while earnings per share for the first nine months of 2024 of 2.50 was 0.68 higher than the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in net income for the quarter was the result of increases in noninterest expenses, the provision for credit losses and income taxes, partially offset by increases in net interest income and noninterest revenues. The increase in earnings per share for the quarter was the result of a decrease in fully diluted shares outstanding, which offset the slight decline in net income. The increase in net income and earnings per share for the YTD period as compared to the prior year was primarily the result of the realized loss on the sales of investment securities that was recognized in the first quarter of 2023 as part of a balance sheet repositioning. Additionally, an increase in all other noninterest revenues and net interest income, as well as a decrease in fully diluted shares outstanding, was partially offset by an increase in noninterest expenses, income taxes and the provision for credit losses. Operating net income, a non-GAAP measure, of 46.6 million and 140.9 million for the third quarter and September YTD 2024, respectively, decreased 0.4 million, or 0.9 , as compared to the third quarter of 2023 and decreased 7.9 million, or 5.3 , compared to September YTD 2023. Operating earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, of 0.88 for the third quarter increased 0.01 compared to the third quarter of 2023, while operating earnings per share of 2.65 for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 0.11 compared to the first nine months of 2023. See Table 14 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.

 As reflected in Table 1, third quarter net interest income of 112.7 million increased 5.0 million, or 4.6 , from the comparable prior year period. The quarterly improvement resulted from an increase in the balance of and yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase in the balance of and rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income for the first nine months of 2024 increased 1.0 million, or 0.3 , versus the first nine months of 2023. The YTD increase was primarily the result of a higher balance and yield on interest-earning assets due in part to a higher proportion of those assets being comprised of loan balances due to strong organic loan growth, and the sales and maturities of certain lower-yielding available-for-sale investment securities, partially offset by an increase in the balance and cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Reflective of slight adverse changes in certain asset quality metrics, an increase in loans outstanding and continued macroeconomic uncertainty primarily concerning the business lending and consumer indirect portfolios, the provision for credit losses of 7.7 million for the third quarter and 16.6 million for September YTD increased 4.8 million and 9.4 million as compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily related to the business lending and consumer indirect portfolios. Third quarter and year-to-date noninterest revenues were 76.2 million and 220.9 million, respectively, an increase of 8.6 million, or 12.7 , from the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of 73.8 million, or 50.2 , from the first nine months of 2023. Total operating noninterest revenues, a non-GAAP measure, for the third quarter and September YTD were 76.4 million and 220.4 million, respectively, an increase of 8.7 million, or 12.9 , and 21.1 million, or 10.6 , from the prior third quarter and YTD period, respectively. The increase over the prior year third quarter was driven by a 5.7 million, or 11.4 , increase in financial services business revenues and a 3.0 million, or 17.1 , increase in banking noninterest revenues. The increase over the prior September YTD period was driven by a 14.4 million, or 9.8 , increase in financial services business revenues and a 6.7 million, or 13.0 , increase in banking noninterest revenues. Noninterest expenses of 124.2 million and 361.3 million for the third quarter and September YTD periods, respectively, reflected an increase of 7.7 million, or 6.6 , from the third quarter of 2023 and an increase of 17.7 million, or 5.1 , from the first nine months of 2023. The increase in noninterest expenses for the third quarter and September YTD periods was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, data processing and communications and other expenses. Operating noninterest expenses, a non-GAAP measure, increased 8.0 million, or 7.1 , from the prior year third quarter, and 18.7 million, or 5.6 , from the prior September YTD. The effective income tax rates were 23.0 and 22.9 for third quarter and YTD 2024, respectively, as compared to 21.2 and 21.1 for the comparable prior year periods, primarily due to a higher full year projected pre-tax income result and a higher proportion of income from fully taxable sources. A condensed income statement is as follows: Table 1: Condensed Income Statements

 Net Interest Income Net interest income is the amount by which interest, dividends and fees on interest-earning assets (loans, investments and cash equivalents) exceeds the cost of funds, which consists primarily of interest paid to the Company s depositors and interest paid on borrowings. Net interest margin is the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities as a percentage of interest-earning assets. Net interest income totaled 112.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 and was a new quarterly record for the Company. This compares to 107.8 million of net interest income for the third quarter of 2023. As shown in Table 2a, fully tax-equivalent net interest income, a non-GAAP measure, for the third quarter was 113.6 million, also a new quarterly record for the Company, compared to 108.8 million for the third quarter of the prior year. The increase was driven by a 49 basis point increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets and an 850.4 million increase in average interest-earning asset balances, partially offset by a 70 basis point increase in the rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities and a 986.0 million increase in average interest-bearing liability balances in comparison to the third quarter of 2023. As reflected in Table 3 for the quarter, the favorable net interest income impacts of the increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets of 17.4 million and the volume increase in average interest-earning asset balances of 8.8 million were partially offset by the unfavorable net interest income impacts of the increase in the rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities of 17.9 million and the volume increase in average interest-bearing liability balances of 3.5 million. Net interest income totaled 329.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 328.1 million for the first nine months of 2023. As reflected in Table 2b, September YTD fully tax-equivalent net interest income, a non-GAAP measure, of 332.0 million, increased 0.7 million, or 0.2 , from the year-earlier period. The September YTD increase resulted from a 54 basis point increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets and a 631.0 million increase in average interest-earning asset balances, partially offset by a 91 basis point increase in the rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities and an 877.2 million increase in average interest-bearing liability balances. As reflected in Table 3 for September YTD, the favorable impacts of the increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets of 59.7 million and the volume increase in average interest-earning asset balances of 18.5 million were partially offset by the unfavorable net interest income impacts of the increase in the rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities of 70.7 million and the volume increase in average interest-bearing liability balances of 6.8 million. Net interest margin of 3.03 for the third quarter of 2024 was four basis points lower as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The fully tax-equivalent net interest margin, a non-GAAP measure, of 3.05 for the third quarter of 2024 was five basis points lower as compared to the prior year s third quarter. Net interest margin of 3.00 and fully tax-equivalent net interest margin, a non-GAAP measure, of 3.02 for the first nine months of 2024 were lower by 13 basis points and 14 basis points, respectively, than the comparable period of 2023. The decreases were the result of the increase in the rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by the increase in the yield on average interest-earnings assets and a higher proportion of those assets being comprised of loan balances due to strong organic loan growth and the sales and maturities of certain lower-yielding available-for-sale investment securities between the YTD periods. The decline in noninterest and low rate checking and savings deposit balances combined with an increase in time and money market deposit balances also had an adverse impact on the net interest margin and fully tax-equivalent net interest margin, a non-GAAP measure, between both periods. The 49 basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets for the quarter was the result of increases in both the yield on average loans and the yield on average investments, including cash equivalents. The yield on average loans for the third quarter increased by 59 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023. The third quarter of 2024 yield on average investments, including cash equivalents, increased eight basis points compared to the prior year while the yield on average investments, excluding cash equivalents, increased nine basis points for the same timeframe. The 54 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets for the first nine months of 2024 was the result of a 62 basis point increase in the yield on average loans and a 10 basis point increase in the yield on average investments, including cash equivalents, compared to the prior YTD period. Excluding cash equivalents, the yield on average investments increased five basis points compared to the prior YTD period. The increase in loan yields were reflective of higher interest rates on new loans and an increase in certain variable and adjustable-rate loan yields. As the majority of the Company s investment portfolio, excluding cash equivalents, is comprised of fixed yield securities, the increase in investment yields were driven by the sales and maturities of certain lower-yielding available-for-sale investment securities and the purchases of certain higher-yielding government agency mortgage-backed securities between the periods.

 The third quarter and YTD average book balance of investments, including cash equivalents, decreased 1.4 million and 252.4 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The YTD decrease was primarily due to declines in the investment securities portfolio driven by scheduled maturities and the sales of certain available-for-sale investment securities. Investment purchases outpaced sales, maturities, calls and principal payments during the current third quarter and YTD periods, driven by 128.8 million of YTD government agency mortgage-backed securities purchases classified as held-to-maturity. The cash equivalents component of average interest-earning assets decreased 14.8 million and increased 69.0 million for the third quarter and YTD periods, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. Average loan balances increased 851.9 million for the quarter and 883.4 million YTD as compared to the prior year, with increases in all five major loan portfolios between both periods due to high levels of organic growth. The rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased by 70 basis points compared to the prior year quarter as the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 60 basis points and the average rate paid on external borrowings increased 74 basis points from the comparable prior period. For the first nine months of 2024, the rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased by 91 basis points from the comparable prior year period as the rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits increased 85 basis points and the rate paid on average external borrowings increased 96 basis points. The increase in the rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits was due to interest rates on certain interest-bearing deposits being raised in response to market conditions, including the effects of a 100 basis point increase in the Federal Funds rate during 2023 as a result of the Federal Reserve Bank s Federal Reserve or FRB efforts to lower elevated inflation, and a shift in deposit mix as customers responded to changes in market interest rates by moving funds into higher yielding account types. The increase in the rate paid on average borrowings was primarily the result of the Company securing 400.0 million of fixed rate FHLB term borrowings in the third and fourth quarters of 2023, 150.0 million of additional fixed rate FHLB term borrowings in the second quarter of 2024 and 100.0 million of additional fixed rate FHLB term borrowings in the third quarter of 2024 to help meet the Company s funding needs, which reduced the proportion of lower rate securities sold under agreement to repurchase (customer repurchase agreements) to total borrowings. Average interest-bearing deposits increased 575.3 million compared to the prior year quarter and 579.1 million compared to the prior YTD period. The quarterly and YTD increases in average interest-bearing deposits were due to increases in time and money market deposits, partially offset by decreases in savings and interest checking deposits reflective of the aforementioned shift in deposit mix and net municipal deposit balance inflows. The average borrowing balance, which primarily includes borrowings at the FHLB and customer repurchase agreements, increased 410.7 million and 298.1 million for the quarter and YTD periods, respectively. The increase in average borrowings from the prior year quarter and YTD periods was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in FHLB term borrowings to meet the Company s funding needs, as earning asset growth outpaced the increase in deposit balances. Tables 2a and 2b below sets forth information related to average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and their associated yields and rates for the periods indicated. Interest income and yields are on a fully tax-equivalent FTE basis using a marginal income tax rate of 24.4 in 2024 and 24.2 in 2023. Average balances are computed by totaling the daily ending balances in a period and dividing by the number of days in that period. Loan interest income and yields include amortization of deferred loan income and costs, loan prepayment, late and other fees and the accretion of acquired loan purchase discounts and premiums. Average loan balances include acquired loan purchase discounts and premiums, nonaccrual loans and loans held for sale.

 (1) The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of such change in each component. (2) Changes due to volume and rate are computed from the respective changes in average balances and rates of the totals; they are not a summation of the changes of the components. 
 Noninterest Revenues The Company s sources of noninterest revenues are of four primary types: 1) general banking services related to loans, including mortgage banking, deposits and other core customer activities typically provided through the branch network and digital banking channels (performed by CBNA); 2) employee benefit trust, collective investment fund, transfer agency, actuarial, benefit plan administration and recordkeeping services (performed by BPAS and its subsidiaries); 3) wealth management services, comprised of trust services (performed by the Nottingham Trust division within CBNA), broker-dealer and investment advisory products and services (performed by Community Investment Services Inc. CISI ), OneGroup Wealth Partners, Inc. and The Carta Group, Inc.) and asset management services (performed by Nottingham Advisors, Inc.); and 4) insurance and risk management products and services (performed by OneGroup). Additionally, the Company has other transactions that impact noninterest revenues, including realized and unrealized gains or losses on investment securities and gains or losses on debt extinguishment.

 (1) Operating noninterest revenues, a non-GAAP measure, excludes loss on sales of investment securities, gain on debt extinguishment and unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities from total noninterest revenues. Operating revenues, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net interest income on a FTE basis plus noninterest revenues, excluding loss on sales of investment securities, gain on debt extinguishment, and unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities. See Table 14 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures. 
 As displayed in Table 4, noninterest revenues totaled 76.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 220.9 million for the first nine months of 2024. This represents an increase of 8.6 million, or 12.7 , for the quarter and an increase of 73.8 million, or 50.2 , for the YTD period in comparison to the equivalent 2023 periods. Noninterest revenues for the YTD periods of 2024 included a 1.0 million unrealized gain on equity securities primarily associated with the conversion of certain Visa Class B shares to Visa Class C shares and a 0.5 million loss on sales of investment securities associated with the sales of certain available-for-sale investment securities. Noninterest revenues for the first nine months of 2023 included a 52.3 million pre-tax realized loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale securities in connection with a strategic balance sheet repositioning executed during the prior year s first quarter, a 0.1 million unrealized loss on equity securities and a 0.2 million gain on debt extinguishment. Operating noninterest revenues, a non-GAAP measure as defined in the table above, totaled 76.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 8.7 million, or 12.9 , from the prior year s third quarter and totaled 220.4 million for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 21.1 million, or 10.6 , from the first nine months of 2023. The increases between both periods reflected growth in all of the primary business categories: employee benefit services revenues, the four banking noninterest revenue lines, insurance services revenues and wealth management services revenues. Employee benefit services revenues increased 3.2 million, or 10.7 , and 9.1 million, or 10.3 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the equivalent prior year periods, driven by new business and increases in the total participants under administration, growth in asset-based fee revenues, resulting from market appreciation and the acquisition of certain assets of Creative Plan Designs Limited, a provider of employee benefit plan design, administration and consulting, on February 1, 2024. Banking noninterest revenues increased 3.0 million, or 17.1 , between the third quarter of 2023 and 2024 and increased 6.7 million, or 13.0 , between the first nine months of 2023 and 2024. The growth between both periods was driven by increases in mortgage banking revenues (increased 0.9 million for the quarter and 3.3 million YTD), deposit service charges and fees (increased 0.9 million for the quarter and 1.9 million YTD), debit interchange and ATM fees (increased 0.8 million YTD) and other banking revenues (increased 1.2 million for the quarter and 0.7 million YTD). The increases in mortgage banking revenues reflected higher sales volumes of secondary market eligible residential mortgage loans and an increase in the value of mortgage servicing rights. The increases in other banking revenues were associated with higher interest rate swap fee revenues due to the recent implementation of this product offering and other commercial banking-related fees.

 Insurance services revenues increased 1.5 million, or 12.7 , and 2.6 million, or 7.2 , for the third quarter and YTD periods, respectively, due to organic and acquired growth in commissions revenues, including the incremental revenues resulting from the acquisition of a New York-based insurance agency for 4.6 million in total consideration on April 1, 2024. Wealth management services revenues increased 1.0 million, or 12.1 , for the third quarter of 2024 and 2.8 million, or 11.5 , for September 2024 YTD as compared to the same time periods of 2023, as more favorable investment market conditions drove an increase in the value of assets under management between the periods. The ratio of noninterest revenues to total revenues was 40.3 for the third quarter of 2024 and 40.2 for September YTD 2024, compared to 38.5 for the prior year s third quarter and 31.0 for September YTD 2023. The quarterly increase was due to noninterest revenues increasing 12.7 while net interest income increased 4.6 . The YTD increase was primarily the result of the 73.8 million, or 50.2 , increase in total noninterest revenues due to the aforementioned 52.3 million realized loss on sales of investment securities recognized in the prior year s first quarter, while net interest income increased 0.3 . The ratio of operating noninterest revenues to operating revenues (FTE), a non-GAAP measure as defined in the table above, was 40.2 for the quarter and 39.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus 38.3 and 37.8 for the comparable periods of 2023. The increase between the quarterly periods was due to a 12.9 increase in operating noninterest revenues, a non-GAAP measure, due to the factors noted above, while fully tax-equivalent net interest income, a non-GAAP measure, increased 4.4 . The year-to-date increase was the result of a 10.6 increase in operating noninterest revenues, a non-GAAP measure, due to the factors noted above, while fully tax-equivalent net interest income, a non-GAAP measure, increased 0.2 . Noninterest Expenses Table 5 below sets forth the quarterly and YTD results of the major noninterest expense categories for the current and prior year, as well as efficiency ratios (defined below), a standard measure of expense utilization effectiveness commonly used in the banking industry.

 (1) Operating noninterest expenses, a non-GAAP measure, is calculated as total noninterest expenses less acquisition expenses, acquisition-related contingent consideration adjustments, litigation accrual and amortization of intangibles. See Table 14 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures. (2) Operating efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure, is calculated as operating expenses as defined in footnote (1) above divided by net interest income on a FTE basis plus noninterest revenues excluding loss on sales of investment securities, gain on debt extinguishment and unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities. See Table 14 for Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.

Table of Contents 
 As shown in Table 5, the Company recorded noninterest expenses of 124.2 million and 361.3 million for the third quarter and YTD periods of 2024, respectively, representing an increase of 7.7 million, or 6.6 , and an increase of 17.7 million, or 5.1 , from the prior year periods, respectively. The increases were primarily driven by salaries and employee benefits that increased 7.3 million, or 10.4 , and 14.3 million, or 6.8 , for the third quarter and YTD periods of 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of 2023. The remaining change to noninterest expenses is attributable to increases in data processing and communications (up 0.4 million for the quarter and 2.6 million YTD), occupancy and equipment (up 0.2 million for the quarter and 0.8 million YTD), acquisition expenses (up 0.1 million for the quarter and YTD), litigation accrual (up 0.1 million for the quarter and 0.2 million YTD) and other expenses (up 0.3 million for the quarter and 2.1 million YTD). The increases were partially offset by decreases in amortization of intangible assets (down 0.2 million for the quarter and 0.1 million YTD), legal and professional fees (down 0.1 million for the quarter and 0.6 million YTD), business development and marketing (down 0.3 million for the quarter and 0.5 million YTD) and acquisition-related contingent consideration adjustments (down 0.2 million for the quarter and 1.2 million YTD). The increases in salaries and benefits expense were driven by merit and market-related increases in employee wages, higher incentive plan costs and acquisitions between the periods, partially offset by the impact of the previously announced retail customer service workforce optimization plan. The increases in data processing and communications expenses are reflective of the Company s continued investment in customer-facing and back-office technologies including investments in additional technology to enhance its cybersecurity infrastructure, in part related to the detection and prevention of customer payment-related fraud. The increase in other expenses on a YTD basis was primarily due to increases in insurance expenses, property-related writedowns and non-service related components lowering the net periodic pension benefit credit. The increase in insurance expenses included 0.2 million associated with an additional expected increase to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of certain banks in the first quarter of 2023, along with the impact of a higher FDIC insurance assessment rate. The Company s GAAP efficiency ratio was 65.7 for the third quarter of 2024, 0.7 percentage points favorable to the comparable quarter of 2023. This resulted from total revenues increasing 7.7 , due to increases in both noninterest revenues and net interest income, while total noninterest expenses increased 6.6 due to the factors noted above. The GAAP efficiency ratio of 65.7 for September YTD 2024 was 6.6 percentage points favorable to the 72.3 GAAP efficiency ratio for September YTD 2023. The improvement in the GAAP efficiency ratio between the comparable YTD periods was the result of total revenues increasing 15.8 primarily due to the 52.3 million pre-tax realized loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale securities during the first quarter of 2023, while total noninterest expenses increased 5.1 due to the factors noted above. Annualized current quarter noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets increased 0.02 percentage points versus the third quarter of the prior year as noninterest expenses increased 6.6 while average assets increased 6.2 . On a YTD basis, annualized noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets also increased 0.02 percentage points as noninterest expenses increased 5.1 while average assets increased 4.4 . Noninterest expenses increased between both periods due to the factors noted above and average assets increased between both periods primarily due to the aforementioned organic loan growth. The Company s operating efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure as defined in the table above, was 63.6 for the third quarter, 0.4 percentage points favorable to the comparable quarter of 2023. This resulted from operating revenues (FTE), a non-GAAP measure, increasing 7.7 while operating noninterest expenses, a non-GAAP measure, increased 7.1 . The Company s operating efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure, of 63.4 for the first nine months of 2024 was 0.9 percentage points unfavorable compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to 5.6 higher operating noninterest expenses, a non-GAAP measure as described above, while operating revenues (FTE), a non-GAAP measure as described above, increased by 4.1 . Annualized current year operating noninterest expenses, a non-GAAP measure as described above, as a percentage of average assets increased 0.03 percentage points versus the prior year quarter and increased 0.04 percentage points versus the prior year-to-date period as operating noninterest expenses, a non-GAAP measure as described above, increased at a higher rate than average assets on both a quarterly and YTD basis. Operating noninterest expenses, a non-GAAP measure, increased 7.1 for the quarter and 5.6 for the year-to-date period, while average assets increased 6.2 for the quarter and 4.4 for the year-to-date period. Income Taxes The third quarter and YTD 2024 effective income tax rates were 23.0 and 22.9 , respectively, as compared to 21.2 and 21.1 for the comparable periods of 2023. The increase in the third quarter and YTD 2024 effective income tax rates are primarily attributable to an increase in the full-year 2024 pre-tax income projection as compared to the prior year, as the prior YTD included a 52.3 million realized loss on sales of investment securities and a higher proportion of pre-tax income being generated from fully taxable sources.

 Investment Securities The carrying value of investment securities was 4.29 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 122.2 million, or 2.9 , from December 31, 2023 and an increase of 327.5 million, or 8.3 , from September 30, 2023. The book value of investment securities (excluding unrealized gains and losses) of 4.60 billion at the end of the third quarter increased 57.4 million from December 31, 2023 and increased 97.1 million from September 30, 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company purchased 128.8 million of government agency mortgage-backed securities with an average yield of 5.62 , which the Company classified as held-to-maturity. The Company also participated in a Visa Class B share exchange during the second quarter of 2024, in which half of its Visa Class B shares were converted into Visa Class C shares that are convertible (with certain timing restrictions) to NYSE-traded Visa Class A shares, resulting in a 0.9 million unrealized gain on equity securities. These additions were offset by proceeds of 53.4 million from sales of tax-exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions available-for-sale investment securities, proceeds of 4.1 million from sales of taxable obligations of state and political subdivisions available-for-sale investment securities and 50.2 million of investment maturities, calls and principal payments during the first nine months of 2024. A realized loss of 0.5 million was recognized on the sales of tax-exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions available-for-sale investment securities during the first nine months of 2024. Additionally, there was 28.5 million of net accretion on investment securities during the first nine months of 2024. The effective duration of the investment securities portfolio was 6.4 years at the end of the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 7.0 years at the end of 2023 and 7.2 years at the end of the third quarter of 2023. The change in the carrying value of investment securities is also impacted by the amount of net unrealized gains or losses. At September 30, 2024, the investment portfolio (excluding held-to-maturity investment securities) had a 315.9 million net unrealized loss, as compared to a 380.7 million net unrealized loss at December 31, 2023 and a 546.4 million net unrealized loss at September 30, 2023. These changes in the net unrealized position of the portfolio were principally driven by the movements in medium to long-term interest rates, as well as the volume and rates associated with the securities purchases, sales and maturities that have occurred over the past 12 months.

 Loans Loans ended the third quarter at 10.25 billion, 547.1 million, or 5.6 , higher than December 31, 2023 ending loans and 801.6 million, or 8.5 , higher than the September 30, 2023 balance. Mortgages on commercial property combined with general-purpose business lending to commercial, industrial, non-profit and municipal customers and vehicle dealer floor plan financing is characterized as the Company s business lending activity. The business lending portfolio increased 476.7 million, or 12.2 , from September 30, 2023, and 307.2 million, or 7.5 , from December 31, 2023, driven by net organic growth over both periods. Business non-real estate loans, including commercial and industrial lending, increased 94.1 million, or 9.4 , owner-occupied commercial real estate increased 117.4 million, or 15.6 , multifamily increased 75.0 million, or 12.1 , and non-owner occupied commercial real estate increased 20.7 million, or 1.2 , as compared to December 31, 2023. While certain macroeconomic concerns are persisting related to non-owner occupied and multifamily commercial real estate and construction loans, the Company s exposure to these portfolios remains diverse both geographically and by property type, and remains relatively low at 15 of total assets, 24 of total loans and 199 of total bank-level regulatory capital. Commercial real estate lending represents 75.1 of the total business lending portfolio at September 30, 2024 while other business lending, including commercial and industrial loans represents the remaining 24.9 of total business lending. The Company s largest non-owner occupied commercial real estate lending concentration by property type is multifamily at 21.1 of total commercial real estate lending, followed by office at 11.3 and commercial construction, at 10.5 . The Company s largest owner-occupied commercial real estate lending concentration by industry is retail trade at 9.0 of total commercial real estate lending, followed by arts, entertainment and recreation and health care and social assistance, both at 2.7 . These levels demonstrate the Company s diversity in the business lending portfolio, as there are no significant industry or geographic concentrations, no metropolitan statistical area MSA that accounts for more than 13 of the CRE portfolio and a very low level of commercial real estate lending being conducted in major metropolitan areas. See Table 7 below for concentrations of CRE lending by borrower type and Table 8 below for concentrations of CRE by property location. The business loan balance increases are reflective of continued high demand for multi-family housing, expansion of internal resources and proactive business development and pricing in the Company s market areas, as well as the Company s strong liquidity profile relative to competitors that creates opportunities to gain market share. The Company strives to generate growth in its business portfolio in a manner that adheres to its goals of maintaining strong asset quality and producing profitable margins. The Company expects the composition of its growth in its business lending portfolio over the remaining quarter of 2024 to be proportionally higher for business non-real estate lending than commercial real estate lending compared to what was experienced by the Company over the past several years, in order to keep the concentration of its CRE portfolio relatively constant. The Company continues to invest in additional personnel, technology and business development resources to further strengthen its capabilities in this important product category. To assist our business lending customers in managing their interest rate risk, the Company enters into interest rate swaps which have associated interest rate and credit risk; for additional detail on the Company s use of interest rate swaps, see Note L beginning on page 35 of this Form 10-Q.

 (1) The MSAs within these captions are individually less than 2 of total CRE exposure. (2) The MSAs within these captions include certain counties in adjacent states with a high degree of economic and social integration to the respective core city in New York or Pennsylvania. Consumer mortgages increased 230.6 million, or 7.2 , from one year ago and increased 142.3 million, or 4.3 , from December 31, 2023, with the increases over both periods representing net organic growth and included the impact of certain secondary market sales. The Company sold 27.4 million and 39.9 million of consumer mortgage production during the three and nine months ended 2024, respectively. Over the past year, the Company produced organic growth in the consumer mortgage segment due to the Company s competitive product offerings, recruitment of additional mortgage loan originators and proactive business development efforts, while also benefitting from the comparatively stable housing market conditions in the Company s primary markets relative to the national environment. Reflective of the higher interest rate environment and consumer expectations of future interest rate movements, the consumer mortgage growth produced over the last quarter is comprised of a higher proportion of adjustable rate loans than experienced in recent periods. During the first nine months of 2024, approximately 21 of new consumer mortgage loan originations was comprised of adjustable rate loans compared to approximately 7 over the first nine months of 2023. The Company expects this trend to continue during the remainder of 2024. Home equity loans increased 16.2 million, or 3.6 , from one year ago and increased 14.4 million, or 3.2 , from December 31, 2023, in part a result of lower levels of payoffs and paydowns related to consumer mortgage refinancing in the higher interest rate environment. Consumer installment loans, both those originated directly in the branches and online (referred to as consumer direct and indirectly in automobile, marine and recreational vehicle dealerships (referred to as consumer indirect ), increased 78.2 million, or 4.1 , from one year ago, and increased 83.1 million, or 4.4 , from December 31, 2023. The increases were primarily due to the Company offering competitive pricing, benefitting from reduced participation by certain competitors and capturing an increased share of the sales volumes that existed in its market area and dealer network, which resulted in growth in the Company s consumer installment portfolio. Although the consumer indirect loan market is highly competitive, the Company is focused on maintaining a profitable in-market and contiguous market indirect portfolio, while continuing to pursue the expansion of its dealer network. Consumer direct loans have provided a key source of credit to the Company s retail customers across its branch network for an extended period of time, and the Company is committed to continuing to offer competitive loan products in this segment. Despite the strong competition the Company faces from the financing subsidiaries of vehicle manufacturers and other financial intermediaries, the Company will continue to strive to grow these key portfolios through varying market conditions over the long term.

 Asset Quality The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses by loan category as of the end of the periods indicated, as well as the proportional share of each category s loan balance to total loans. This allocation is based on management s assessment, as of a given point in time, of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to change when the risk factors of each component part change. The allocation is not indicative of the specific amount of future net charge-offs that is expected to be incurred in each of the loan categories, nor should it be taken as an indicator of future loss trends. The allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category. As shown in Table 9, total allowance for credit losses at the end of the third quarter was 76.2 million, an increase of 11.2 million, or 17.3 , from one year earlier and up 9.5 million, or 14.2 , from the end of 2023.

The unallocated allowance is maintained for potential inherent losses in the specific portfolios that are not captured due to model imprecision. The unallocated allowance of 1.0 million at September 30, 2024 was consistent with December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. The changes in allowance allocations reflect management s continued refinement of its loss estimation techniques. Management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable. Allowance for credit losses and loan net charge-off ratios are as follows: Table 10: Loan Ratios

 Net charge-offs during the third quarter of 2024 were 2.8 million, an increase of 1.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Compared with the third quarter of 2023, all loan portfolios experienced higher levels of net charge-offs. The total net charge-off ratio (net charge-offs annualized as a percentage of average loans outstanding for the quarter) for the third quarter was 0.11 , one basis point higher than the ratio for the fourth quarter of 2023 and six basis points higher than the ratio for the third quarter of 2023. Net charge-off ratios for the third quarter of 2024 for all loan portfolios were above the Company s average for the trailing eight quarters. Other real estate owned OREO at September 30, 2024 was 2.3 million. This compares to 1.2 million at December 31, 2023 and 0.6 million at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, OREO consisted of 34 residential properties with a total value of 2.3 million. This compares to 21 residential properties with a total value of 1.1 million and one commercial property with a value of 0.1 million at December 31, 2023, and 10 residential properties with a total value of 0.6 million at September 30, 2023. The increase in OREO over the last twelve months was primarily driven by the Company working through a backlog of residential foreclosures that arose due to pandemic-related moratoriums that have since been lifted. Approximately 49 of the nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024 were related to the business lending portfolio, which is comprised of business loans broadly diversified by industry and property type. Of the nonperforming loans in the business lending portfolio, non-owner occupied commercial real estate represents 40 of the balance, owner-occupied commercial real estate represents 33 of the balance, other commercial and industrial loans represents 26 of the balance, and multifamily represents the remaining 1 of the balance. The level of nonperforming business loans increased from the prior year primarily due to changes in the financial conditions and loan repayment performance of five business lending relationships, including one business lending relationship with total loan balances of 14.5 million, that were individually assessed for a specific allocation of the allowance for credit losses. Approximately 46 of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024 were comprised of consumer mortgages. Collateral values of residential properties within most of the Company s market areas have generally remained stable or increased over the past several years. Although high levels of inflation has had some adverse impact on consumers, the unemployment rate remains low and this has contributed to the credit performance in the consumer mortgage loan portfolio remaining favorable. The remaining 5 of nonperforming loans relate to consumer installment and home equity loans, with home equity nonperforming loan levels being driven by the same factors that were identified for consumer mortgages. The allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans ratio, a general measure of coverage adequacy, was 121 at the end of the third quarter, as compared to 122 at year-end 2023 and 176 at September 30, 2023. The decrease in this ratio versus one year ago was due to nonperforming loans increasing proportionally more than the allowance for credit losses, primarily driven by the aforementioned increase in a limited number of nonperforming business loans. The Company s senior management, special asset officers and business lending management review all delinquent and nonaccrual loans and OREO regularly in order to identify deteriorating situations, monitor known problem credits and discuss any needed changes to collection efforts, if warranted. Based on this analysis, a relationship may be assigned a special assets officer or other senior lending officer to review the loan, meet with the borrowers, assess the collateral and recommend an action plan. This plan could include foreclosure, restructuring loans, issuing demand letters or other actions. The Company s larger criticized credits are also reviewed on a quarterly basis by senior management, senior credit administration management, special assets officers and business lending management to monitor their status and discuss relationship management plans. Business lending management reviews the criticized business loan portfolio on a monthly basis. Delinquent loans (defined as loans 30 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status) as a percent of total loans was 1.07 at the end of the third quarter, one basis point above the 1.06 level at year-end 2023 and 17 basis points above the 0.90 level at September 30, 2023. The business lending delinquency ratio at the end of the third quarter of 0.74 was 13 basis points above the level of 0.61 at December 31, 2023 and 25 basis points above the level of 0.49 at September 30, 2023. The delinquency rates for all loan portfolios except for business lending and consumer mortgage decreased as compared to the levels at December 31, 2023. The delinquency rates for all loan portfolios except for home equity increased as compared to the levels at September 30, 2023.

 The Company recorded a 7.7 million provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024. The third quarter provision for credit losses was 4.8 million higher than the equivalent prior year period s provision for credit losses of 2.9 million. The allowance for credit losses of 76.2 million as of September 30, 2024 increased 11.2 million from one year ago. The current quarter provision for credit losses is reflective of a slight adverse movement in certain asset quality metrics, an increase in loan balances and continued macroeconomic uncertainty primarily concerning the business lending and consumer indirect portfolios. The allowance for credit losses to total loans ratio was 0.74 at September 30, 2024, five basis points higher than the levels at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. Refer to Note E: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of management s methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses. As of September 30, 2024, the net purchase discount related to the 934.7 million of remaining non-purchased credit deteriorated PCD loan balances acquired through prior period acquisition transactions was approximately 18.3 million, or 2.0 of that portfolio. Deposits As shown in Table 11, average deposits of 13.15 billion in the third quarter were 376.5 million, or 2.9 , higher than the third quarter of 2023 and increased 175.3 million, or 1.4 , from the fourth quarter of last year. On an ending basis, total deposits increased 548.1 million, or 4.2 , from December 31, 2023 and were 445.4 million, or 3.4 , higher than one year prior, primarily driven by higher municipal deposit balances. The mix of average deposit balances changed as the weighting of non-maturity deposits (noninterest checking, interest checking, savings and money markets) to total deposits has decreased from the prior year levels. Average noninterest checking deposits as a percentage of average total deposits was 27.5 in the third quarter compared to 29.8 in the third quarter of 2023 and 28.6 in the fourth quarter of last year. Average non-maturity deposits represented 84.2 of the Company s average deposit funding base in the third quarter of 2024, while time deposits represented 15.8 of total average deposits. In comparison, time deposits represented 10.8 of total average deposits during the third quarter of 2023 and 12.3 of total average deposits during the fourth quarter of last year, due in part to customers responding to changes in market interest rates by moving funds into higher yielding time deposit accounts. The quarterly average cost of deposits was 1.23 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 0.76 in the third quarter of 2023, reflective of the increase in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits in response to market conditions, as well as a decline in the proportion of noninterest and low-rate deposit balances. The quarterly average cost of deposits was consistent with the second quarter of 2024 as funding cost pressures slowed in concert with the modest declines in short-term market interest rates during the current quarter. The Company continues to focus on expanding its deposit relationship base through its competitive product offerings and high-quality customer service. The Company s deposit base is well diversified across customer segments, which as of September 30, 2024 is comprised of approximately 58 consumer, 27 business and 15 municipal. The Company s deposit base is also broadly dispersed with an average consumer deposit balance per account of approximately 12,000 and average business deposit relationship of approximately 71,000, while the Company s total average deposit balance per account is under 20,000. In addition, at the end of the quarter, 65 of the Company s total deposit balances were in checking and low-rate savings accounts and the weighted-average age of the Company s non-maturity deposit accounts was approximately 15 years. The total estimated amount of deposits that exceeded the 250,000 insured limit provided by the FDIC, net of collateralized and intercompany deposits, was approximately 2.26 billion at September 30, 2024. This amount is determined by adjusting the amounts reported in the Bank Call Report by intercompany deposits, which are not external customers and are therefore eliminated in consolidation, and municipal deposits whose uninsured balances are collateralized by certain pledged investment securities. The Bank Call Report estimated uninsured deposit balances at September 30, 2024 are reported gross at 4.55 billion, which includes intercompany account balances of 404.9 million, and collateralized deposits of 1.88 billion. Estimated insured deposits, net of collateralized and intercompany deposits, represent greater than 80 of ending total deposits at September 30, 2024. These estimates are based on the determination of known deposit account balances of each depositor and the insurance guidelines provided by the FDIC. Average non-municipal deposits for the third quarter of 2024 increased 87.2 million versus the fourth quarter of 2023 and increased 0.4 million versus the year-earlier period, primarily due to increases in time deposits as customers move to higher yielding deposit products. Average municipal deposits for the third quarter increased 88.0 million, or 5.4 , from the fourth quarter of 2023 and 376.2 million, or 27.7 , from the third quarter of 2023, reflective of seasonal inflows of municipal deposit balances as well as competitive offerings and expansion of the Company s municipal deposit relationship base due in part to additional business development efforts. Average municipal deposits as a percentage of total average deposits increased from 10.6 in the third quarter of 2023 to 13.2 in the third quarter of 2024.

This was 170.4 million higher than borrowings at December 31, 2023 and 314.1 million above the level at the end of the third quarter of 2023. The increase from the prior year third quarter was primarily due to an increase in other FHLB borrowings of 305.4 million, as the Company secured fixed rate FHLB term borrowings to support the funding of continued loan growth that was not covered by increases in deposit balances. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily related to additional FHLB term borrowings being secured during the current year to date and 8.7 million of finance lease liabilities commencing in the third quarter of 2024 in connection with the Company s de novo branch expansions, partially offset by a decrease in overnight borrowings of 53.0 million. During January 2024, the Company secured 300.0 million in short-term borrowings through the Federal Reserve s Bank Term Funding Program at a rate of 4.87 to fund expected net loan growth. These short-term borrowings matured during March 2024 and the Bank Term Funding Program has ceased making new loans as of March 11, 2024. During June 2024, three 50.0 million putable advances were executed with the FHLB for a total of 150.0 million in new term borrowings. The advances are putable at the option of the FHLB in June 2025 and mature in June 2027 if the option is not exercised, at interest rates ranging from 4.38 to 4.47 . During August 2024, a 100.0 million fixed rate putable advance was executed with the FHLB at a rate of 3.73 . The advance is putable at the option of the FHLB in August 2025 and matures in August 2027 if the option is not exercised. Securities sold under agreement to repurchase, also referred to as customer repurchase agreements, represent collateralized municipal and commercial funding from customers that price and operate similar to a deposit instrument. Customer repurchase agreements totaled 317.4 million at the end of the third quarter of 2024, 12.9 million higher than December 31, 2023, due primarily to the seasonal characteristics of this portfolio, and 12.8 million lower than September 30, 2023. Shareholders Equity and Regulatory Capital Total shareholders equity of 1.78 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2024 represents an increase of 87.0 million, or 5.1 , from the balance at December 31, 2023. The increase was driven by net income of 132.7 million, a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 62.9 million, stock-based compensation of 6.5 million and net activity under the Company s employee stock plans of 2.7 million, partially offset by common stock repurchased of 45.8 million and common stock dividends declared of 71.8 million. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss was comprised of 61.9 million of other comprehensive gain related to the Company s investment securities portfolio, including a net increase in the after-tax market value adjustment on the available-for-sale investment portfolio as medium and long-term market interest rates decreased, and 1.0 million of other comprehensive income associated with adjustments to the overfunded status of the Company s employee retirement plans. Over the past 12 months, total shareholders equity increased 230.0 million, or 14.8 , as net income, the issuance of common stock in association with the employee stock plans, adjustments to the overfunded status of the Company s employee retirement plans and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the Company s investment securities portfolio more than offset common stock dividends declared and common stock repurchase activity.

 The dividend payout ratio (dividends declared divided by net income) for the first nine months of 2024 was 54.1 , compared to 72.8 for the first nine months of 2023. Excluding the after-tax impact of the loss on sales of investment securities, the dividend payout ratio for the first nine months of 2023 was 51.3 . Third quarter dividends declared increased 0.8 versus one year earlier, as the Company s quarterly dividend per share was raised from 0.44 to 0.45 in the third quarter of 2023, and from 0.45 to 0.46 in the third quarter of 2024, while total shares outstanding decreased 1.6 as common stock repurchases outweighed issuances from the Company s employee stock plans. The one cent, or 2.2 , increase in the quarterly dividend to 0.46 per share on the Company s common stock declared in the third of quarter of 2024 marked the 32nd consecutive year of dividend increases. The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s dividend paying ability and financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action PCA ), the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital ratio guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company s and the Bank s assets and certain liabilities and off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company s and the Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about the treatment of capital components, the risk weightings of assets and other factors. The Company and the Bank are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer CCB ), composed entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital, in addition to capital sufficient to meet minimum risk-based capital ratios. The required capital conservation buffer was 2.5 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Therefore, to satisfy both the PCA adequately capitalized minimum risk-based capital ratios and the CCB as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company and the Bank must maintain: (i) Common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets Common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 7.0 , (ii) Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.5 , and (iii) Total capital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to total risk-weighted assets Total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.5 . 
 In addition, the Company and Bank must maintain a ratio of ending Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (not subject to CCB requirements). As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company and Bank met all applicable capital adequacy requirements to be considered well capitalized . As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the regulatory capital ratios for the Company and Bank are presented below. Table 12: Regulatory Ratios

The decrease in the Tier 1 leverage ratio in comparison to December 31, 2023 was the result of an increase in average assets, excluding intangibles and the market value adjustment on available-for-sale investment securities, of 3.8 , primarily due to organic loan growth, while ending shareholders equity, excluding intangibles and other comprehensive income or loss items, increased 1.4 , reflecting heightened level of share repurchases in the first half of 2024. The Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased compared to the prior year s third quarter as average assets, excluding intangibles and the market value adjustment, increased 5.9 primarily due to organic loan growth, while shareholders equity, excluding intangibles and other comprehensive income or loss items, increased 2.3 as the impact of net earnings retention outweighed share repurchases.

 The shareholders equity-to-assets ratio was 10.88 at the end of the third quarter of 2024 compared to 10.92 at December 31, 2023 and 10.11 at September 30, 2023. The tangible equity-to-tangible assets ratio, a non-GAAP measure, of 5.97 increased 0.22 percentage points from December 31, 2023 and increased 1.16 percentage points versus September 30, 2023 (see Table 14 for Reconciliation of Quarterly GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures). The increase in the tangible equity-to-tangible assets ratio, a non-GAAP measure, from one year prior was driven by a 230.0 million, or 32.9 , increase in tangible equity, a non-GAAP measure, as net income retention (net income minus dividends declared) and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily associated with the investment securities portfolio outweighed the impact of share repurchases between the periods, while tangible assets, a non-GAAP measure, increased 1.02 billion, or 7.0 , due primarily to organic loan growth. The increase in the tangible equity-to-tangible assets ratio, a non-GAAP measure, from December 31, 2023 was driven by an increase in tangible equity, a non-GAAP measure, of 83.0 million, or 9.8 , as net income retention and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily associated with the investment securities portfolio outweighed the impact of share repurchases between the periods, while tangible assets, a non-GAAP measure, increased 844.9 million, or 5.7 , primarily due to organic loan growth. Liquidity Liquidity risk is a measure of the Company s ability to raise cash when needed at a reasonable cost and minimize any loss. The Company maintains appropriate liquidity levels in both normal operating conditions as well as stressed environments. The Company must be capable of meeting all obligations to its customers at any time and, therefore, the active management of its liquidity position remains an important management objective. The Bank has appointed the Asset Liability Committee ALCO to manage liquidity risk using policy guidelines and limits on indicators of potential liquidity risk. The indicators are monitored using a scorecard with three risk level limits. These risk indicators measure core liquidity and funding needs, capital at risk and change in available funding sources. The risk indicators are monitored using such metrics as the core basic surplus ratio, unencumbered securities to average assets, free loan collateral to average assets, loans to deposits, deposits to total funding and borrowings to total funding ratios. Given the uncertain nature of the Company s customers demands, as well as the Company s desire to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities, the Company must have adequate sources of on and off-balance sheet funds available that can be utilized when needed. Accordingly, in addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cash flows, liquidity must be supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines from correspondent banks and borrowings from the FHLB and the FRB. Other funding alternatives may also be appropriate from time to time, including wholesale and retail repurchase agreements, large certificates of deposit and the brokered CD market. The primary sources of funds are deposits, which totaled 13.48 billion at September 30, 2024. The primary sources of non-deposit funds are customer repurchase agreements, and FHLB and FRB overnight advances and term borrowings. At September 30, 2024, there were 317.4 million of customer repurchase agreements, no overnight borrowings, and 622.3 million of FHLB term borrowings outstanding. The Company s primary sources of available liquidity include unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity at the FHLB and FRB, as well as net unpledged investment securities that could be sold, subject to market conditions, or used to collateralize additional funding. Table 13 below details the available sources of liquidity at September 30, 2024. In addition, there was 25.0 million available in an unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank at September 30, 2024. The Company s sources of immediately available liquidity of 4.50 billion as of September 30, 2024 represent nearly 200 of the Company s estimated uninsured deposits (deposits in excess of FDIC limits), net of collateralized and intercompany deposits net estimated uninsured deposits ), estimated to be approximately 2.26 billion. During October 2024, the Company pledged additional loans with the FRB which increased its total sources of available liquidity by approximately 1.45 billion.

September 30, December 31, (000 s omitted) 2024 2023 Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 341,001 190,962 FHLB borrowing capacity 1,272,973 1,370,085 FRB borrowing capacity 1,191,235 1,106,806 Net unpledged investment securities 1,691,165 2,165,590 Total sources of liquidity 4,496,374 4,833,443 Net estimated uninsured deposits 2,263,747 2,184,635 Total sources of liquidity/net estimated uninsured deposits 199 221 The Company s primary approach to measuring short-term liquidity is known as the Basic Surplus/Deficit model. It is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods: first, the amount of cash that could be made available within 30 days (calculated as liquid assets less short-term liabilities as a percentage of average assets); and second, a projection of subsequent cash availability over an additional 60 days. As of September 30, 2024, this ratio was 9.0 for 30-days and 8.4 for 90-days, excluding the Company s capacity to borrow additional funds from the FHLB and other sources. This is considered to be a sufficient amount of liquidity based on the Company s internal policy requirement of 7.5 . To measure intermediate risk over the next twelve months, the Company reviews a sources and uses projection. As of September 30, 2024, there is sufficient liquidity available during the next year to cover projected cash outflows. In addition, stress tests on the cash flows are performed for various scenarios ranging from high probability events with a low impact on the liquidity position to low probability events with a high impact on the liquidity position. The results of the stress tests as of September 30, 2024 indicate the Company has sufficient sources of liquidity for the next year in all simulated stressed scenarios. To measure longer-term liquidity, a baseline projection of growth in interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for five years is made to reflect how liquidity levels could change over time. This five-year measure reflects ample liquidity for loan and other asset growth over the next five years. The possibility of a funding crisis exists at all financial institutions. A funding crisis would most likely result from a shock to the financial system which disrupts orderly short-term funding operations or from a significant tightening of monetary policy that limits the national money supply. Accordingly, management has addressed this issue by formulating a Liquidity Contingency Plan, which has been reviewed and approved by both the Company s Board of Directors (the Board and the Company s ALCO. The plan addresses the actions that the Company would take in response to both a short-term and long-term funding crisis. Triggers within the plan and liquidity risk monitor are not by themselves definitive indicators of insufficient liquidity, but rather a mechanism for management to monitor conditions and possibly provide advance warning which could avert or reduce the impact of a crisis. Liquidity triggers are set based on a variety of factors, including Company history, trends, and current operating performance, industry observations, and, as warranted, changes in internal and external economic factors. Indicators include: core liquidity and funding needs such as the core basic surplus, unencumbered securities to average assets, and free FHLB and FRB loan collateral to average assets; heightened funding needs indicators such as average loans to average deposits, average municipal and nonmunicipal deposits to total funding, and average borrowings to total funding; capital at risk indicators including regulatory ratios; asset quality indicators; and decrease in funds availability indicators which are a combination of internal and external factors such as increased restrictions on borrowing or downturns in the credit market. The Company has established three risk levels for these liquidity triggers that inform the response based on the severity of the circumstances. Responses vary from an assessment of possible funding deficiencies with no impact on normal business operations to immediate action required due to impending funding problems. For more information regarding the risk factor associated with the possibility of a funding crisis, refer to the discussion under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates, prices or credit risk. Credit risk associated with the Company s loan portfolio has been previously discussed in the asset quality section of the MD A. Management believes that the tax risk of the Company s municipal investments associated with potential future changes in statutory, judicial and regulatory actions is minimal. Treasury, agency, mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligation securities issued by government agencies comprise 90.3 of the total portfolio and are currently rated AAA by Moody s Investor Services and AA+ by Standard Poor s. Obligations of state and political subdivisions account for 9.5 of the total portfolio, of which 95.7 carry a minimum rating of A-. The remaining 0.2 of the portfolio is comprised of other investment grade securities. The Company does not have material foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure. Therefore, almost all the market risk in the investment portfolio is related to interest rates.

 The ongoing monitoring and management of both interest rate risk and liquidity over the short and long term time horizons is an important component of the Company s asset/liability management process, which is governed by guidelines established in the policies reviewed and approved annually by the Company s Board. The Board delegates responsibility for carrying out the policies to the ALCO, which meets each month. The committee is made up of the Company s senior management, corporate finance and risk personnel as well as regional and line-of-business managers who oversee specific earning asset classes and various funding sources. As the Company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements, it has maintained an appropriate process and set of measurement tools, which enables it to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk in varying rate environments. The primary tool used by the Company in managing interest rate risk is income simulation. This begins with the development of a base case scenario, which projects net interest income NII over the next twelve month period. The base case scenario NII may increase or decrease significantly from quarter to quarter reflective of changes during the most recent quarter in the Company s: (i) earning assets and liabilities balances, (ii) composition of earning assets and liabilities, (iii) earning asset yields, (iv) cost of funds and (v) various model assumptions including loan and time deposit spreads and core deposit betas, as well as current market interest rates, including the slope of the yield curve and projected changes in the slope of the yield curve over the twelve month period. The direction of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, the modeled changes in deposit balances and the cost of funds, including the Company s deposit and funding betas, are not easily predicted in the current market environment, and therefore a wide variety of strategic balance sheet and treasury yield curve scenarios are modeled on an ongoing basis. The following reflects the Company s estimated NII sensitivity as compared to the base case scenario over the subsequent twelve months based on: Balance sheet levels using September 30, 2024 as a starting point. The model assumes the Company s average deposit balances will decrease approximately 0.4 over the next twelve months. The model assumes the Company s average earning asset balances will increase approximately 2.3 over the next twelve months, largely due to forecasted loan growth. Cash flows on earning assets are based on contractual maturity, optionality, and amortization schedules along with applicable prepayments derived from internal historical data and external sources. The model assumes no additional investment security purchases over the next twelve months. Investment cash inflows will be used to pay down overnight borrowings and fund loan growth. In the rising/falling rates scenarios, the prime rate, federal funds, and treasury curve rates are assumed to move up/down in a parallel manner by the amounts listed below over a 12-month period. Deposit balance and mix changes and the resultant deposit and funding betas are assumed to move in a manner that reflects the Company s (i) long-term historical relationship between the Company s deposit rate movement and changes in the federal funds rate, (ii) recent interest rate cycle experience, (iii) significant management judgment and (iv) other factors, including recent market behaviors of customers and competitors.

Projected NII increases in the down 100 and down 200 rate environments due to lower funding costs which are partially offset by lower income on loans.

 The analysis does not represent a Company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results. These hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions: the nature and timing of interest rate levels (including yield curve shape), prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows, and other factors. While the assumptions are developed based upon a reasonable outlook for national and local economic and market conditions, the Company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive efficacy of these assumptions, including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that the ALCO might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates and other developments. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a -15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act ), designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on management s evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, it has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company regularly assesses the adequacy of its internal controls over financial reporting. There have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation referenced in the paragraph above that occurred during the Company s quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Part II. Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings or other matters in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. Information on current legal proceedings and other matters is set forth in Note J to the consolidated financial statements included under Part I, Item 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors There has not been any material change in the risk factors disclosure from that contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.
