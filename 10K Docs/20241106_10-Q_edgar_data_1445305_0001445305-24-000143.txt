 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created thereby. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than statements of historical facts, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words believe, may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, in Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in any subsequent filing we make with the SEC, as well as in any documents incorporated by reference that describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. 
 Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. 
 Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, achievements or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. We are under no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after completion of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations.

 Seasonality affects our revenue, expenses and cash flows from operations. Revenue from professional services is generally higher in the first quarter as many of our customers file their 10-K in the first calendar quarter. Our sales and marketing expense also has some degree of seasonality. Sales and marketing expenses have historically been higher in the third quarter due to our annual user conference in September. In addition, the timing of cash bonus payments to employees during the first and fourth calendar quarters may result in some seasonality in operating cash flow. The condensed consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in this report and the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024. 
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Workiva Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

 August 2023 August 15, 2028 May 15, 2028 August 21, 2026 7.4690 
 In August 2019, we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2026 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase an additional million principal amount (the "2026 Notes ). The 2026 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2020. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes totaled million, net of initial purchaser discounts and issuance costs. 
 In August 2023, we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2028 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including the partial exercise of million principal amount by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase up to an additional million principal amount (the "2028 Notes ). The 2028 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2024. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Notes totaled million, net of initial purchaser discounts and issuance costs. 
 The 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes are together referred to as the "Notes". 
 The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture and are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company. The 2028 Notes will rank equally with all of the Company s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, including the Company s outstanding 2026 Notes. 
 Holders of the Notes may convert all or a portion of their Notes prior to the close of business on their respective Free Convertibility dates, in multiples of 1,000 principal amount, only under the following circumstances: 
 during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter in which the respective Notes were issued (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock, par value per share, for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including,

 of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; 
 during the consecutive business day period immediately following any consecutive trading day period (the measurement period in which the trading price (as defined below) per 1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; 
 if we call any or all of the Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or 
 upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate events as set forth in the relevant indenture. 
 On or after the relevant Free Convertibility Date, holders of the Notes may convert their Notes at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Notes. 
 Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at our election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the indenture. 
 The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at its option, on or after the respective Redemption Date, if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock has been at least of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the respective Redemption Date. 
 During the third quarter of 2024 none of the conversion conditions were met and therefore the Notes are not convertible at the option of the holders. As a result, the Notes were classified as non-current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 
 Interest expense representing the amortization of issuance costs as well as contractual interest expense is amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of and over the term of the 2026 Notes and 2028 Notes, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the remaining life of the 2026 Notes and 2028 Notes were approximately years and years, respectively.

 million net of cash acquired of million to launch Workiva Carbon. Workiva Carbon is an audit-ready carbon accounting solution that helps organizations measure, manage, track, and report carbon emissions, including data from third-party supply chain partners. Coupled with Workiva's ESG reporting solution, companies can now collect key business data, calculate critical metrics, set data-driven ESG strategy, measure progress, and report results all in the Workiva platform. 
 The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The fair values of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets acquired in the acquisition were externally estimated primarily based on the replacement cost approach. The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may change over the measurement period as additional information is received. The primary area subject to change includes our review of the valuation of intangible assets. We expect to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The goodwill recognized was primarily attributable to the assembled workforce, operational synergies, and strategic benefits that are expected to be achieved and is not deductible for income tax purposes.

 We have achieved significant revenue growth in recent periods. Our revenue grew to 185.6 million and 538.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively from 158.2 million and 463.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We incurred net losses of 17.0 million and 46.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively compared to 56.3 million and 123.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 We continue to invest for future growth and are focused on several key drivers, including focusing on multi-solution adoption by new and existing customers, further developing our partner program, accelerating international expansion and our fit-for-purpose solutions. These growth drivers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses. 
 Recent Business Developments 
 On June 17, 2024, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in Sustain.Life, a leading provider of carbon accounting solutions, to launch Workiva Carbon. Workiva Carbon is an audit-ready carbon accounting solution that helps organizations measure, manage, track, and report carbon emissions, including data from third-party supply chain partners. Coupled with Workiva's ESG reporting solution, companies can now collect key business data, calculate critical metrics, set data-driven ESG strategy, measure progress, and report results all in the Workiva platform. See Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. 
 Effects of Volatility in the IPO/SPAC Markets 
 In the United States, volatility in the public markets has led to a decrease in the number of initial public offerings IPOs and special-purpose acquisition companies SPACs since fiscal year 2022. New sales of our SEC and capital markets solutions were adversely affected by this decline in the IPO and SPAC markets. We expect reduced valuation multiples caused by higher interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical instability to continue to negatively impact the number of IPOs and SPACs in fiscal year 2024. Whether and to what extent the IPO and SPAC markets will moderate cannot be accurately predicted. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Generate Growth From Existing Customers. The Workiva platform can exhibit a powerful network effect within an enterprise, meaning that the usefulness of our platform attracts additional users. Since solution-based licensing offers our customers an unlimited number of seats for each solution purchased, we expect customers to add more seats over time. As more employees in an enterprise use our platform, additional opportunities for collaboration and automation drive demand among their colleagues for additional solutions. 
 Pursue New Customers . We sell to organizations that manage large, complex processes with distributed teams of contributors and disparate sets of business data. We market our platform to professionals and executives in the areas of financial and non-financial reporting, including regulatory, multi-entity and performance reporting. In addition, we market to teams responsible for ESG reporting, and GRC programs. We intend to continue to build our sales and marketing organization and leverage our brand equity to attract new customers.

 Offer More Solutions. We intend to introduce new solutions to continue to meet growing demand for our platform. Our close and trusted relationships with our customers are a source for new use cases, features and solutions. We have a disciplined process for tracking, developing and releasing new solutions that are designed to have immediate, broad applicability; a strong value proposition; and a high return on investment for both Workiva and our customers. Our advance planning team assesses customer needs, conducts industry-based research and defines new markets. This vetting process involves our sales, product marketing, customer success, professional services, research and development, finance and senior management teams. 
 Expand Across Enterprises. Our success in delivering multiple solutions has created demand from customers for a broader-based, enterprise-wide Workiva platform. In response, we have been improving our technology and realigning sales and marketing to capitalize on our growing enterprise-wide opportunities. We believe this expansion will add seats and revenue and continue to support our high revenue retention rates. However, we expect that enterprise-wide deals will be larger and more complex, which tend to lengthen the sales cycle. 
 Add Partners. We continue to expand and deepen our relationships with global and regional partners, including consulting firms, system integrators, large and mid-sized independent software vendors, and implementation partners. Our advisory and service partners offer a wider range of domain and functional expertise that broadens our platform s capabilities and promotes Workiva as part of the digital transformation projects they drive for their customers. Our technology partners enable powerful data and process integrations to help customers connect critical transactional systems directly to our platform, with powerful linking, auditability and control features. We believe that our partner ecosystem extends our global reach, accelerates the usage and adoption of our platform, and enables more efficient delivery of professional services. 
 Investment in growth . We plan to continue to invest in the development of our platform, fit-for-purpose solutions and application marketplace to enhance our current offerings and build new features. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in our sales, marketing, professional services and customer success organizations to drive additional revenue and support the needs of our growing customer base and to take advantage of opportunities that we have identified in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia-Pacific ("APAC") regions. 
 Seasonality. Our revenue from professional services has some degree of seasonality. Many of our customers employ our professional services just before they file their Form 10-K, often in the first calendar quarter. Our sales and marketing expense also has some degree of seasonality. Sales and marketing expenses have historically been higher in the third quarter due to our annual user conference in September. In addition, the timing of the payments of cash bonuses to employees during the first and fourth calendar quarters may result in some seasonality in operating cash flow.

 Total customers . We believe total number of customers is a key indicator of our financial success and future revenue potential. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. Our customer is typically a parent company or, in a few cases, a significant subsidiary that works with us directly. Companies with publicly-listed securities account for a substantial majority of our customers. Our customer count as of September 30, 2024 does not include Sustain.Life. 
 Subscription and support revenue retention rate . We calculate our subscription and support revenue retention rate based on all customers that were active at the end of the same calendar quarter of the prior year base customers ). We begin by annualizing the subscription and support revenue recorded in the same calendar quarter of the prior year for those base customers who are still active at the end of the current quarter. We divide the result by the annualized subscription and support revenue in the same quarter of the prior year for all base customers. 
 Our subscription and support revenue retention rate was 97.5 as of September 30, 2024, down slightly from 97.7 as of September 30, 2023. We believe that our success in maintaining a high rate of revenue retention is attributable primarily to our robust technology platform and strong customer service. Customers whose securities were deregistered due to merger or acquisition or financial distress accounted for over half of our revenue attrition in the latest quarter. 
 Subscription and support revenue retention rate including add-ons . Add-on revenue includes the change in both solutions and pricing for existing customers. We calculate our subscription and support revenue retention rate including add-ons by annualizing the subscription and support revenue recorded in the current quarter for our base customers that were active at the end of the current quarter. We divide the result by the annualized subscription and support revenue in the same quarter of the prior year for all base customers.

 Our subscription and support revenue retention rate including add-ons was 110.5 as of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, down from 112.0 as of September 30, 2023. 
 Annual contract value . Our annual contract value ACV for each customer is calculated by annualizing the subscription and support revenue recognized during each quarter. We believe the increase in the number of larger contracts shows our progress in expanding our customers adoption of our platform.

 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue through the sale of subscriptions to our cloud-based software and the delivery of professional services. We serve a wide range of customers in many industries, and our revenue is not concentrated with any single customer or small group of customers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no single customer represented more than 1 of our revenue, and our largest 10 customers accounted for less than 10 of our revenue in the aggregate. 
 We generate sales directly through our sales force and partners. We also identify some sales opportunities with existing customers through our customer success and professional services teams. 
 Our customer contracts typically range in length from one year to three years. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees annually in advance. For contracts with a two or three year term, customers sometimes elect to pay the entire multi-year subscription term in advance. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. 
 Subscription and Support Revenue . We recognize subscription and support revenue on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. Amounts that are invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue. 
 Professional Services Revenue . We believe our professional services facilitate the sale of our subscription service to certain customers. To date, most of our professional services have consisted of document set up, XBRL tagging, and consulting to help our customers with business processes and best practices for using our platform. Our professional services are not required for customers to utilize our solution. We recognize revenue for document set up when the service is complete and control has transferred to the customer. Revenues from XBRL tagging and consulting services are recognized as the services are performed.

 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased 4.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same quarter a year ago due primarily to a 0.9 million increase in cash-based compensation and benefits, 2.6 million of additional stock-based compensation, and a 0.8 million increase in recruiting and professional service fees. The increase in compensation was primarily due to additional performance-based restricted stock awards issued to executives in the latter part of the first quarter of 2024 and changes in the assumptions associated with the attainment of company-specific performance targets. The remaining increase in compensation was due to a modest increase in employee headcount. The increase in professional service fees was primarily due to costs incurred to acquire Sustain.Life. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 10.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period a year ago due primarily to a 12.2 million decrease in stock-based compensation partially offset by a 2.0 million increase in professional service fees. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a one-time benefit of 1.0 million related to a goods and services tax refund as well as one-time fees of 0.6 million related to the cancellation of certain events which did not recur in 2024. The decrease in compensation during the first nine months of 2024 is primarily due to the recognition of 1.4 million and 18.1 million in cash-based and stock-based compensation, respectively, pursuant to certain transition agreements with former executives during the first quarter of 2023 which did not recur in 2024, partially offset by a modest increase in employee headcount and an increase in performance-based restricted stock expense driven by additional performance-based restricted stock awards issued to executives in the latter part of the first quarter of 2024 and changes in the assumptions associated with the attainment of company-specific performance targets. The increase in professional service fees was primarily due to costs incurred to acquire Sustain.Life.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income increased 14.5 million compared to the same period a year ago due primarily to an increase in our investment balance, facilitated by the issuance of our 2028 convertible notes (the "2028 Notes"), coupled with higher interest rates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 45.1 million loss on induced conversion from the partial repurchase of our 2026 Notes, which did not recur in 2024 and contributed primarily to the decrease in interest expense compared to the same period a year ago. Other expense, net decreased 1.1 million compared to the same period a year ago due primarily to gains on foreign currency transactions as well as losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities from the first nine months of 2023 which did not recur in 2024. 
 Results of Operations for Fiscal 2023 Compared to 2022 
 For a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, see "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview of Sources and Uses of Cash 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 776.4 million, which were held for working capital purposes. We have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and issuances of convertible debt. We have generated significant operating losses as reflected in our accumulated deficit on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. While we expect to continue to incur operating losses and may incur negative cash flows from operations in the future, we believe that current cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. 
 Convertible Debt 
 In August 2023, we issued 702.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.250 2028 Notes. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Notes totaled 691.1 million, net of initial purchaser discounts and issuance costs. We used 396.9 million of the net proceeds from the 2028 Notes offering to repurchase 273.8 million principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, of our 1.125 2026 Notes in separate and individually negotiated transactions with certain holders. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding debt relating to our 2026 Notes and 2028 Notes of 70.7 million and 693.5 million, with corresponding maturity dates of August 15, 2026 and August 15, 2028, respectively. 
 Share Repurchase Plan 
 On July 30, 2024, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 100.0 million of our outstanding Class A common stock (the 2024 Repurchase Plan ). The repurchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or other available means, each in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. The timing, manner, price, and amount of the repurchase will be subject to the discretion of the Company s management, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of September 30, 2024, we have not made any repurchases under the 2024 Repurchase Plan.

 Operating Activities 
 Our largest source of operating cash is cash collections from customers for subscription and support access to our platform. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures, marketing activities, and costs of cloud infrastructure services. 
 Cash provided by operating activities of 18.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of a net loss of 17.0 million adjusted for non-cash charges of 28.5 million and net cash inflows of 7.4 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in deferred revenue which was due in part to an increase in large contracts signed in the period coupled with growth in our customer base. The increases in accounts receivable, other receivables, and accounts payable as well as the decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities were attributable primarily to the timing of cash payments and collections. 
 Cash provided by operating activities of 15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of a net loss of 56.3 million adjusted for non-cash charges of 65.7 million and net cash inflows of 5.5 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The adjustments for non-cash charges included a 45.1 million loss on induced conversion from the partial repurchase of our 2026 Notes. Customer growth and contract renewals for longer terms accounted for most of the increase in deferred revenue. Deferred costs decreased primarily due to the amortization of direct and incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract. The increases in accounts receivable, other receivables, and accrued expenses and other liabilities as well as the decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets were attributable primarily to the timing of our billings, cash collections, and cash payments. 
 Cash provided by operating activities of 43.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of a net loss of 46.2 million adjusted for non-cash charges of 75.9 million and net cash inflows of 14.0 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The adjustments for non-cash charges included a 45.1 million loss on induced conversion from the partial repurchase of our 2026 Notes. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in deferred revenue which was due in part to multi-year prepaid customer contracts coupled with growth in our customer base. The increase in deferred costs was primarily due to growth in subscription bookings. The increases in accounts receivable, other assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other liabilities as well as the decreases in other receivables and prepaid expenses were attributable primarily to the timing of our billings, cash collections, and cash payments.

Customer growth accounted for most of the increase in deferred revenue. Deferred costs decreased primarily due to the amortization of direct and incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract. The increases in other receivables, prepaid expenses, and accrued expenses and other liabilities as well as the decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable were attributable primarily to the timing of our billings, cash collections, and cash payments.

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 There were no material changes in our contractual obligations and commitments from those disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, income taxes and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as described in the financial statements contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our exposures to market risk have not changed materially since December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

 Part II. Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that in the opinion of our management, if determined adversely to us, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes during fiscal year 2024 to the risk factors that were included in the Form 10-K, other than what is set forth immediately below. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Securities 
 The amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate, and we cannot guarantee that we will fully consummate our share repurchase authorization, or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves. 
 The amount, frequency and execution of our share repurchases pursuant to the 2024 Repurchase Plan may fluctuate based on our operating results, cash flows, priorities for the use of cash for other purposes. These other purposes include, but are not limited to, operational spending, capital spending, acquisitions, and repayment of debt. Other factors, including changes in tax laws, could also impact our share repurchases. Although our board of directors has authorized share repurchases of up to 100.0 million of our outstanding Class A common stock, the authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any common stock, and we may not ultimately purchase any common stock. 
 We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase authorization pursuant to the 2024 Repurchase Plan will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. The repurchase authorization could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility. Price volatility may cause the average price at which we repurchase our common stock in a given period to exceed the common stock s price at a given point in time. There can be no assurance that the time frame for repurchases under our 2024 Repurchase Plan or that any repurchases will have a positive impact on our stock price or earnings per share. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue or decrease our stock repurchases include, among others, unfavorable market conditions, the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment or strategic opportunities presented to us from time to time and the availability of funds necessary to fulfill such repurchases.
