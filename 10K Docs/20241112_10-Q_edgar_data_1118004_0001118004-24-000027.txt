 The number of debt securities in an unrealized loss position decreased from at December 31, 2023 to at September 30, 2024. The unrealized losses shown above are due to increases in market rates over the yields available at the time of purchase of the underlying securities and not credit quality. The unrealized losses on debt securities have not been recognized into income because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity.

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 GAAP requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the balance sheet, that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions significantly affect the estimates and, as such, the derived fair value may not be indicative of the value negotiated in an actual sale and may not be comparable to that reported by other financial institutions. In addition, the fair value estimates are based on existing financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.

 Trust Preferred Securities 
 
 The Company also owns the outstanding common stock of business trusts that have issued preferred capital securities to third parties. Under a grandfathering provision in the Basel III capital rules that applies to bank holding companies with less than 15 billion in total consolidated assets, these preferred capital securities have qualified as Tier 1 capital for the Company, subject to regulatory rules and limits. These trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of the common stock and the preferred capital securities to purchase subordinated debentures issued by the Company. These subordinated debentures are these trusts only assets, and quarterly interest payments on these subordinated debentures are the sole source of cash for these trusts to pay quarterly distributions on the common stock and preferred capital securities. The Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the trusts obligations with respect to the preferred capital securities. 
 
 The Company has the right to defer the payment of interest on the subordinated debentures at any time, or from time to time, for periods not exceeding .

The subordinated debentures payable to statutory trusts vary from the amount carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 due to the remaining purchase discount of million, which was established upon the merger (the SCC Merger with State Capital Corp. SCC ), in which BancPlus acquired SCC, the holding company of State Bank Trust Company State Bank by a statutory share exchange and SCC was merged with and into BancPlus and State Bank was merged with and into BankPlus, with BancPlus and BankPlus surviving the mergers, which closed on April 1, 2020, and is being amortized over the remaining life of the debentures.

 of the next of an employee s salary deferral contributions in excess of . Additional contributions are made to the ESOP at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors. 
 The ESOP owned and shares of the Company's common stock at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The ESOP can enter into loans, collateralized by ESOP shares, with the Company in connection with the repurchase of shares of Company stock sold by participants in accordance with diversification provisions of the ESOP. These unallocated shares would be released to participants proportionately as the loans are repaid. Dividends on allocated shares are recorded as dividends and charged to retained earnings. Dividends on unallocated shares, if any, that are used to repay the loan would be treated as compensation expense. As of September 30, 2024, the ESOP had zero outstanding loans with the Company. 
 Distributions of the ESOP may be either in cash or Company common stock. The allocated shares are subject to a put option, whereby the Company will provide a market for a specified period of time for shares distributed to participants. The put price is the appraised value of the stock. The fair value of allocated shares of common stock held by the ESOP are deducted from permanent shareholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and reflected in a line item below liabilities and above shareholders equity. This presentation is necessary in order to recognize the put option within the ESOP-owned shares, consistent with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines, that is present as long as the Company is not publicly traded. The Company uses a valuation by an external third party to determine the maximum possible cash obligation related to these securities. Increases or decreases in the value of the cash obligation are included in a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity. The fair value of allocated shares held by the ESOP at September 30, 2024 was million, based on the Company s previously disclosed appraised value of per share of common stock. The fair value at December 31, 2023 was million, based on the Company s previously disclosed appraised value of per share of common stock. As previously disclosed, these appraised values were determined solely for purposes of the ESOP s administration and are therefore subject to certain limitations, qualifications and assumptions and may not reflect the fair value of the Company s common stock and should not be relied on for any reason. Neither the Company nor the ESOP has any obligation to seek an adjusted valuation, to use these appraised values for any other purpose or, if the Company or the ESOP obtains a new appraised value, to disclose such new appraised value.

Overview 
 BancPlus is a bank holding company headquartered in Ridgeland, Mississippi. Our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, BankPlus, offers a full suite of products and services to a broad spectrum of customers, including individuals, businesses and public entities. As of September 30, 2024, we operated 83 branch offices across Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida. Our franchise is built on a community banking approach focused on personalized, relationship-driven service combined with local market management and expertise. We have one reportable segment. 
 BancPlus business strategy is to provide exceptional community banking services and financial solutions within its markets, which enables us to fulfill our core purpose of enriching lives and building stronger communities. We believe our team of local, experienced and relationship-focused bankers, along with strong brand recognition in our communities, differentiate us from our competitors. As a result, we have a granular, stable deposit mix and a diversified loan portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, we had 6.720 billion of total deposits, and our deposit base consisted of 87.9 core deposits, defined as total deposits less brokered deposits and time deposits greater than 250,000, with a total deposit cost of 2.53 for the year to date period. Our loan portfolio was comprised of 71.4 commercial loans and 28.6 consumer loans for the same period. BancPlus currently holds meaningful market share in a number of attractive markets in Mississippi, including the number three position based on deposits in the Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan statistical area as of June 30, 2024, and we believe we are well-positioned for future growth.

 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 49.0 million, compared with 42.6 million for the same period of 2023 
 Diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.15, compared with 3.72 for the same period of 2023 
 Net interest income was 174.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 172.5 million for the same period of 2023

 Recent Regulatory Developments 
 
 On September 17, 2024, the FDIC finalized changes to its Statement of Policy on Bank Merger Transactions (the Policy Statement ), which outlines factors that the FDIC will consider when evaluating a proposed bank merger transaction. Also on September 17, 2024, the United States Department of Justice (the DOJ withdrew its 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines and announced that it will instead evaluate the competitive impact of bank mergers using its 2023 Merger Guidelines that the DOJ applies to mergers in all industries. Compared to the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines, the 2023 Merger Guidelines set forth more stringent concentration limits and add several largely qualitative bases on which the DOJ may challenge a merger. While the effect of these changes for particular transactions remains unclear, both the Policy Statement and the change in the DOJ s bank merger antitrust policy may make it more difficult and/or costly for us to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or otherwise result in more onerous conditions to obtain approval for an acquisition. 
 
 On July 30, 2024, the FDIC issued a proposed rule that would revise the FDIC s regulations governing the classification and treatment of brokered deposits. The proposal would, among other changes, broaden the definition of deposit broker to include agents that place or facilitate the placement of third-party deposits at only one insured depository institution and agents that receive a fee or other remuneration in exchange for the placement of deposits. In addition, the proposal would narrow the exception to the definition of deposit broker for agents whose primary purpose is not the placement of funds with depository institutions. While we are evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule, if the rule is finalized as proposed, BankPlus may be required to classify a greater amount of its deposits obtained with the involvement of third parties as brokered deposits. An increase in the amount of brokered deposits on the Bank s balance sheet could, among other consequences, increase the Bank s deposit insurance assessment costs.

The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or for any other period. 
 Net Income 
 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 16.9 million and 12.3 million, respectively. BancPlus annualized return on average assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.86 and 0.65 , respectively. BancPlus annualized return on average equity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 8.86 and 7.02 , respectively. 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 49.0 million and 42.6 million, respectively. BancPlus annualized return on average assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.85 and 0.78 , respectively. BancPlus annualized return on average equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 8.81 and 8.24 , respectively. 
 
 The increase in net income and return on average assets and equity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily the result of increased net interest income and decreased noninterest expense in the current year period. 
 
 The increase in net income and return on average assets and equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily the result of increased other operating income and decreased noninterest expense in the current year period. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income represents interest income less interest expense. BancPlus generates interest income from interest, dividends and fees received on interest-earning assets, including loans and investment securities. BancPlus incurs interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including interest-bearing deposits, borrowings and other forms of indebtedness. Net interest income typically is the most significant contributor to BancPlus net income. To evaluate net interest income, BancPlus measures and monitors: (i) yields on its loans and other interest-earning assets; (ii) the costs of its deposits and other funding sources; (iii) its net interest spread; and (iv) its net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as the annualized net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareholders equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources. 
 
 Changes in market interest rates and interest BancPlus earns on interest-earning assets or pays on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders equity, usually have the largest impact on periodic changes in its net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. BancPlus measures net interest income before and after the provision for credit losses that BancPlus maintains. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income was 108.6 million, an increase of 12.8 million, or 13.3 , compared to interest income of 95.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily the result of higher interest rates in the current year period as well as increased interest-earning assets as a result of increased balances of interest bearing deposits with banks and investment securities. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income was 314.2 million, an increase of 47.9 million, or 18.0 , compared to interest income of 266.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily the result of higher interest rates in the current year period as well as increased interest-earning assets as a result of organic loan growth and increased balances of interest bearing deposits with banks and investment securities. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense was 48.6 million, an increase of 9.6 million, or 24.6 , compared to interest expense of 39.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily the result of higher interest rates and increased interest-bearing deposits in the current year period. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense was 139.6 million, an increase of 45.8 million, or 48.8 , compared to interest expense of 93.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily the result of higher interest rates and increased interest-bearing deposits in the current year period. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was 60.0 million, an increase of 3.2 million, or 5.6 , compared to net interest income of 56.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was 174.7 million, an increase of 2.1 million, or 1.2 , compared to net interest income of 172.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4 basis points to 3.26 from 3.22 for the same period of 2023, relatively unchanged compared to the prior year period. Net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 15 basis points to 3.20 from 3.35 for the same period of 2023, primarily as a result of the higher interest rate environment seen in the current year with rates on interest-bearing liabilities outpacing yields on interest-earning assets in the current period. 
 
 Our year to date average interest-earning assets at September 30, 2024 increased 0.41 billion, or 5.99 , to 7.28 billion from 6.87 billion at September 30, 2023. BancPlus average interest-bearing liabilities at September 30, 2024 increased 0.59 billion, or 11.70 , to 5.61 billion from 5.02 billion at September 30, 2023. These increases in BancPlus average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities were primarily due to organic loan and deposit growth. The ratio of BancPlus average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities was 129.7 and 136.7 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 BancPlus average interest-earning assets produced a tax-equivalent yield of 5.90 and 5.76 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.43 and 5.17 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 3.42 and 3.32 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.96 and 2.49 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The year-over-year changes in yields reflects the rising interest rate environment seen in the current year period. 
 Average Balances and Yields 
 The following tables show, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average balances of each principal category of BancPlus assets, liabilities and shareholders equity, and an analysis of net interest income.

 Rate/Volume Analysis 
 
 Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between the changes related to the outstanding balances and those due to changes in interest rates. The change in interest attributable to rate has been determined by applying the change in rate between periods to average balances outstanding in the earlier period. The change in interest due to volume has been determined by applying the rate from the later period to the change in average balances outstanding between periods. The following table presents the changes in the volume and rate of BancPlus interest-bearing assets and liabilities for the dates indicated:

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 The provision for credit losses is the amount of expense that, based on BancPlus judgment, is required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an adequate level to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and that, in management s judgment, is appropriate under relevant accounting guidance. The determination of the provision for credit losses is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses was 796,000, compared to 925,000 for the same period of 2023, a decrease of 129,000, or 13.9 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses was 4.3 million, compared to 2.4 million for the same period of 2023, an increase of 2.0 million, or 83.1 . The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the calculated loss rate on historical balances as well as an increase in the balance of the loan portfolio.

 Noninterest Income 
 
 Noninterest income consists of: (i) service charges on deposit accounts; (ii) mortgage origination income; (iii) debit card interchange fees; (iv) income from fiduciary activities; (v) ATM income; (vi) brokerage and insurance fees and commissions, (vii) life insurance income, and (viii) other noninterest income. 
 
 BancPlus income from service charges on deposit accounts and debit card interchange fees is largely affected by the volume, growth and type of deposits BancPlus holds, which are impacted by prevailing market conditions for BancPlus deposit products, market interest rates, marketing efforts, and other factors. 
 
 Service charges on deposit accounts include fees and miscellaneous charges on deposit products offered by BancPlus. Mortgage origination income represents the gains recorded on the sale of mortgages originated by BancPlus. Debit card interchange represents income from the use of check cards by our customers.

 group. Life insurance income includes earnings and benefits paid on bank-owned life insurance policies. Other income includes various types of income including gains on sale of other real estate, personalized check sales, and wire transfer fees. 
 
 Noninterest income decreased 435,000, or 2.39 , to 17.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 18.2 million for the same period of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in CDFI grants offset by increases in other income, mortgage origination income, and life insurance income. 
 
 The following table presents the major components of noninterest income for three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023:

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 507,000, or 0.5 , to 95.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 96.1 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense is primarily due to reduced medical and dental insurance expenses in the current year period. 
 
 Furniture, equipment and data processing expenses decreased 509,000, or 2.2 , to 22.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22.7 million, for the same period of 2023. The decrease is primarily the result of data processing expense savings in the current year period. 
 
 Professional fees decreased 1.3 million, or 27.9 , to 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.6 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to higher legal expenses in the prior year period related to the previously disclosed Joint Settlement in the Madison Timber proceeding partially offset by increased consulting expense in the current year period. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 The provision for income taxes includes both federal and state taxes. Fluctuations in effective tax rates reflect the effect of the differences in the inclusion or deductibility of certain income and expenses for income tax purposes, the mix of BancPlus taxable and tax-free investments and loans, and its overall taxable income. 
 
 BancPlus recorded income tax expense of 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.6 million for the same period of 2023, an increase of 722,000, or 20.0 . BancPlus effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.4 , compared to 22.6 for the same period of 2023. 
 
 BancPlus recorded income tax expense of 12.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.5 million for the same period of 2023, an increase of 738,000, or 6.4 . BancPlus effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.0 , compared to 21.3 for the same period of 2023. 
 
 For both the three and nine month periods, the increase in income tax expense was the result of larger income before taxes in the current year period. The decreases in the effective tax rate for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same periods of 2023 was the result of the impact of permanent tax items. 

Financial Condition 
 
 The following discussion compares BancPlus financial condition as of September 30, 2024 to December 31, 2023.

Total cash and cash equivalents increased 162.6 million, or 61.0 , to 429.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 266.6 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases in deposits.

 The objective of BancPlus investment policy is to invest funds to provide sufficient liquidity, optimize the total return of the portfolio, mitigate interest rate risk, and meet pledging requirements. In doing so, BancPlus balances the market and credit risks against the potential investment return, makes most investments compatible with the pledge requirements of any deposits of public funds, and maintains compliance with regulatory investment requirements. BancPlus investment policy allows portfolio holdings to include short-term securities purchased to provide needed liquidity and longer term securities purchased to generate stable income over periods of interest rate fluctuations.

 Additionally, BancPlus enters into various other transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers including commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit beyond current funding are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Such commitments generally have fixed expiration 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. At September 30, 2024, BancPlus had total off-balance sheet commitments of 993.7 million. At September 30, 2024, BancPlus had an allowance for credit loss on off-balance sheet commitments of 6.1 million. 
 
 Asset Quality 
 
 Federal regulations and BancPlus internal policies require that BancPlus utilize an asset classification system as a means of managing and reporting problem and potential problem assets. BancPlus has incorporated an internal asset classification system, substantially consistent with federal banking regulations, as part of its credit monitoring system. Federal banking regulations set forth a classification scheme for problem and potential problem assets as substandard, doubtful or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose BancPlus to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the categories mentioned above but possess weakness are required to be designated watch or special mention. 
 
 The tables below set forth information on BancPlus asset classification as of the dates indicated. BancPlus had no assets classified as loss.

Nonperforming Assets 
 
 Nonperforming loans include loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and loans that are 90 days past due and still accruing. Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans plus foreclosed assets (i.e. real estate acquired through foreclosure). 
 
 The following table summarizes BancPlus nonperforming assets, by category, as of the dates indicated:

 Total nonperforming assets increased by 16.2 million, or 157.0 , from 10.3 million at December 31, 2023 to 26.6 million at September 30, 2024, primarily the result of increases in nonaccrual and past due real estate loans in the current year period. This increase in nonperforming loans for the period ended September 30, 2024 resulted in corresponding increases in the ratios for nonperforming loans to total loans and nonperforming assets to total assets and a decrease in the ratio for allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans. 
 
 The balance of nonperforming assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions. BancPlus has established a policy to discontinue accruing interest on a loan (that is, place the loan on nonaccrual status) after it has become 90 days delinquent as to 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 payment of principal or interest, unless the loan is considered to be well-secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest that is accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. Generally, payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied directly to principal. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The allowance for credit losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. BancPlus maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level management considers adequate to provide for expected credit losses on loans over the life of the loan. The level of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of estimated losses in the portfolio, after consideration of risk characteristics of the loans and prevailing economic conditions. Loan charge-offs (i.e. loans judged to be uncollectible) are charged against the reserve and any subsequent recovery is credited to the reserve. BancPlus made the policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on loans from the estimate of credit losses. The Company calculates estimated credit loss on its portfolio primarily using quantitative methodologies using relevant available information from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. The ACL is evaluated and calculated on a collective basis for those loans which share similar risk characteristics. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether the loans in a pool continue to exhibit similar risk characteristics as the other loans and whether it needs to evaluate the allowance on an individual basis. The Company has chosen to segment its portfolio consistent with the manner in which it manages the risk of the type of credit. The Company s segments for loans include commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, residential and consumer. 
 
 Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of each loan taking into consideration expected prepayments. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications. Also included in the allowance for credit losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Company s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative method or the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that the Company considers include the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and non-accrual loans and current business conditions. 
 
 These estimates are reviewed at least quarterly, and, as adjustments become necessary, they are recognized in the periods in which they become known. During the third quarter of 2024, the U.S. economy continued to experience volatility and there remains uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions as a result of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Although management strives to maintain an allowance it deems adequate, future economic changes, deterioration of borrowers creditworthiness, and the impact of examinations by regulatory agencies all could cause changes to BancPlus allowance for credit losses. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses increased 5.2 million, or 7.9 , to 71.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 65.9 million at December 31, 2023. As a percentage of loans, the allowance for credit losses was 1.16 and 1.08 , at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the calculated loss rate on historical balances as well as an increase in the balance of the loan portfolio. Net charge-offs totaled 2.0 million and 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The variance was primarily the result of an increase in charge-offs on commercial and industrial and consumer and other loans partially offset by an increase in recoveries on consumer and other loans in the current year period.

 BancPlus relies on increasing its deposit base to fund loans and other asset growth. BancPlus competes for local deposits by offering a variety of products at competitive rates. The increase in total average deposits of 475.9 million, or 7.9 , to 6.50 billion at September 30, 2024 from 6.03 billion as of December 31, 2023 primarily resulted from increases in money market and other savings accounts and certificates of deposit driven by the higher interest rate market in addition to an increase in brokered deposits. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BancPlus held deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limits estimated at 1.76 billion and 1.99 billion, respectively. 
 
 The following table shows the maturity of certificates of deposit, including brokered time deposits, as of September 30, 2024:

 Borrowed Funds 
 
 Short-term Borrowings . In addition to deposits, BancPlus uses short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, to meet the daily liquidity needs of its customers and fund its loan growth. Federal funds purchased represent primarily overnight borrowings through relationships with correspondent banks. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are considered overnight borrowings and are secured by U.S. Government agency securities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BancPlus had no short-term borrowings. The following is a summary of our short-term borrowings during the periods presented.

 Advances from Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB and Other Borrowings . BankPlus is a member of the FHLB, and as a result, is eligible for advances from the FHLB pursuant to the terms of various borrowing agreements, which assist BancPlus in the funding of its loan and investment portfolios. BancPlus FHLB advances are collateralized by a blanket lien on first mortgage and other qualifying loans. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BancPlus had 230.0 million and 375.1 million in FHLB borrowings, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.40 and 4.79 , respectively. 
 
 The Company also has available funding from the Federal Reserve Bank s discount window which it utilizes from time to time for short-term funding. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had zero borrowings outstanding with the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 
 Required principal payments on FHLB advances and other borrowings were as follows:

 Subordinated Debentures. On June 4, 2020, the Company entered into a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement with certain qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors pursuant to which the Company issued and sold 60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.000 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due June 15, 2030 (the Notes ). The Company incurred issuance costs of 1.4 million in conjunction with the issuance of the Notes. These issuance costs are netted with the balance of the Notes on the Company s consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized over the life of the Notes. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the remaining unamortized balance of these issuance costs was 821,000 and 928,000, respectively. The Notes initially bear interest at a rate of 6.000 per annum from and including June 4, 2020, to but excluding June 15, 2025 or early redemption date, with interest during this period payable semiannually in arrears. From and including June 15, 2025, to but excluding the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual floating rate equal to the Three-Month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 586 basis points, with interest during this period payable quarterly in arrears. The Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. The Company used the proceeds from the Notes for general corporate purposes, including improving the Company s liquidity and capital position. 
 
 The Notes are not redeemable by the Company, in whole or in part, prior to the fifth anniversary of the original date of issue, except that the Notes may be redeemed at any time in whole but not in part in the event of a Tier 2 Capital Event, a Tax Event, or an Investment Company Event, each as defined and described in the Notes. On or after the fifth anniversary of the original date of issue, the Notes are redeemable on any interest payment date at the option of the Company, in whole or in part in integral 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 multiples of 1,000, at an amount equal to 100 of the outstanding principal amount redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon. Any partial redemption will be made on a pro rata basis as to the holders of the Notes. Any redemption of the Notes is subject to any applicable regulatory requirements and approvals. 
 
 Effective March 1, 2022, in conjunction with the FTC Merger, the Company assumed FTC s obligations under its Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 23, 2020, and the several purchasers of the 21.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030 issued thereunder (the FTC Subordinated Notes ). The FTC Subordinated Notes will mature on December 30, 2030 and bear interest at an initial fixed rate of 5.50 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears. From and including December 30, 2025, to but excluding the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to a Three-Month Term SOFR plus 527 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. BancPlus will be entitled to redeem the FTC Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date on or after December 30, 2025, and to redeem the FTC Subordinated Notes in whole upon certain other events. The FTC Subordinated Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holder. The FTC Subordinated Notes are unsecured, subordinated obligations of BancPlus only and are not obligations of, and are not guaranteed by, any subsidiary of BancPlus. The FTC Subordinated Notes rank junior in right to payment to BancPlus current and future senior indebtedness. The FTC Subordinated Notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. The FTC Subordinated Notes vary from the amount carried on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 due to the remaining purchase premium of 251,000, which was established upon closing of the FTC Merger and is being amortized over the remaining life of the debentures. 
 
 BancPlus also owns the outstanding common stock of business trusts that have issued preferred capital securities to third parties. The preferred capital securities have qualified as Tier 1 capital, subject to regulatory rules and limits. These trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of the common stock and preferred capital securities to purchase subordinated debentures that BancPlus issued. The subordinated debentures are these trusts only assets, and quarterly interest payments on these subordinated debentures are the sole source of cash for these trusts to pay quarterly distributions on the common stock and preferred capital securities. BancPlus has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the trusts obligations on preferred capital securities. 
 
 The following table is a summary of debentures payable to statutory trusts: 
 (Dollars in thousands) Year of Maturity Interest Rate September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 First Bancshares of Baton Rouge Statutory Trust I 2034 3 month CME Term SOFR, plus 2.50 4,124 4,124 State Capital Statutory Trust IV 2035 3 month CME Term SOFR, plus 1.99 5,155 5,155 BancPlus Statutory Trust II 2036 3 month CME Term SOFR, plus 1.50 20,619 20,619 BancPlus Statutory Trust III 2037 3 month CME Term SOFR, plus 1.35 20,619 20,619 State Capital Master Trust 2037 3 month CME Term SOFR, plus 1.46 6,186 6,186 56,703 56,703 
 
 The subordinated debentures payable to statutory trusts vary from the amount carried on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 due to the remaining purchase discount of 3.3 million, which was established upon the SCC Merger and is being amortized over the remaining life of the debentures. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the remaining unamortized purchase discount was 3.3 million and 3.5 million, respectively. 
 
 Interest rates adjust quarterly for the subordinated debentures with rates that were nominally indexed with LIBOR. Following the LIBOR cessation date of June 30, 2023, the interest rate on the subordinated notes was replaced with SOFR pursuant to the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act. 
 
 The Company has the right to redeem the subordinated debentures prior to maturity. Upon redemption of the subordinated debentures payable to a statutory trust, the trust will also liquidate its common stock and preferred capital securities. BancPlus believes that it will be able to meet its principal and interest payment obligations as they come due through maintenance of adequate cash levels or subsequent borrowings. BancPlus expects to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. BancPlus has in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs.

 Shareholders Equity 
 
 Shareholders equity is influenced primarily by earnings, quarterly dividend payments, changes in common stock outstanding, and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) caused primarily by fluctuations in unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, on available for sale investment securities. 
 
 Shareholders equity increased 48.1 million, or 6.6 , to 773.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 725.1 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to net income of 49.0 million and stock based compensation of 3.8 million, partially offset by dividends paid of 16.4 million and other comprehensive loss of 14.4 million. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Bank Liquidity Management 
 
 Liquidity is BancPlus capacity to meet its cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost, having cash when BancPlus needs it and having the appropriate amount of cash and other assets that are quickly convertible into cash without incurring significant loss. BancPlus is expected to maintain adequate liquidity at BankPlus to meet the cash flow requirements of its customers who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on BancPlus ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows and collateral needs without adversely affecting either BancPlus daily operations or its financial condition. BancPlus Asset Liability Management Committee ALCO ), which is comprised of members of senior management, is responsible for managing commitments to meet the needs of customers while achieving its financial objectives. ALCO meets regularly to review balance sheet composition, funding capacities, and current and forecasted loan demand, and BancPlus Treasury Management department continuously monitors its liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all of its short-term and long-term cash requirements. 
 
 BancPlus manages its liquidity by maintaining adequate levels of cash and other assets from on and off-balance sheet arrangements. Specifically, on-balance sheet liquidity consists of cash and due from banks and unpledged investment securities, which BancPlus considers its primary liquidity. Furthermore, a significant portion of these unencumbered liquid assets are comprised of U.S. government agency obligations, mortgage backed securities and other agency securities, which the regulatory bodies consider the most marketable and liquid, especially in a stress scenario. In regard to off-balance sheet capacity, BancPlus maintains available borrowing capacity under secured borrowing lines with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, as well as unsecured lines of credit for the purpose of overnight funds with various correspondent banks, which BancPlus considers secondary liquidity. BancPlus also monitors its liquidity requirements in light of interest rate trends, changes in the economy, scheduled maturities and interest rate sensitivity of investments, loans, borrowings and deposits. As part of its liquidity management strategy, BancPlus is also focused on minimizing its costs of liquidity by growing its noninterest-bearing and other low-cost deposits and replacing higher cost borrowed funds. 
 
 The following tables provide a summary of BancPlus primary and secondary liquidity levels.

 3,205,870 2,646,099 Ratio of primary and secondary liquidity to total deposits 66.7 58.5 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, BancPlus primary liquidity increased by 221.2 million to 1.28 billion, compared to 1.06 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and securities. Secondary liquidity increased by 559.8 million to 3.21 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 2.65 billion as of December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in BancPlus Federal Reserve borrowing capacity. 
 
 In addition to its primary liquidity, BancPlus generates liquidity from cash flows from its loan and securities portfolios and from its large base of core customer deposits, defined as total deposits less brokered deposits and time deposits greater than 250,000. Core deposits totaled 5.91 billion and 5.77 billion and represented 87.9 and 91.1 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These core deposits are normally less volatile, often with customer relationships tied to other products, which promote long-standing relationships and stable funding sources. 
 
 Holding Company Liquidity Management 
 
 BancPlus is a corporation separate and apart from BankPlus and, therefore, it must provide for its own liquidity. BancPlus main source of funding is dividends declared and paid to it by BankPlus. Statutory and regulatory limitations exist that affect the ability of BankPlus to pay dividends to the holding company. BancPlus believes that these limitations will not impact the ability of the holding company to meet its ongoing short-term cash obligations. 
 
 Due to state banking laws, BankPlus may not pay dividends without the prior approval of the MDBCF. BankPlus received permission from the MDBCF to pay dividends of 21.6 million to BancPlus for both of the year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. These dividends were used by the holding company to pay dividends to the BancPlus shareholders, principal and interest payments on debt and general operating expenses. 
 
 Capital Management and Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 
 BancPlus is subject to various capital requirements administered by federal banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by federal banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on BancPlus business operations. 
 
 In 2019, the federal bank regulatory agencies finalized a rule that simplifies capital requirements for qualifying community banks by providing an option to use a simple leverage ratio to measure capital adequacy and to not calculate risk-based capital ratios. A qualifying community bank has less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities, and a leverage ratio greater than 9.0 . The community bank leverage ratio CBLR framework was effective on January 1, 2020, and the Company and the Bank elected to adopt the optional CBLR framework in the third quarter of 2022, as an alternative to the generally applicable capital rules. 
 
 Further, under prompt corrective action regulations, an insured depository institution is classified in one of several tiers based on its level of capital and other factors, and may be subject to an escalating series of remedial measures if it is less than well capitalized. An institution is deemed well capitalized if it satisfies certain capital ratios and is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank maintained a leverage ratio of more than 9.0 and, as an institution has elected to adopt the CBLR framework, the Bank was therefore well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BancPlus and BankPlus met the minimum CBLR requirement and therefore satisfied the capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. As a bank holding company, BancPlus is not subject to the prompt corrective action regime that applies to insured depository institutions, including BankPlus.

 Contractual Obligations 
 
 Contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 totaled 2.27 billion and were primarily comprised of deposits with maturities of 1.86 billion, subordinated debentures of 133.8 million and operating lease obligations of 41.9 million. Contractual obligations due within the next twelve months were 1.53 billion and were primarily related to time deposits with maturity dates and short-term FHLB advances due in 2023-2024. Contractual obligations due in more than 12 months were 0.74 billion and were comprised of 380.5 million of time deposits with maturity dates and 133.8 million of subordinated debentures with maturities ranging from 2030 through 2037. BancPlus expects to have adequate liquidity to meet these short and long-term obligations through profitability, repayments from loans and investment securities, deposit gathering activity and access to borrowing sources. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 1 Basis of Presentation in our Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed under Item 7 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, previously filed with the SEC. 

Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 As a financial institution, BancPlus primary market risk is interest rate risk, which is defined as the risk of economic loss due to changes in interest rates. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or loss of current fair market value. BancPlus regularly seeks to measure and manage the potential impact of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk occurs 
 62 

Table of Contents 

 when interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price at different times, on a different basis or in unequal amounts. Interest rate risk also arises when BancPlus assets and liabilities each respond differently to changes in interest rates. 
 
 BancPlus management of interest rate risk is overseen by the ALCO. BancPlus risk management infrastructure, approved by the BancPlus Board of Directors, outlines reporting and measurement requirements. In particular, this infrastructure establishes limits and management targets for various metrics, including net interest income at risk and economic value of equity at risk, given instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates. BancPlus risk management infrastructure also requires a periodic review of all key assumptions used, such as appropriate interest rate scenarios, loan prepayment rates, and transaction deposit durations. 
 
 BancPlus currently does not utilize derivative products to manage interest rate risk, although its policy does allow the use of derivatives within established parameters. BancPlus manages the interest rate risk associated with its interest bearing liabilities by managing the interest rates and terms associated with its borrowings and customer deposits on which BancPlus relies for funding. For instance, BancPlus occasionally uses special offers on deposits to attract additional balances, maintain current balances, and manage terms associated with its interest-bearing liabilities. BancPlus manages the interest rate risk associated with its earning assets by managing the interest rates and terms associated with its loan portfolio and investment securities portfolio. 
 
 Net Interest Income Simulation and Economic Value Analysis 
 
 On a quarterly basis, BancPlus uses a model to simulate and measure potential changes in its net interest income and economic value of equity EVE given instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates. BancPlus net interest income at risk simulation measures shorter term risk over 12 and 24 month time frames. EVE measures the period end market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value given the changes in interest rates. EVE is a point-in-time measurement that helps quantify longer term interest rate risk in the current balance sheet. The model has inherent limitations since the results are based on a given set of rate changes and assumptions as of a certain point in time. For purpose of the simulation, BancPlus assumes no balance sheet growth. Therefore, the model s results reflect an interest rate shock to a static balance sheet. 
 
 Potential changes over a 12-month horizon to BancPlus net interest income and EVE in hypothetical rising and declining interest rate scenarios calculated as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are presented in the table below. The projections for September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 assume immediate, parallel shifts down from the yield curves of 100, 200, and 300 basis points and immediate, parallel shifts up of 100, 200, and 300 basis points. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 
 As of December 31, 2023 
 (Dollars in thousands) Change in Net Interest Income Change in Economic Value of Equity Change in Net Interest Income Change in Economic Value of Equity Parallel Rate Shift (basis points) 300 1,337 0.5 (104,537) (10.9) (15,978) (6.8) (79,469) (12.4) 200 (1,109) (0.4) (68,924) (7.2) (10,341) (4.4) (51,902) (8.1) 100 (3,416) (1.3) (39,738) (4.1) (5,076) (2.1) (25,440) (4.0) Unchanged -100 (3,217) (1.2) 6,483 0.7 5,559 2.4 22,024 3.4 -200 (2,662) (1.0) 7,393 0.8 10,292 4.4 38,680 6.0 -300 1,266 0.5 (208) 14,391 6.1 52,515 8.2 
 
 The table above indicates that in the event of an immediate and sustained 300 basis point increase in interest rates, BancPlus would have experienced a 0.5 increase in net interest income in year one and an 10.9 decrease in EVE as of September 30, 2024. At December 31, 2023, in the event of an immediate and sustained 300 basis point increase in interest, BancPlus would have experienced a 6.8 decrease in net interest income and a 12.4 decrease in EVE. In the event of an immediate 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, BancPlus would have experienced a decrease of 1.2 in net interest income and a 0.7 increase in EVE as of September 30, 2024, and a 2.4 increase in net interest income and a 3.4 increase in EVE as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The results of this simulation analysis are hypothetical, and a variety of factors might cause actual results to differ substantially from what is depicted. The timing and magnitude of interest rate changes will most likely differ substantially from what is depicted. The shape or steepness of the yield curve typically changes with each change in the Fed Funds target range. Results could also change depending on faster or slower prepays in loans or early withdrawals in deposits than those assumed in the 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 model. Finally, the results do not incorporate growth in the balance sheet or strategic changes made in response to changes in rates. 
 
 Because of the flaws in the nature of the static balance sheet rate shocks, ALCO also periodically reviews model simulations that incorporate many of the factors mentioned above. These alternate scenarios change given the current economic environment, but may include the following: (1) expected balance sheet growth, (2) changes in rates timed with Federal Open Market Committee meetings, (3) increased early withdrawals of time deposits, (4) shifts in funding out of deposits and into wholesale borrowings, and (5) decreased growth of loans and deposits. Using a variety of scenarios in addition to BancPlus standard shocked scenarios enables ALCO to form a more accurate analysis of BancPlus overall interest rate sensitivity. 
 
 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 BancPlus consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of BancPlus assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on BancPlus performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods or services. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by our management, with the participation of BancPlus Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of BancPlus disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, BancPlus disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by BancPlus in the reports required to be filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Effective January 1, 2023, BancPlus adopted FASB ASU 2016-13. BancPlus implemented changes to its policies, processes and controls over the estimation of the allowance for credit losses to support the adoption of FASB ASU 2016-13. Management revised previous internal controls used under legacy GAAP and incorporated new internal controls to ensure adequacy of the reserve levels under the new allowance for credit losses methodology. Changes to internal controls as a result of adopting FASB ASU 2016-13 were a result of changes in the calculation under the new allowance for credit losses methodology and did not change the overall nature of the controls. 
 
 There has been no change in BancPlus internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, BancPlus internal control over financial reporting.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Spouse of a married Participant shall be his Beneficiary unless that Spouse has consented in writing to the designation by the Participant of some other person or trust and the Spouse s consent acknowledges the effect of the designation and is witnessed by a notary public or a Plan representative. A Participant may change his designation at any time. However, a Participant may not change his designation without further consent of his Spouse under the terms of the preceding sentence unless the Spouse s consent permits designation of another person or trust without further spousal consent and acknowledges that the Spouse has the right to limit consent to a specific beneficiary and that the Spouse voluntarily relinquishes this right. Notwithstanding the above, the Spouse s consent shall not be required if the Participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Plan Administrator that the Spouse cannot be located if the Participant has a court order indicating that he is legally separated or has been abandoned (within the meaning of local law), unless a qualified domestic relations order (as defined in Code Section 414(p)) provides otherwise, or if there are other circumstances as the Secretary of the Treasury prescribes. If the Spouse is legally incompetent to give consent, consent by the Spouse s legal guardian shall be 
 4 

deemed to be consent by the Spouse.

 (i) the aggregate number of Financed Shares released due to the payment of principal and or interest on the Acquisition Loan during the Plan Year (as determined under Section 5.1(b) of the Plan), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount of cash dividends or other cash distributions used from all Participants Other Investment Subaccounts to repay the Acquisition Loan during the Plan Year, and the denominator of which is the amount of the aggregate payment of principal and or interest (as determined under Section 5.1(b) of the Plan) paid with respect to the Acquisition Loan for such Plan Year and 
 
 (ii) the number of released Financed Shares having a Fair Market Value at least equal to the amount of the cash dividends or other cash distributions paid with respect to Company Stock held in Participants Company Stock Subaccounts which are used to repay the Acquisition Loan. 
 
 (2) The number of Financed Shares determined pursuant to Paragraph (1) hereof shall be allocated to each Participant s Company Stock Subaccount in the same proportion that the cash dividends or other cash distributions used from such Participant s Other Investment Subaccount to repay the Acquisition Loan during the Plan Year bears to the total amount of cash dividends and other cash distributions so used from all Participants Other Investment Subaccounts. 
 
 (b) Following the allocation to Participants Company Stock Subaccounts pursuant to Subsection (a)(1)(i) above, if any, any remaining Financed Shares released from the Loan Suspense Account shall be allocated to Participants Company Stock Subaccounts in the same manner as described in Section 4.2(b) to the subaccount in the ESOP Plan determined based on whether the contribution used to repay the Acquisition Loan was made under Section 3.2 or 3.3 of the Plan.

 (b) Cash dividends and other cash distributions (and any income thereon) paid with respect to shares of Company Stock held in a Participant s Company Stock Subaccount shall be credited to such Participant s Other Investment Subaccount on the last day of the calendar quarter based on the number of shares allocated to a Participant s Company Stock Subaccount as of the first day of the calendar quarter increased by any contributions and reduced by any distributions thereafter. 
 
 (c) Any additional shares of Company Stock which are issued with respect to any Company Stock held in a Company Stock Subaccount, including, but not limited to, stock dividends, shall be allocated to that Company Stock Subaccount as of the Valuation Date for the ESOP Plan coinciding with or next following the date on which the additional shares of Company Stock are delivered to the Trustee.

 (2) Synthetic Equity . Synthetic Equity is treated as owned by the person that has any of the rights specified in Subsection (d) below. In addition, the attribution rules as set forth in Paragraph (1) of this Subsection apply for purposes of attributing ownership of Synthetic Equity. The attribution of Synthetic Equity under this Paragraph shall be applied before the general attribution rules of Paragraph (1) hereof. 
 
 (3) Special Rule for Certain Stock Rights . 
 
 (i) For purposes of determining if a Plan Year is a Nonallocation Year, a person is treated as owning stock if the person has an exercisable right to acquire the stock, the stock is both issued and outstanding, and the stock is held by persons other than the ESOP Plan, the Primary Sponsor, or a Related Entity. 
 
 (ii) This Paragraph applies only if treating persons as owning the shares described in Clause (i) above results in a Nonallocation Year. This Paragraph does not apply to a right to acquire stock of the Primary Sponsor held by a shareholder that is subject to Federal income tax that, under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1361-1(l)(2)(iii)(A) or (l)(4)(iii)(C), would not be taken into account in determining if an S Corporation has a second class of stock, provided that a principal purpose of the right is not the avoidance or evasion of Code Section 409(p). This Paragraph does not 
 30 

apply for purposes of determining ownership of Deemed Owned Shares or whether an interest constitutes Synthetic Equity. 
 
 (4) Application with Respect to Shares Treated as Owned by More Than One Person . For purposes of determining if a Plan Year is a Nonallocation Year if, by application of the rules of Paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this Subsection, any share is treated as owned by more than one person, then that share is counted as a single share and that share is treated as owned by Disqualified Persons if any of the owners is a Disqualified Person. 
 
 (d) Rules of Application . 
 
 (1) Number of Synthetic Equity Shares . 
 
 (i) Based on Value of Company Stock . If Synthetic Equity is determined in reference to the value of Company Stock, the person entitled to such Synthetic Equity is treated as owning the number of shares of stock deliverable pursuant to such Synthetic Equity. If payment of such Synthetic Equity is to be made in a form other than Company Stock, the number of shares of Synthetic Equity treated as owned is equal to the number of shares of Company Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the cash or other property in which payment is to be made (disregarding lapse restrictions as described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.83-3(i)). 
 
 (ii) Based on Related Entity . If Synthetic Equity is determined by reference to shares of stock (or similar interests) in a Related Entity, the person entitled to the Synthetic Equity is treated as owning shares of Company Stock with the same aggregate value as the number of shares of stock (or similar interests) of the Related Entity (disregarding lapse restrictions as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.83-3(i)). 
 
 (iii) Other Synthetic Equity . In the case of Synthetic Equity not described in Clause (i) or (ii) hereof, the person entitled to such Synthetic Equity is treated as owning on any date the number of shares of Company Stock equal to the present value (on that date) of the Synthetic Equity (determined without regard to lapse restrictions as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.83-3(i)) divided by the Fair Market Value of a share of Company Stock as of that applicable determination date. For purpose of the Synthetic Equity described in this Clause (iii), the number of shares of Synthetic Equity owned by a person for a Plan Year shall be determined annually on the first day of each Plan Year and the number of shares determined shall be treated as owned by such person until the next determination date, regardless of changes in such Synthetic Equity during the period until the next determination date. 
 
 31 

(iv) Synthetic Equity for Rights to Supervoting Stock . If a Synthetic Equity right includes (directly or indirectly) a right to purchase or receive shares of Company Stock that have per-share voting rights greater than the per-share voting rights of one or more shares of Company Stock held by the Plan, then the number of shares of deemed owned Synthetic Equity attributable to such right is not less than the number of shares of Company Stock that would have the same voting rights if such shares had the same per-share voting rights as shares held by the Plan with the least voting rights. 
 
 (2) Adjustment of Number of Shares of Synthetic Equity . If the ESOP Plan owns less than one hundred percent (100 of the shares of Company Stock outstanding, the number of shares of Synthetic Equity otherwise determined under Paragraph (1) hereof shall be decreased ratably to the extent that shares of Company Stock are owned by a person who is not an employee stock ownership plan as described in Treasury Regulations Section 54.4975-11(a)(5) (and who is subject to Federal income taxes). 
 
 (e) (1) Methods for Prevention of a Nonallocation Year . In the event a Plan Year is a Nonallocation Year or an allocation would otherwise be prohibited under Section 4.8(a), the Plan Administrator may either (i) transfer all or a portion of the Accounts under the ESOP Plan of a Participant who is a Disqualified Person (or a person reasonably expected to become a Disqualified Person absent a transfer described in this Section 4.8(e)) to the Participant s Accounts in the 401(k) Plan or to another plan maintained by the Plan Sponsor that satisfies the requirements of Code Section 401(a) (and that is not an employee stock ownership plan, as described in Treasury Regulations Section 54.4975-11(a)(5)) or (ii) reduce allocations to Participants under the ESOP Plan who are Highly Compensated Employees and who are or may become Disqualified Persons. 
 
 (2) (i) Except as provided in Clause (ii) hereof, in the event of a transfer pursuant to Paragraph (1)(i), at the date of the transfer, the total number of shares of Company Stock transferred, as provided for in Paragraph (1)(i) hereof, shall be charged against the Company Stock Subaccounts of Participants who are Disqualified Persons (A) by first reducing the Company Stock Subaccounts of the Participants who are Disqualified Persons whose Company Stock Subaccounts have the largest number of shares of Company Stock (with the addition of Synthetic Equity) and (B) thereafter by reducing the Company Stock Subaccounts of each succeeding Participant who is a Disqualified Person who has the largest number of shares in his Company Stock Subaccounts (with the addition of Synthetic Equity). 
 
 (ii) Notwithstanding Clause (i) hereof, the number of shares of Company Stock transferred shall be charged against the Company Stock 
 32 

Subaccounts of Participants who are Disqualified Persons (A) by first reducing the Company Stock Subaccount of the Participant with the fewest shares (including Synthetic Equity) who is a Disqualified Person and who is a Highly Compensated Employee to cause the Participant not to be a Disqualified Person and (B) thereafter reducing the Company Stock Subaccounts of each other Participant who is a Disqualified Person and a Highly Compensated Employee, in order of who has the fewest shares of Company Stock in his Company Stock Subaccounts (including Synthetic Equity). A transfer under this Clause (ii) only applies to the extent that the transfer results in fewer shares of Company Stock being transferred than in a transfer under Clause (i) hereof. 
 
 (3) If two or more Participants described in Paragraph (2) hereof have the same number of shares of Company Stock in their Company Stock Subaccounts, the Company Stock Subaccounts of the Participant with the longest service shall be reduced first. Beneficiaries of the Plan are treated as Participants for purposes of this Section 4.8(e). 
 
 ARTICLE 5 
 ACQUISITION LOANS INVESTMENT OF ESOP PLAN 
 
 5.1 Acquisition Loans . 
 
 (a) Except in instances where the Trustee has discretionary authority under the Trust, the Plan Administrator may direct the Trustee to obtain Acquisition Loans. An Acquisition Loan shall meet all requirements necessary to constitute an exempt loan within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 54.4975-7(b)(1)(iii), including the requirement that the Acquisition Loan be primarily for the benefit of Participants and their Beneficiaries. At the time an Acquisition Loan is made, the interest rate for the Acquisition Loan and the price of Company Stock to be acquired therewith may not be such that assets of the Plan might be drained off. The terms of an Acquisition Loan must, at the time the Acquisition Loan is made, be at least as favorable to the ESOP Plan as the terms of a comparable loan resulting from arm s length negotiations between independent parties. The proceeds of any Acquisition Loan shall be used within a reasonable time after the Acquisition Loan is obtained and may only be used to purchase Company Stock, to repay the Acquisition Loan, or to repay any prior Acquisition Loan. An Acquisition Loan shall provide for no more than a reasonable rate of interest. An Acquisition Loan must be without recourse against the ESOP Plan and must be for a specific term and not payable at the demand of any person, except in case of default. For purposes of this Section, default shall mean the failure to pay any amount due under the Acquisition Loan, or any other event specified in the agreement memorializing the Acquisition Loan. The Acquisition Loan s number of years to maturity must be definitely ascertainable. The only assets of the ESOP Plan that may be given as collateral for an Acquisition Loan are shares of Company Stock acquired with its proceeds or used as collateral on a prior Acquisition Loan repaid with the proceeds of the current Acquisition Loan. The 
 33 

Company Stock pledged shall be placed in the Loan Suspense Account. No person entitled to payment under an Acquisition Loan shall have recourse against the ESOP Plan other than that collateral, Plan Sponsor contributions in cash that are made to meet obligations under the Acquisition Loan, earnings attributable to that collateral, and investment of Plan Sponsor contributions. In the event of a default upon an Acquisition Loan, the value of assets of the ESOP Plan transferred in satisfaction thereof shall not exceed the amount of default. If the lender under an Acquisition Loan is a person described in Code Section 4975(e)(2), the Acquisition Loan shall provide for a transfer of ESOP Plan assets upon default only upon and to the extent of the failure of the ESOP Plan to meet the payment schedule of the Acquisition Loan. A pledge of Company Stock must provide for the release of shares pledged, as provided in Subsection (b) below, upon the payment of any portion of the Acquisition Loan. An amendment of a loan in order to qualify under this Section shall not be a refinancing of the loan or the making of another loan. 
 
 (b) For each Plan Year during the duration of the Acquisition Loan, the number of shares of Company Stock released from any pledge and from the Loan Suspense Account must equal the number of shares acquired with the proceeds of the Acquisition Loan held immediately before release for the current Plan Year multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of principal paid for that Plan Year and the denominator of which is the sum of the numerator plus the principal to be paid for all future Plan Years. For purposes of applying the preceding sentence, the following requirements must be satisfied (1) the Acquisition Loan must provide for payments of principal and interest no less frequently than annually at a cumulative rate that is not less rapid at any time than level annual payments of those amounts for ten (10) years (2) interest included in any payment is disregarded only to the extent that it would be determined to be interest under standard loan amortization tables, and (3) by reason of a renewal, extension, or refinancing during or prior to the Plan Year, the sum of the expired duration of the Acquisition Loan, the renewal period, the extension period, and the duration of a new Acquisition Loan do not exceed ten (10) years. If the term of the loan provides for annual payments of principal and interest at a cumulative rate that exceeds ten (10) years, the shares of Company Stock released from the Loan Suspense Account shall be determined by reference to payments of principal and interest. The years in the preceding sentence are determined without taking into account any possible extension or renewal periods. In the event the interest is variable, the interest to be paid in future years must be computed by using the interest rate applicable as of the end of the Plan Year. If collateral in the Loan Suspense Account includes more than one class of Company Stock, the number of shares of each class to be released for a Plan Year must be determined by applying the same fraction to each class. 
 
 (c) Payments of principal and interest on any Acquisition Loan during a Plan Year shall be made by the Trustee, as directed by the Plan Administrator, only from (1) Plan Sponsor contributions made to the Trust to meet the ESOP Plan s obligation under an Acquisition Loan, earnings from Plan Sponsor contributions to the ESOP Plan, and any cash dividends or other cash distributions attributable to Company Stock given as 
 34 

collateral for an Acquisition Loan (both received during or prior to the Plan Year) and any cash dividends or other cash distributions attributable to Company Stock acquired with the proceeds of an Acquisition Loan and allocated to Participants Company Stock Subaccounts or (2) the proceeds of a subsequent Acquisition Loan made to repay a prior Acquisition Loan. The payments made with respect to an Acquisition Loan by the ESOP Plan during a Plan Year will not exceed an amount equal to the sum of such contributions and earnings described in Clause (1) received during or prior to the year less such payments in prior years. Plan Sponsor contributions and earnings must be accounted for separately by the ESOP Plan until the Acquisition Loan is repaid. 
 
 (d) The provisions of this Section shall continue to be applicable to shares of Company Stock acquired hereunder and held in the Loan Suspense Account even if the Plan ceases to be an employee stock ownership plan under Code Section 4975(e)(7). 
 
 5.2 Use of Plan Assets to Purchase Company Stock . Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan, assets in all Accounts under the ESOP Plan may be used to acquire shares of Company Stock from shareholders or from any Plan Sponsor. 
 
 5.3 Purchases of Company Stock . All purchases of Company Stock by the Trust shall be made at Fair Market Value of the Company Stock to the extent required by ERISA. 
 
 5.4 Investment of Plan Assets . All contributions (a) made to the ESOP Plan pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 of the Plan or (b) transferred to the ESOP Matching Account or ESOP Discretionary Account from the 401(k) Matching Account or 401(k) Discretionary Account, respectively, at the election of the Plan Administrator, shall be invested primarily in Company Stock to the extent shares are available. The Trustee may invest and hold up to one hundred percent (100 of the ESOP Plan in Company Stock.

The Trustee shall transfer the shares of Company Stock exchanged 
 51 

for cash from the terminated Participant s Account to the Company Stock Subaccounts of all other Participants which shall be allocated pro rata based on the Fair Market Value of the Company Stock as of the most recent Valuation Date for the ESOP Plan.

ARTICLE 18 
 LIMITATION OF ASSIGNMENT, PAYMENTS TO LEGALLY INCOMPETENT DISTRIBUTEE, AND UNCLAIMED PAYMENTS 
 
 60 

18.1 Anti-Alienation . No benefit which shall be payable under the Plan to any person shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge the same shall be void and no such benefit shall in any manner be liable for, or subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person, nor shall it be subject to attachment or legal process for, or against, such person, and the same shall not be recognized under the Plan, except to such extent as may be required by law. Notwithstanding the above, this Section shall not apply to a qualified domestic relations order (as defined in Code Section 414(p)), and benefits may be paid pursuant to the provisions of such an order. The Plan Administrator shall develop procedures (in accordance with applicable federal regulations) to determine whether a domestic relations order is qualified, and, if so, the method and the procedures for complying therewith. In addition, a distribution to an alternate payee (as defined in Code Section 414(p)) shall be permitted if such distribution is authorized by a qualified domestic relations order, even if the affected Participant has not yet separated from service and has not yet reached the earliest retirement age (as defined in Code Section 414(p)). 
 
 18.2 Exceptions to Anti-Alienation . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the benefit of a Participant shall be subject to legal process and may be assigned, alienated or attached pursuant to a court judgment or settlement provided 
 
 (a) such Participant is ordered or required to pay the Plan in accordance with the following 
 
 (1) a judgment or conviction for a crime involving the Plan 
 
 (2) a civil judgment entered by a court in an action brought in connection with a violation of part 4 of subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or 
 
 (3) a settlement agreement between such Participant and the Secretary of Labor, in connection with a violation (or alleged violation) of part 4 of subtitle B of Title I of ERISA by a fiduciary or any other person and 
 
 (b) the judgment, order, decree, or settlement agreement shall expressly provide for the offset of all or part of the amount ordered or required to be paid to the Plan against such Participant s benefits under the Plan. 
 
 18.3 Termination of Payment . If any person who shall be entitled to any benefit under the Plan shall become bankrupt or shall attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge such benefit under the Plan, then the payment of any such benefit in the event a Participant or Beneficiary is entitled to payment shall, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator, cease and terminate and in that event the Plan Administrator shall direct the Trustee to hold or apply the same for the benefit of such person, his Spouse, children, other dependents or any of them in such manner and in such proportion as the Plan Administrator shall determine. 
 
 18.4 Minors and Incompetents . Whenever any benefit which shall be payable under the Plan is to be paid to or for the benefit of any person who is then a minor or determined to be incompetent by qualified medical advice, the Plan Administrator need not require the 
 61 

appointment of a guardian or custodian, but shall be authorized to cause the same to be paid over to the person having custody of such minor or incompetent, or to cause the same to be paid to such minor or incompetent without the intervention of a guardian or custodian, or to cause the same to be paid to a legal guardian or custodian of such minor or incompetent if one has been appointed or to cause the same to be used for the benefit of such minor or incompetent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the vested amount distributable to a minor or incompetent individual is equal to or in excess of one hundred thousand dollars 100,000), then no distribution shall be made on behalf of such individual except to a guardian appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any such payment shall fully discharge the Trustee, the Plan Sponsor, and the Plan from further liability on account thereof. 
 
 18.5 Missing Participants . If the Plan Administrator cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any Participant to whom a payment is due under the Plan, the Plan Administrator may direct that the payment and all remaining payments otherwise due to the Participant be cancelled on the records of the Plan and the amount thereof applied as a forfeiture in accordance with Sections 3.5 and 4.2 except that, in the event the Participant later notifies the Plan Administrator of his whereabouts and requests the payments due to him under the Plan, the forfeited amount shall be restored either from Trust income or by a special contribution by the Plan Sponsor to the Plan, as determined by the Plan Administrator, in an amount equal to the payment to be paid to the Participants. 
 
 ARTICLE 19 
 PROHIBITION AGAINST DIVERSION 
 
 At no time shall any part of the Fund be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of the Participants or their Beneficiaries, subject, however, to the payment of all taxes and administrative expenses and subject to the provisions of the Plan with respect to returns of contributions. Expenses incurred in the administration of the Plan shall be paid from the Trust, to the extent permitted by ERISA, unless such expenses are paid by the Plan Sponsor provided, further, that the Plan Sponsor may be reimbursed by the Fund, to the extent permitted by ERISA, for Plan expenses originally paid by the Plan Sponsor. 
 
 ARTICLE 20 
 LIMITATION OF RIGHTS 
 
 Participation in the Plan shall not give any Employee any right or claim except to the extent that such right is specifically fixed under the terms of the Plan. The adoption of the Plan and the Trust by any Plan Sponsor shall not be construed to give any Employee a right to be continued in the employ of a Plan Sponsor or as interfering with the right of a Plan Sponsor to terminate the employment of any Employee at any time. 
 
 ARTICLE 21 
 AMENDMENT TO OR TERMINATION OF THE 
 PLAN AND THE TRUST 
 
 21.1 Right of Primary Sponsor to Amend or Terminate . The Primary Sponsor reserves the right at any time to modify or amend or terminate the Plan or the Trust in whole or in part 
 62 

provided, however, that the Primary Sponsor shall have no power to modify or amend the Plan in such manner as would cause or permit any portion of the funds held under a Plan to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of Participants or their Beneficiaries, or as would cause or permit any portion of a fund held under the Plan to become the property of a Plan Sponsor and provided further, that the duties or liabilities of the Trustee shall not be modified without its written consent. No such modifications or amendments shall have the effect of retroactively changing or depriving Participants or Beneficiaries of rights already accrued under the Plan. No Plan Sponsor other than the Primary Sponsor shall have the right to so modify, amend or terminate the Plan or the Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Plan Sponsor may terminate its own participation in the Plan and Trust pursuant to the Plan. 
 
 21.2 Right of Plan Sponsor to Terminate Participation . Each Plan Sponsor other than the Primary Sponsor shall have the right to terminate its participation in the Plan and Trust by resolution of its board of directors or other appropriate governing body and notice in writing to the Primary Sponsor unless such termination would result in the disqualification of the Plan or the Trust or would adversely affect the exempt status of the Plan or the Trust as to any other Plan Sponsor. If contributions by or on behalf of a Plan Sponsor are completely terminated, the Plan and Trust shall be deemed terminated as to such Plan Sponsor. Any termination by a Plan Sponsor shall not be a termination as to any other Plan Sponsor. 
 
 21.3 Plan Termination . 
 
 (a) If the Plan is terminated by the Primary Sponsor, or if contributions to the Trust are permanently discontinued, it shall terminate as to all Plan Sponsors and the Fund shall be used, subject to the payment of expenses and taxes, for the benefit of Participants and Beneficiaries, and for no other purposes, and the Account of each affected Participant shall be fully vested and nonforfeitable, notwithstanding the provisions of the Section of the Plan which sets forth the vesting schedule. 
 
 (b) In the event of the partial termination of the Plan, each affected Participant s Account shall be fully vested and nonforfeitable, notwithstanding the provisions of the Section of the Plan which sets forth the vesting schedule. 
 
 21.4 Payments Upon Plan Termination . In the event of the termination of the Plan or the Trust with respect to a Plan Sponsor, the Accounts of the Participants with respect to the Plan as adopted by such Plan Sponsor shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Plan pursuant to the instructions of the Plan Administrator provided that the Trustee shall not be required to make any distribution until it receives a copy of an Internal Revenue Service determination letter to the effect that the termination does not affect the qualified status of the Plan or the exempt status of the Trust. 
 
 21.5 Plan Merger . In the case of any merger or consolidation of the Plan with, or any transfer of the assets or liabilities of the Plan to, any other plan qualified under Code Section 401, the terms of the merger, consolidation, or transfer shall be such that each Participant would receive (in the event of termination of the Plan or its successor immediately thereafter) a benefit which is no less than the benefit which the Participant would have received in the event of termination of the Plan immediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer. 
 63 

21.6 Optional Benefits . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, an amendment to the Plan 
 
 (a) which eliminates or reduces an early retirement benefit, if any, or which eliminates or reduces a retirement-type subsidy (as defined in Treasury Regulations), if any, or 
 
 (b) which eliminates an optional form of benefit (except to the extent otherwise provided in Treasury Regulations) 
 
 shall not be effective with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment is adopted. In the case of a retirement-type subsidy described in Subsection (a) above, this Section shall be applicable only to a Participant who satisfies, either before or after the amendment, the preamendment conditions for the subsidy. 
 
 ARTICLE 22 
 ADOPTION OF PLAN BY AFFILIATES 
 
 Any corporation or other business entity related to the Primary Sponsor by function or operation and any Affiliate, if the corporation, business entity or Affiliate is authorized to do so by written direction adopted by the Board of Directors, may adopt the Plan and the related Trust by action of the board of directors or other appropriate governing body of such corporation, business entity or Affiliate. Any adoption shall be evidenced by certified copies of the resolutions of the foregoing board of directors or governing body indicating the adoption and by the execution of the Trust by the adopting corporation, or business entity or Affiliate. The resolution shall state and define the effective date of the adoption of the Plan by the Plan Sponsor and, for the purpose of Code Section 415, the limitation year as to such Plan Sponsor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if the Plan and Trust as adopted by an Affiliate or other corporation or business entity under the foregoing provisions shall fail to receive the initial approval of the Internal Revenue Service as a Qualified Plan and Trust under Code Sections 401(a) and 501(a), any contributions by the Affiliate or other corporation or business entity after payment of all expenses will be returned to such Plan Sponsor free of any trust, and the Plan and Trust shall terminate, as to the adopting Affiliate or other corporation or business entity. 
 
 ARTICLE 23 
 QUALIFICATION AND RETURN OF CONTRIBUTIONS 
 
 23.1 Deductibility . 
 
 (a) All Plan Sponsor contributions to the Plan are contingent upon deductibility. To the extent permitted by the Code and other applicable laws and regulations thereunder, upon a Plan Sponsor s request, a contribution which was made by reason of a mistake of fact or which was nondeductible under Code Section 404, shall be returned to a Plan Sponsor within one (1) year after the payment of the contribution, or the disallowance of the deduction (to the extent disallowed), whichever is applicable. 
 
 64 

(b) In the event of a contribution which was made by reason of a mistake of fact or which was nondeductible, the amount to be returned to the Plan Sponsor shall be the excess of the contribution above the amount that would have been contributed had the mistake of fact or the mistake in determining the deduction not occurred, less any net loss attributable to the excess. Any net income attributable to the excess shall not be returned to the Plan Sponsor. No return of any portion of the excess shall be made to the Plan Sponsor if the return would cause the balance in a Participant s Account to be less than the balance would have been had the mistaken contribution not been made. 
 ARTICLE 24 
 ERISA ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND LIMITATION OF ACTIONS 
 
 24.1 Arbitration Requirement and Procedure . Subject to and without waiver of full compliance with the Plan s claims procedures as described in Article 17 which, to the extent applicable with regard to claims for benefits, must be exhausted with respect to any claim before any arbitration pursuant to this Article 24, all Covered Claims (as defined below) must be resolved exclusively pursuant to the provisions of this Article 24 (the Arbitration Procedure ). 
 
 (a) Covered Claims . Any claim made by or on behalf of an Employee (including a former Employee), Participant or Beneficiary (a Claimant which arises out of, relates to, or concerns the Plan or the Trust, including without limitation, any claim for benefits under the Plan or the Trust any claim asserting a breach of, or failure to follow, the Plan or Trust and any claim asserting a breach of, or failure to follow, any provision of ERISA or the Code, including without limitation claims for breach of fiduciary duty, ERISA Section 510 claims, and claims for failure to timely provide notices or information required by ERISA or the Code are Covered Claims , except that Covered Claims shall not include any claim for non-monetary injunctive relief, such as, without limitation, claims for removal of a fiduciary, or claims for mandatory, permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction. Covered Claims shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration administered in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes (the Rules of the American Arbitration Association AAA then in effect. Under no circumstances are the AAA Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations to be used. If the Covered Claims solely involve (i) claims under ERISA Section 502(a)(1)(B) to recover benefits due to the Claimant under the terms of the Plan, to enforce the Claimant s rights under the terms of the Plan, or to clarify the Claimant s rights to future benefits under the terms of the Plan, and or (ii) claims for penalties under ERISA Section 502(c), the Covered Claims shall be submitted to and decided by only one (1) arbitrator. For all other disputes, the Covered Claims shall be submitted to and decided by three (3) arbitrators. Claimant shall assert all Covered Claims in the same arbitration and shall not split Covered Claims. If, for example, a Claimant wishes to pursue both a claim for benefits under ERISA Section 502(a)(1)(B) and a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA Section 502(a)(2) and or ERISA Section 502(a)(3), the Claimant shall first exhaust the claims procedure described in Article 17 to the extent the claims procedure is applicable and then assert both claims in one arbitration demand. To the extent multiple Covered Claims are asserted in one arbitration demand 
 65 

and one or more of such Covered Claims would require consideration by three (3) arbitrators as provided in this Subsection, all Covered Claims asserted in such arbitration demand shall be submitted to and decided by three (3) arbitrators. 
 
 (b) No Group, Class, or Representative Arbitrations . All Covered Claims must be brought solely in the Claimant s individual capacity and not in a representative capacity or on a class, collective, or group basis. Each arbitration shall be limited solely to one Claimant s Covered Claims, and that Claimant may not seek or receive any remedy which has the purpose or effect of providing additional benefits or monetary relief (including, without limitation, damages, losses, surcharge, disgorgement, or penalties) to any person, including without limitation, any Eligible Employee, Participant or Beneficiary other than the Claimant. For instance, with respect to any claim brought under ERISA Section 502(a)(2) to seek appropriate relief under ERISA Section 409, the Claimant s remedy, if any, shall be limited to (1) the alleged losses to the Claimant s individual Account resulting from the alleged breach of fiduciary duty, (2) a pro-rated portion of any profits allegedly made by a fiduciary through the use of Plan assets where such pro-rated amount is intended to provide a remedy solely to Claimant s individual Account, and or (3) such other remedial or equitable relief as the arbitrator(s) deems proper so long as such remedial or equitable relief does not include or result in the provision of additional benefits or monetary relief to any person, including without limitation, any Eligible Employee, Participant or Beneficiary other than the Claimant, and is not binding on the Plan Administrator or Trustee with respect to any Eligible Employee, Participant or Beneficiary other than the Claimant. The requirement that (x) all Covered Claims be brought solely in a Claimant s individual capacity and not in a purported group, class, collective, or representative capacity, and (y) that no Claimant shall be entitled to receive, and shall not be awarded, any relief other than individual relief, shall govern irrespective of any AAA rule or decision to the contrary and is a material and non-severable term of this Article 24. The arbitrator(s) shall consequently have no jurisdiction or authority to compel or permit any group, class, collective, or representative action in arbitration, to consolidate different arbitration proceedings, or to join any other party to any arbitration. Any dispute or issue as to the applicability or validity of this Subsection (b) (the Class Action Waiver shall be determined solely by the court designated in Section 24.2. Moreover, nothing in this Arbitration Procedure shall preclude seeking interim or provisional relief or remedies in aid of arbitration from such court. In the event a court were to find these requirements to be unenforceable or invalid, then the entire Arbitration Procedure (i.e., all of this Article 24) shall be rendered null and void in all respects as to the particular claim that is the subject of the court s ruling. 
 
 (c) Selection of Arbitrator . The arbitrator(s) shall be mutually acceptable to all parties to the dispute and must be attorney(s) with prior experience with ERISA claims. The arbitrator(s) need not be selected from the AAA s panel of arbitrators if the parties to the dispute can reach agreement on the selection of the arbitrator(s). If, however, the parties cannot agree on the selection of the arbitrator(s) within twenty-one (21) days following the demand for arbitration, then the arbitrator(s) shall be selected 
 66 

pursuant to the Rules provided, however, that (1) the list of potential arbitrators provided by the AAA shall be limited to attorneys with prior experience with ERISA claims (2) for an arbitration to be heard by one arbitrator, the AAA shall provide a list of names of seven (7) potential arbitrators from which the two sides (Claimant on one side and all Respondents on the other side) shall alternatively strike names until only one name remains, with the Claimant striking first and (3) for an arbitration to be heard by three (3) arbitrators, the AAA shall provide a list of names of eleven (11) potential arbitrators from which the two sides shall alternatively strike names until only one name remains, with the Claimant striking first. 
 
 (d) Location and Administration of Arbitration . The arbitration proceedings shall be held in Ridgeland, Mississippi or at such other place as may be selected by mutual agreement of the parties. A Claimant may initiate arbitration by serving a demand for arbitration on the Plan Administrator and, if applicable, the Trustee, or any other respondent, and by filing such demand for arbitration with the appropriate office of the AAA. In order to save time and expenses, the parties may agree to have the arbitrator(s), and not the AAA, administer the arbitration. In the absence of such an agreement, however, the AAA will administer the arbitration. 
 
 (e) Limitation on Actions . Any Covered Claim must be submitted to arbitration within the earlier of the applicable statutory period of limitations or three (3) years following the date on which the Covered Claim accrued or it shall be barred as untimely provided, however, any Covered Claim under ERISA Section 502(a)(1)(B) for a denial of benefits shall be deemed to have accrued on the date the Plan Administrator s final denial is issued under the Plan s claims procedure, and any demand for arbitration involving such a claim shall be served on the Plan Administrator and, if applicable, the Trustee, and filed with the AAA within twelve (12) months following the date on which the final denial of claim is issued by the Plan Administrator. 
 
 (f) Arbitrator s Standard of Review . For any Covered Claim to recover benefits under ERISA Section 502(a)(1)(B), the arbitrator(s) review of the Plan Administrator s claim final denial shall be limited to a review of the administrative record as submitted to the Plan Administrator, and the Plan Administrator s determination may only be overturned if the arbitrator(s) determine that the Plan Administrator s decision was arbitrary and capricious. Subject to that limitation, the arbitrator(s) shall have the discretion to order such discovery as permitted under the Rules. All disputes regarding discovery shall be decided by the arbitrator(s). With respect to the arbitrator(s) review of all other types of Covered Claims, the arbitrator(s) are to adjudicate the Covered Claims in accordance with the applicable law. 
 
 (g) Arbitration Award . The arbitration award shall be in writing. In rendering the award, the arbitrator(s) shall determine the respective rights and obligations of the parties under federal law, or, if federal law is not applicable, the laws of the State of Mississippi. The arbitration award shall be binding on all parties solely with respect to the Claimant s individual claims, and it shall have no effect with respect to claims of any 
 67 

other person, including without limitation, any Eligible Employee, Participant or Beneficiary, other than the Claimant. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no application or appeal to any court may be made in connection with any question of law arising in the course of arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Procedure or with respect to any award, except as to (1) the Class Action Waiver, (2) actions relating to enforcement of this Arbitration Procedure (3) any award seeking interim or other provisional relief or remedies in aid of arbitration or (4) any action permitted under the Federal Arbitration Act, U.S.C. Section 1, et. seq. FAA ). For those issues permitted in the preceding sentence, such an application or appeal may be made solely to the court designated in Section 24.2. 
 
 (h) Fees and Expenses . Except as may be awarded by the arbitrator(s) in a final award (1) the fees and expenses of the arbitrator(s) and arbitration shall be advanced by the Primary Sponsor and (2) each party shall bear the expense of his, her or its own counsel, experts, witnesses, and preparation and presentation of evidence. The arbitrator(s) may include in his, her, or their final award an award of arbitration fees and expenses and or attorneys fees and expenses to the extent allowed under ERISA. However, if any party prevails on a statutory claim that entitles the prevailing party to attorneys fees and costs, or if there is a written agreement between the parties providing for attorneys fees and costs, the arbitrator(s) may award reasonable attorneys fees and costs in accordance with the applicable statute or written agreement. In that event, the arbitrator(s) shall resolve any dispute as to the reasonableness of any fee or cost that may be awarded. 
 
 (i) Confidentiality . Neither the Claimant nor the arbitrator(s) may disclose the existence, content, subject matter, or results of any arbitration proceeding without the prior written consent of the Primary Sponsor, and, as applicable, the Trustee or other arbitration respondent. This nondisclosure provision shall apply to all aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including without limitation, discovery, testimony, other evidence, briefs, and the award. In the event of a breach or threatened breach of this confidentiality provision, the Primary Sponsor or, if applicable, the Trustee or other arbitration respondent, may seek temporary, preliminary and or permanent injunctive relief to prevent such breach or threatened breach, as well as any damages suffered by the Primary Sponsor, Plan Administrator, Trustee, or other arbitration respondent. In the event the Primary Sponsor or, if applicable, the Trustee or other arbitration respondent, brings an action to enforce this confidentiality provision and receives any remedy (whether temporary or permanent), the Claimant or arbitrator responsible for the breach or threatened breach shall pay the attorneys fees and expenses in connection with the enforcement action. In any action to confirm or set aside the arbitration award, the parties shall cooperatively seek to file the arbitration award under seal or for an in camera inspection by the court without the award being filed in the public record. 
 
 (j) Arbitrator Independence . The parties intend that the arbitrator(s) be independent and impartial. To this end, the arbitrator(s) shall disclose to the parties, both 
 68 

before and during the arbitration proceedings, any professional, family, or social relationships, past or present, with any party or counsel. 
 
 (k) Applicable Law . This Arbitration Procedure shall be governed and enforced under ERISA, the FAA, and, to the extent that it does not conflict with ERISA or the FAA, the laws of the State of Mississippi. The final award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on the parties to the arbitration with respect to the Claimant s individual claims only. 
 
 (l) Covered Claims Against Non-Fiduciaries . This Arbitration Procedure shall apply to all Covered Claims asserted by a Claimant, whether such Covered Claims are asserted solely against one or more of the Plan s fiduciaries or former fiduciaries or are also asserted against any non-fiduciary (e.g., a Plan service provider). 
 
 24.2 Restriction on Venue . If a Claimant wishes to pursue any Covered Claim, that Claimant shall comply with the Arbitration Procedure, set forth in this Article 24, and shall not file any such claim in a state or federal court. To the extent, however, any Claimant fails or refuses to comply with the Arbitration Procedure, wishes to challenge the legal enforceability of the Arbitration Procedure, or to the extent the Arbitration Procedure is invalidated, such action or challenge shall be filed exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, which is where the Plan is administered. In the event a Claimant makes an unsuccessful challenge to the validity, enforceability or scope of the Arbitration Procedure in any court, the Claimant shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, reimburse the defendants in that action for all attorneys fees, costs, and expenses incurred by them in defending against the Claimant s unsuccessful court challenge.

 SECTION 1 
 
 Except to the extent permitted under Section 3.1(c), if applicable, the annual addition for any Participant for any one limitation year may not exceed the lesser of 
 
 (a) 66,000 (for 2023), as adjusted under Code Section 415(d) or 
 
 (b) 100 of the Participant s Annual Compensation (as modified by this Appendix A). 
 
 The limit described in Subsection (b) shall not apply to any contribution for medical benefits after separation from service (within the meaning of Code Section 401(h) or 419A(f)(2)) which is otherwise treated as an annual addition. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, at such times as the Primary Sponsor does not maintain an effective election under Subchapter S of the Code, if no more than one-third (1 3) of the Plan Sponsor contributions to the Plan for the limitation year which are deductible under Code Section 404(a)(9) are allocated to Highly Compensated Employees, the annual addition shall not include forfeitures of Company Stock acquired with the proceeds of an Acquisition Loan or Plan Sponsor contributions applied to the payment of interest on an Acquisition Loan. Furthermore, the amount of any qualified gratuitous transfer (as defined in Code Section 664(g)(1)) allocated to a Participant for any limitation year is not taken into account in determining whether any other annual addition exceeds the limitations imposed by Code Section 415, provided that the amount of the qualified gratuitous transfer does not exceed the limitations imposed by Code Section 415. 
 SECTION 2 
 
 For the purposes of this Appendix A, the term annual addition for any Participant means for any limitation year, the sum of Plan Sponsor contributions and forfeitures to the Plan, Participant contributions to any individual medical account (as defined in Code Section 415(1)(2) or 419A(d)) which is part of the Plan, and other amounts as determined in Code Section 415(c)(2) in effect for that limitation year. Participant contributions shall be determined without regard to rollover amounts, employee contributions to a simplified employee pension which are excludable from gross income under Code Section 401(k)(6), and catch up contributions as described in Code Section 414(v). 
 If an Acquisition Loan has been made to the Plan, annual additions for a limitation year include Plan Sponsor contributions of both principal and interest used to repay the Acquisition Loan for the limitation year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Fair Market Value of the shares of Company Stock released from the Loan Suspense Account and allocated to the Participants Company Stock Subaccounts for the limitation year may be used in calculating annual additions, in lieu of Plan Sponsor contributions used to repay an Acquisition Loan, if the 
 1 

Fair Market Value of the shares of Company Stock released from the Loan Suspense Account is less than Plan Sponsor contributions used to repay the Acquisition Loan. 
 SECTION 3 
 
 For purposes of this Appendix A, the term limitation year shall mean a Plan Year. 
 
 SECTION 4 
 
 For purposes of this Appendix A, Annual Compensation shall include compensation paid to the Participant by the later of (i) 2 months after the Participant s severance from employment with the Plan Sponsor, or (ii) the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the Participant s severance from employment with the Plan Sponsor, if the payment is for unused bona fide sick, vacation, or other leave (but only if the Participant would have been able to use the leave if employment had continued), difficulty of care payments (within the meaning of Code Section 131(c)) or the payment is received by a Participant pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan (but only if the payment would have been paid to the Participant at the same time if the Participant had continued in employment with the Plan Sponsor and only to the extent that the payment is includable in the Participant s gross income). Any payments made after the Participant s severance from employment not described in this Section 4 of Appendix A shall not be included in Annual Compensation. 
 
 SECTION 5 
 
 For purposes of applying the limitations of this Appendix A, all defined contribution plans maintained or deemed to be maintained by a Plan Sponsor shall be treated as one defined contribution plan. In the event any corrective actions are required to be taken with respect to this Plan or with respect to another defined contribution plan pursuant to any program described in Section 16.9 of the Plan as a result of the annual additions of a Participant exceeding the limitations set forth in Section 1 of this Appendix A and Code Section 415, because of the Participant s participation in more than one defined contribution plan, such actions shall be taken first with regard to the other defined contribution plans maintained by a Plan Sponsor, then with respect to the 401(k) Plan, and finally with respect to the ESOP Plan. The Plan Sponsor shall correct any excess annual additions in accordance with the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System, as set forth in Revenue Procedure 2021-30, or any successor guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service. 
 SECTION 6 
 
 The provisions of this Appendix A shall be construed in a manner consistent with the provisions of final Treasury Regulations issued under Code Section 415 and any successor guidance.

 USA.605904107.14 VVL 

(ii) the Required Aggregation Group, when included in every potential combination, if any, with any or all of the plans of the Plan Sponsor and its Affiliates which are not part of the Required Aggregation Group and which qualify under Code Section 401(a), is part of a Top-Heavy Group (as defined in Paragraph (2) of this Subsection (d)). 
 (C) For purposes of Subparagraphs (A)(ii) and (B)(ii) of this Paragraph (1), any combination of plans must satisfy the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(4) and 410.

 (A) the sum, as of the Determination Date, of the present value of the cumulative accrued benefits for all Key Employees under all plans included in such group exceeds 
 (B) sixty percent (60 of a similar sum determined for all participants in such plans. 
 (3) (A) For purposes of this Subsection (d), the present value of the accrued benefit for any participant in a defined contribution plan as of any Determination Date or last day of a plan year shall be the sum of 
 (i) as to any defined contribution plan other than a simplified employee pension, the account balance as of the most recent valuation date occurring within the plan year ending on the Determination Date or last day of a plan year,

For purposes of this Subparagraph (B) the valuation date must be the same valuation date used for computing plan costs for minimum funding, regardless of whether a valuation is performed that year. The actuarial assumptions utilized in calculating the present value of the accrued benefit for any participant in a defined benefit plan for purposes of this Subparagraph (B) shall be established by the Plan Administrator after consultation with the actuary for the plan, and shall be reasonable in the aggregate and shall comport with the requirements set forth by the Internal Revenue Service in Q&A T-26 and T-27 of Treasury Regulation Section 1.416-1. 
 (C) For purposes of determining the present value of the cumulative accrued benefit under a plan for any Participant in accordance with this Subsection (d), the present value shall be increased by the aggregate distributions made with respect to the Participant (including distributions paid on account of death to the extent they do not exceed the present value of the cumulative accrued benefit existing immediately prior to death) under each plan being considered and under any terminated plan which if it had not been terminated would have been in a Required Aggregation Group with the Plan during the one-year period ending on the Determination Date or the last day of the Plan Year that falls within the calendar year in which the Determination Date falls. In the case of a distribution made for a reason other than severance from employment, death, or disability, this provision shall be applied by substituting five-year period for one-year period .

(D) For purposes of this Paragraph (3), participant contributions which are deductible as qualified retirement contributions within the meaning of Code Section 219 or any successor, as adjusted to reflect income, gains, losses, and other credits or charges attributable thereto, shall not be considered to be part of the accrued benefits under any plan. 
 (E) For purposes of this Paragraph (3), if any employee is not a Key Employee with respect to any plan for any plan year, but such employee was a Key Employee with respect to such plan for any prior plan year, any accrued benefit for such employee shall not be taken into account. 
 (F) For purposes of this Paragraph (3), if any Employee has not performed any service for the Plan Sponsor or Affiliate during the one-year period ending on the Determination Date, any accrued benefit for that Employee shall not be taken into account. 
 (G) (i) In the case of an unrelated rollover (as defined below) between plans which qualify under Code Section 401(a), (a) the plan providing the distribution shall count the distribution as a distribution under Subparagraph (C) of this Paragraph (3), and (b) the plan accepting the distribution shall not consider the distribution part of the accrued benefit under this Section and 
 (ii) in the case of a related rollover (as defined below) between plans which qualify under Code Section 401(a), (a) the plan providing the distribution shall not count the distribution as a distribution under Subparagraph (C) of this Paragraph (3), and (b) the plan accepting the distribution shall consider the distribution part of the accrued benefit under this Section. 
 For purposes of this Subparagraph (G), an unrelated rollover is a rollover as defined in Code Section 402(c)(4) or 408(d)(3) or a plan-to-plan transfer which is both initiated by the participant and made from a plan maintained by one employer to a plan maintained by another employer where the employers are not Affiliates. For purposes of this Subparagraph (G), a related rollover is a rollover as defined in Code Section 402(c)(4) or 408(d)(3) or a plan-to-plan transfer which is either not initiated by the participant or made to a plan maintained by the employer or an Affiliate.

APPENDIX C 
 SPECIAL NONDISCRIMINATION RULES 
 
 The Plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 401(k)(12) with respect to contributions under Section 3.1 and Code Section 401(m)(11) with respect to contributions under Section 3.2. The Plan Sponsor will make Matching Contributions pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Plan to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.401(k)-3 and 1.401(m)-3. Accordingly, this Appendix C is not applicable unless and until the Plan is further amended to provide otherwise. 
 SECTION 1 
 
 As used in this Appendix, the following words shall have the following meanings 
 
 (a) Eligible Participant means a Participant who is an Employee during any particular Plan Year. 
 
 (b) Highly Compensated Eligible Participant means any Eligible Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee. 
 
 (c) Matching Contributions means any contribution made by a Plan Sponsor to a Matching Account and any other contribution made to a plan by a Plan Sponsor or an Affiliate on behalf of an Employee on account of a contribution made by an Employee or on account of an Elective Deferral. 
 
 (d) Qualified Matching Contributions means Matching Contributions which are immediately nonforfeitable when made, and which would be nonforfeitable, regardless of the age or service of the Employee or whether the Employee is employed on a certain date, and which may not be distributed, except upon one of the events described under Code Section 401(k)(2)(B) and the regulations thereunder. 
 
 (e) Qualified Nonelective Contributions means contributions of the Plan Sponsor or an Affiliate, other than Matching Contributions or Elective Deferrals, which are nonforfeitable when made, and which would be nonforfeitable regardless of the age or service of the Employee or whether the Employee is employed on a certain date, and which may not be distributed, except upon one of the events described under Code Section 401(k)(2)(B) and the regulations thereunder. 
 
 SECTION 2 
 
 In addition to any other limitations set forth in the Plan, for each Plan Year one of the following tests must be satisfied 
 
 (a) the actual deferral percentage for the Highly Compensated Eligible Participants for the Plan Year must not be more than the actual deferral percentage of all other Eligible Participants for the preceding Plan Year multiplied by 1.25 or 
 
 C-1 
 USA.605904107.14 VVL 

(b) the excess of the actual deferral percentage for the Highly Compensated Eligible Participants for the Plan Year over that of all other Eligible Participants for the preceding Plan Year must not be more than two (2) percentage points, and the actual deferral percentage for the Highly Compensated Eligible Participants for the Plan Year must not be more than the actual deferral percentage of all other Eligible Participants for the preceding Plan Year multiplied by two (2). 
 
 The actual deferral percentage for the Highly Compensated Eligible Participants and all other Eligible Participants for a Plan Year is the average in each group of the ratios, calculated separately for each Employee, of the Deferral Amounts contributed by the Plan Sponsor on behalf of an Employee for the Plan Year to the Annual Compensation of the Employee in the Plan Year. In addition, for purposes of calculating the actual deferral percentage as described above, Deferral Amounts of Employees who are not Highly Compensated Employees which are prohibited by Code Section 401(a)(30) shall not be taken into consideration. Except to the extent limited by Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(k)-2(a)(6) and any other applicable regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury, all or part of the Qualified Matching Contributions and Qualified Nonelective Contributions (other than Qualified Nonelective Contributions that are treated as Matching Contributions pursuant to Section 5 of this Appendix C) made pursuant to the Plan may be treated as Deferral Amounts for purposes of determining the actual deferral percentage. The Plan Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, contribute Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions with respect to a Plan Year, provided the contributions are made no later than the last day of the Plan Year following the Plan Year for which the Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions are made. 
 
 SECTION 3 
 
 If the Deferral Amounts contributed on behalf of any Highly Compensated Eligible Participant exceed the amount permitted under the actual deferral percentage test described in Section 2 of this Appendix C for any given Plan Year, then before the end of the Plan Year following the Plan Year for which the Excess Deferral Amount was contributed, (a) the portion of the Excess Deferral Amount for the Plan Year attributable to a Highly Compensated Eligible Participant, as adjusted in accordance with Code Section 401(k) and applicable Treasury Regulations to reflect income, gain, or loss attributable to it and reduced by any excess Elective Deferrals as determined pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Plan previously distributed to a Participant for the Participant s taxable year ending with or within the Plan Year, may be distributed to the Highly Compensated Eligible Participant or (b) to the extent provided in regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Plan Administrator may permit the Participant to elect, within two and one-half (2 months after the end of the Plan Year for which the Excess Deferral Amount was contributed, to treat the Excess Deferral Amount, unadjusted for earnings, gains, and losses, but as so reduced, as an amount distributed to the Participant and then contributed as an after-tax contribution by the Participant to the Plan recharacterized amounts ). The income, gain, or loss allocable to such Excess Deferral Amount shall be determined in a similar manner as described in Article 4 of the Plan or in any other manner permitted by applicable Treasury Regulations. The Excess Deferral Amount to be distributed or recharacterized shall be reduced by Deferral Amounts previously distributed or recharacterized for the taxable year ending in the same Plan Year, and shall also be reduced by Deferral Amounts previously distributed or recharacterized for the Plan Year beginning in such taxable year. For all other purposes under 
 C-2 
 USA.605904107.14 VVL 

the Plan other than this Appendix C recharacterized amounts shall continue to be treated as Deferral Amounts. The portion of the Matching Contribution on which such Excess Deferral Amount was based shall be forfeited upon the distribution or recharacterization, as the case may be, of such Excess Deferral Amount. 
 
 (a) For purposes of this Section 3, Excess Deferral Amount means, with respect to a Plan Year, the excess of 
 
 (1) the aggregate amount of Deferral Amounts contributed by a Plan Sponsor on behalf of Highly Compensated Eligible Participants for the Plan Year, over 
 
 (2) the maximum amount of Deferral Amounts permitted under Section 2 of this Appendix C for the Plan Year, which shall be determined by reducing the Deferral Amounts contributed on behalf of Highly Compensated Eligible Participants in order of the actual deferral percentages beginning with the highest of such percentages. 
 
 (b) Distribution of the Excess Deferral Amount for any Plan Year shall be made to Highly Compensated Eligible Participants on the basis of the dollar amount of Deferral Amounts attributable to each Highly Compensated Eligible Participant. The Plan Sponsor shall determine the amount of Excess Deferral Amounts which shall be distributed to each Highly Compensated Eligible Participant as follows. 
 
 (1) The Deferral Amounts allocated to the Highly Compensated Eligible Participant with the highest dollar amount of Deferral Amounts for the Plan Year shall be reduced by the amount required to cause that Highly Compensated Eligible Participant s remaining Deferral Amounts for the Plan Year to be equal to the dollar amount of the Deferral Amounts allocated to the Highly Compensated Eligible Participant with the next highest dollar amount of Deferral Amounts for the Plan Year. This amount is then distributed to the Highly Compensated Eligible Participant with the highest dollar amount of Deferral Amounts, unless a smaller reduction, when added to the total dollar amount already distributed pursuant to this Paragraph (1), equals the total Excess Deferral Amounts. 
 
 (2) If the total amount distributed under Paragraph (1) of this Subsection (b) is less than the total Excess Deferral Amounts, the procedure in Paragraph (1) shall be successively repeated until the total dollar amount distributed is equal to the total Excess Deferral Amounts attributable to Highly Compensated Eligible Participants. 
 
 If a distribution of the Excess Deferral Amounts attributable to the Highly Compensated Eligible Participants is made in accordance with Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Subsection (b), the limitations in Section 2 of this Appendix C shall be treated as being met regardless of whether the actual deferral percentage, if recalculated after such distributions, would have satisfied the requirements of Section 2 of this Appendix C. 
 C-3 
 USA.605904107.14 VVL 

SECTION 4 
 
 The Plan Administrator shall have the responsibility of monitoring the Plan s compliance with the limitations of this Appendix C and shall have the power to take all steps it deems necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance, including, without limitation, restricting the amount which Highly Compensated Eligible Participants can elect to have contributed pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Plan. Any actions taken by the Plan Administrator pursuant to this Section 4 shall be pursuant to non-discriminatory procedures consistently applied. 
 
 SECTION 5 
 
 The contribution percentage for Eligible Participants who are not Highly Compensated Eligible Participants for the Plan Year shall be equal to the contribution percentage for Eligible Participants who are not Highly Compensated Eligible Participants for such Plan Year shall be equal to the contribution percentage for that Plan Year calculated in the manner described below. 
 
 In addition to any other limitations set forth in the Plan, Matching Contributions under the Plan and the amount of nondeductible employee contributions under the Plan, for each Plan Year must satisfy one of the following tests 
 
 (a) The contribution percentage for Highly Compensated Eligible Participants for the Plan Year must not exceed 125 of the contribution percentage for all other Eligible Participants for the preceding Plan Year or 
 
 (b) The contribution percentage for Highly Compensated Eligible Participants for the Plan Year must not exceed the lesser of (1) 200 of the contribution percentage for all other Eligible Participants for the preceding Plan Year or (2) the contribution percentage for all other Eligible Participants for the preceding Plan Year plus two (2) percentage points. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Section 5, the terms Highly Compensated Eligible Participant and Eligible Participant shall not include any Participant who is not eligible to receive a Matching Contribution under the provisions of the Plan, other than as a result of the Participant failing to contribute to the Plan or failing to have an Elective Deferral contributed to the Plan on the Participant s behalf. The contribution percentage for Highly Compensated Eligible Participants and for all other Eligible Participants for a Plan Year shall be the average of the ratios, calculated separately for each Participant, of (A) to (B), where (A) is the amount of Matching Contributions under the Plan (excluding Qualified Matching Contributions which are used to apply the test set forth in Section 2 of this Appendix C) and nondeductible employee contributions made under the Plan for the Eligible Participant for the Plan Year, and where (B) is the Annual Compensation of the Eligible Participant for the Plan Year. Except to the extent limited by Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(m)-2(a)(6) and any other applicable regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury, a Plan Sponsor may elect to treat Deferral Amounts and Qualified Nonelective Contributions as Matching Contributions for purpose of determining the contribution percentage, provided the Deferral Amounts, excluding those treated as Matching Contributions, satisfy the test set forth in Section 2 of this Appendix C. The Plan 
 C-4 
 USA.605904107.14 VVL 

Sponsor may in its sole discretion contribute Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions with respect to a Plan Year, provided the contributions are made no later than the last day of the Plan Year following the Plan for which the Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions are made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Qualified Nonelective Contributions and Qualified Matching Contributions that are taken into account for purposes of applying the test contained in Section 2 of this Appendix C shall not be taken into account under this Section 5. 
 
 SECTION 6 
 
 If either (a) the Matching Contributions and, if taken into account under Section 5 of this Appendix C, the Deferral Amounts, Qualified Nonelective Contributions and or Qualified Matching Contributions made on behalf of Highly Compensated Eligible Participants, or (b) the nondeductible employee contributions made by Highly Compensated Eligible Participants exceed the amount permitted under the contribution percentage test for any given Plan Year, then, before the close of the Plan Year following the Plan Year for which the Excess Aggregate Contributions were made, the amount of the Excess Aggregate Contributions attributable to the Plan for the Plan Year, as adjusted in accordance with Code Section 401(m) and applicable Treasury Regulations to reflect any income, gain, or loss attributable to such contributions shall be distributed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Appendix C, or, if the Excess Aggregate Contributions are forfeitable, forfeited. The income allocable to such contributions shall be determined in a similar manner as described in Article 4 of the Plan. As to any Highly Compensated Employee, any distribution or forfeiture of his allocable portion of the Excess Aggregate Contributions for a Plan Year shall first be attributed to any nondeductible employee contributions made by the Participant during the Plan Year for which no corresponding Plan Sponsor contribution is made and then to any remaining nondeductible employee contributions made by the Participant during the Plan Year and any Matching Contributions thereon. As between the Plan and any other plan or plans maintained by the Plan Sponsor in which Excess Aggregate Contributions for a Plan Year are held, each such plan shall distribute or forfeit a pro-rata share of each class of contribution based on the respective amounts of a class of contribution made to each plan during the Plan Year. The payment of the Excess Aggregate Contributions shall be made without regard to any other provision in the Plan. 
 
 For purposes of this Section 6, with respect to any Plan Year, Excess Aggregate Contributions means the excess of 
 
 (a) the aggregate amount of the Matching Contributions and nondeductible employee contributions (and any Qualified Nonelective Contributions or Qualified Matching Contributions) and, it taken into account under Section 5 of this Appendix C, the Deferral Amounts actually made on behalf of Highly Compensated Eligible Participants for the Plan Year, over 
 
 (b) the maximum amount of contributions permitted under the limitations of Section 5 of this Appendix C, determined by reducing contributions made on behalf of Highly Compensated Eligible Participants in order of their contribution percentages beginning with the highest of such percentages. 
 C-5 
 USA.605904107.14 VVL 

The determination of the amount of Excess Aggregate Contributions under this Section 6 shall be made after (1) first determining the excess Elective Deferrals under Section 3.1(b) of the Plan and (2) then determining the Excess Deferral Amounts under Section 3 of this Appendix C. 
 
 (c) Distribution or forfeiture of nondeductible employee contributions or Matching Contributions in the amount of the Excess Aggregate Contributions for any Plan Year shall be made with respect to Highly Compensated Eligible Participants on the basis of the dollar amount of the Excess Aggregate Contributions attributable to each Highly Compensated Eligible Participant. Forfeitures of Excess Aggregate Contributions may not be allocated to Participants whose contributions are reduced under this Section 6. The Plan Sponsor shall determine the amount of Excess Aggregate Contributions which shall be distributed to each Highly Compensated Eligible Participant as follows. 
 
 (1) The Matching Contributions and nondeductible contributions allocated to the Highly Compensated Eligible Participant with the highest dollar amount of such contributions for the Plan Year shall be reduced by the amount required to cause that Highly Compensated Eligible Participant s remaining Matching Contributions and nondeductible contributions for the Plan Year to be equal to the dollar amount of such contributions allocated to the Highly Compensated Eligible Participant with the next highest dollar amount of Matching contributions and nondeductible contributions for the Plan Year. This amount is then distributed to the Highly Compensated Eligible Participant with the highest dollar amount of Matching Contributions and nondeductible contributions, unless a smaller reduction, when added to the total dollar amount already distributed pursuant to this Paragraph (1), equals the total Excess Aggregate Contributions. 
 
 (2) If the total amount distributed under Paragraph (1) is less than the total Excess Aggregate Contributions, the procedure in Paragraph (1) shall be repeated until the total dollar amount of Matching Contributions and nondeductible contributions distributed is equal to the total Excess Aggregate Contributions attributable to Highly Compensated Eligible Participants. 
 
 If a distribution of the total Excess Aggregate Contributions is made in accordance with Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Subsection (c), the limitations in Section 5 of this Appendix C shall be treated as being met regardless of whether the actual contribution percentage, if recalculated after such distributions, would have satisfied the requirements of Section 5 of this Appendix C. 
 
 SECTION 7 
 
 Except to the extent limited by rules promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury, if a Highly Compensated Eligible Participant is a participant in any other plan of the Plan Sponsor or any Affiliate which includes Matching Contributions, deferrals under a cash or deferred 
 C-6 
 USA.605904107.14 VVL 

arrangement pursuant to Code Section 401(k), or nondeductible employee contributions, any contributions made by or on behalf of the Participant to the other plan shall be allocated with the same class of contributions under the Plan for purposes of determining the actual deferral percentage and contribution percentage under the Plan. 
 Except to the extent limited by rules promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury, if the Plan and any other plans which include Matching Contributions, deferrals under a cash or deferred arrangement pursuant to Code Section 401(k), or nondeductible employee contributions are considered as one plan for purposes of Code Section 401(a)(4) and 410(b)(1), any contributions under the other plans shall be allocated with the same class of contributions under the Plan for purposes of determining the contribution percentage and actual deferral percentage under the Plan.

Plan Sponsor contributions and earnings must be accounted for separately by the ESOP Plan until the Acquisition Loan is repaid. 
 
 5. Effective January 1, 2025, by deleting and replacing the header language of Section 8.1 of the Plan in its entirety as follows 
 
 8.1 Hardship Withdrawals . The Trustee shall, upon the direction of the Plan Administrator, withdrawal all or a portion of the vested portion of the Participant s vested Account in his 401(k) Deferral Account, 401(k) Rollover Account, Roth Elective Deferral Account consisting of Deferral Amounts (but not earnings thereon), Roth Rollover Account, ESOP Deferral Account, and ESOP Rollover Account (including earnings) prior to the time such accounts are otherwise distributable in accordance with the other provisions of the Plan provided, however, that any such withdrawal shall be made only if the Participant is an Employee and demonstrates that he is suffering from hardship as determined herein. In addition, a single hardship withdrawal shall be made available from all subaccounts under the 401(k) Plan or from all available subaccounts under the ESOP Plan, but not a combination of both.

7. Effective January 1, 2025, by deleting and replacing Section 8.3(b) of the Plan in its entirety as follows

 9. Effective January 1, 2025, by adding the following sentence to the end of Section 13.1(c)(3) 
 
 For purposes of Section 13.3(a) and (b), the Participant s Roth Account and the Participant s other Accounts are treated as accounts under two separate plans (within the meaning of Code Section 414(l)) regarding the automatic rollover rules for mandatory distributions under Code Section 401(a)(31)(B)(i)(I) and the special rules in A-9 through A-11 of Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)(31)-1. 
 
 10. Effective January 1, 2025, by adding the following paragraph to Section 13.3 of the Plan immediately following Section 13.3(b) as follows 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Direct Rollover of a distribution from a Roth Elective Deferral Account, Roth In-Plan Conversion Account and or Roth Rollover Account under the Plan will only be made to another designated Roth account under an applicable retirement plan described in Code Section 401A(e)(1) or to a Roth IRA described in Code Section 408A, and only to the extent the rollover is permitted under the rules of Code Section 402(c) and applicable regulations. Any distribution from a Participant s Roth Account, Roth In-Plan Conversion Account or Roth Rollover Account will not be taken into account in determining whether distributions from a Participant s other Accounts are reasonably expected to total than 200 during a year. Furthermore, the provision that allows a Participant to directly roll over a portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution to an Eligible Retirement Plan if the amount rolled over exceeds 500 is applied by treating any amount distributed from the Participant s Roth Account, Roth In-Plan Conversion and or Roth Rollover Account as a separate distribution from any amount distributed from the Participant s other Accounts in the Plan, even if the amounts are distributed at the same time. 
 
 11. Effective January 1, 2025, by adding new Sections 13.7 and 13.8 to the Plan as follows 
 
 615260243.3 

13.7 Roth In-Plan Rollovers . A Participant may elect at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator to make a Direct Rollover of any vested amount in the Participant s Account (other than amounts credited to his Roth Elective Deferral Account or Roth Rollover Account) that is not otherwise distributable or any distribution under the Plan that is an Eligible Rollover Distribution to the Roth In-Plan Conversion Account established under the Plan for such Participant. Roth In-Plan Conversion Amounts will be credited to the Participant s Roth In-Plan Conversion Account. The Plan will maintain a record of amounts in each Participant s Roth In-Plan Conversion Account. Gains, losses and other credits or charges must be separately allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to each Participant s Roth In-Plan Conversion Account and the Participant s other Accounts under the Plan. Roth In-Plan Conversion Accounts are invested among the available Investment Funds in accordance with Article 6. No amounts other than Roth In-Plan Conversion Amounts and properly attributable earnings will be credited to each Participant s Roth In-Plan Conversion Account. A Participant may withdraw all or any portion of his Roth In-Plan Conversion Account maintained under the Plan by submitting a request in the form and subject to such rules as the Plan Administrator may from time to time prescribe. 
 
 13.8 Withdrawals and Distributions of Roth Elective Deferrals . Any withdrawal or distribution of a Participant s Roth Elective Deferral Account, Roth In-Plan Conversion Account or Roth Rollover Account will be subject to the distribution rules of Code Section 402A(d) and any applicable guidance or regulations issued thereunder and such procedures as the Plan Administrator may prescribe that are consistent therewith. 
 
 12. By deleting and replacing Section 15 of the Plan in its entirety as follows 
 
 15.1 Voting Provisions . The Trustee shall have discretionary authority under the Trust to vote all Company Stock held by it as part of the ESOP Plan assets, except as otherwise provided in this Section 15.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any agreement entered into by the Trust provides for voting of any shares of Company Stock pledged as security for any obligation of the ESOP Plan, then such shares of Company Stock shall be voted in accordance with such agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Primary Sponsor has a registration-type class of securities, each Participant and Beneficiary shall be entitled to direct the Trustee as to the manner in which the Company Stock that is entitled to vote and that is allocated to the Company Stock Account of such Participant or Beneficiary is to be voted. If the Primary Sponsor does not have a registration-type class of securities, each Participant or Beneficiary shall be entitled to direct the Trustee as to the manner in which to vote shares of Company Stock which are allocated to the Company Stock Account of such Participant or Beneficiary with respect to any corporate manner which involves the voting of such shares with respect to the approval or disapproval of any corporate merger or consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, liquidation, dissolution, sale of substantially all assets of a trade or business, or such similar transaction as prescribed in Treasury Regulations. For purposes of this Section, the term registration-type class of securities means (1) a class of securities required to be registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and (2) a class of 
 615260243.3 

securities which would be required to be so registered except for the exemption from registration provided in subsection (g)(2)(H) of such Section 12. 
 
 15.2 Participant Voting Instructions and Unallocated Shares . Shares of Company Stock held in Accounts for which the Trustee has received instructions from Participants or Beneficiaries shall be voted in accordance with those instructions unless the fiduciary requirements of ERISA require otherwise. In the absence of voting instructions by a Participant or Beneficiary with respect to any allocated Company Stock for which the Participants or Beneficiaries have voting rights in accordance with the foregoing, such shares of Company Stock shall be voted by the Trustee in its discretion, and all Company Stock which is not then allocated to Company Stock Accounts shall be voted by the Trustee in its discretion. 
 
 15.3 Other Decisions . All decisions affecting Company Stock held under the ESOP Plan which do not involve voting of such Company Stock, including, without limitation, decisions to reject or consent to tender or exchange offers and similar decisions, shall be determined by the Trustee in its discretion. 
 
 13. Effective January 1, 2025, by adding the following new paragraph to the end of Section 3 to Appendix C as follows 
 
 Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, unless otherwise provided by uniform procedures established by the Plan Administrator from time to time in the case of a distribution of Excess Deferral Amounts, the Highly Compensated Eligible Participant s Roth Elective Deferrals will be distributed first and non-Roth Deferral Amounts second, but only to the extent such types of deferrals were made by such Highly Compensated Eligible Participant for the Plan Year. 

Except as specifically amended hereby, the Plan shall remain in full force and effect prior to this Third Amendment. 
 
 The remainder of the page is intentionally left blank
