 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that relate to future events, our future operations or financial performance, or our plans, strategies and prospects. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management team. Although we believe that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure that we will achieve or realize these plans, intentions or expectations. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events or performance, are forward-looking statements. The actual results may differ from its expectations, estimates, and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as expect, estimate, project, budget, forecast, anticipate, intend, plan, may, will, could, should, believes, predicts, potential, continue, and similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, our expectations with respect to future performance and development and commercialization of products and services. The forward-looking statements are based on projections prepared by, and are the responsibility of, management and involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are outside our control and are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements about: 
 the impact of international conflicts, pandemics or epidemics on our business; 
 the inability to maintain the listing of our Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 
 changes in applicable laws or regulations 
 our ability to raise financing in the future; 
 the success, cost and timing of our product development and commercialization activities 
 the commercialization and adoption of our existing products, including the Platinum protein sequencing instrument, and the success of any product we may offer in the future 
 our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products, and any related restrictions and limitations of any approved product 
 our ability to identify, in-license or acquire additional technology 
 our ability to maintain our existing lease, license, manufacture and supply agreements 
 our ability to compete with other companies currently marketing or engaged in the development or commercialization of products and services that serve customers engaged in proteomic analysis, many of which have greater financial and marketing resources than us 
 the size and growth potential of the markets for our products and services, and our ability to serve those markets once commercialized, either alone or in partnership with others 
 our estimates regarding future expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and needs for additional financing and 
 our financial performance. 
 These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this report, and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. Important factors could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those indicated or implied by forward-looking statements such as those described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in other filings that we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The risks described under the heading Risk Factors are not exhaustive. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. You should not put undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

 Note 1. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company has historically financed its operations primarily with proceeds from the issuance of equity to private investors, as well as with the proceeds received from the closing of the Business Combination on June 10, 2021. The Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations in all periods since inception and had an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024. The Company has incurred significant operating losses, including net losses of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of million. Management believes that the Company s current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with revenue from the sales of its products and services, will be sufficient to fund its planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Until such time as the Company can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, it expects to finance its operations through private and public equity offerings, debt financings, and/or potential future collaboration, license and development agreements. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete any such transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise, and the Company may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital when needed. The inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on the Company s financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategy. The Company will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability and it may never do so.

 Global Developments 
 Throughout 2023 , various central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve in the United States, raised interest rates. While these rate increases have not had a significant adverse impact on the Company to date, the impact of such rate increases on the overall financial markets and the economy may adversely impact the Company in the future. In addition, the global economy has experienced, and is continuing to experience, high levels of inflation and global supply chain disruptions. The Company continues to monitor these supply chain, inflation and interest rate factors, as well as the uncertainty resulting from the overall economic environment. 
 Although the Company does not expect to be significantly impacted by the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine or Israel and Gaza, the Company has experienced some constraints in product and material availability and increasing costs required to obtain some materials and supplies as a result of these conflicts on the global economy. To date, the Company s business has not been materially impacted by the conflicts, however, as the conflicts continue or worsen, it may adversely impact the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.

 -year lease for approximately square feet of space in New Haven, Connecticut. The lease commenced on January 8, 2022 with rent payments beginning on July 7, 2022. Under the lease, the landlord contractually agreed to reimburse the Company for up to million in improvements to the space, to be used for such improvements as the Company deems necessary or desirable . On September 13, 2022, the Company filed a lawsuit against the landlord, alleging that the landlord has: (i) refused to reimburse the Company for costs related to improvements already incurred and submitted, (ii) delayed the Company s completion of improvements, in order to avoid reimbursing the costs of those improvements, and (iii) improperly rejected the Company s proposed improvement plans. The Company accounted for these lease incentives as an offset to the lease liability recorded at the inception of the lease. In September 2024, the Company determined there was a change in the estimated timing of receipt of reimbursements for the improvements. This resulted in an increase of the carrying value of the right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liabilities of million. Although the Company believes it is contractually entitled to the million of lease incentives, based on the current status of the litigation, the Company cannot determine the likely outcome or estimate the impact on such carrying values.

On August 23, 2024 , the Company amended the 2023 Inducement Plan to reserve an additional shares of its Class A common stock under the 2023 Inducement Plan. As of September 30, 2024 , there were shares available for future issuance under the 2023 Inducement Plan, as amended.

 Modification of Performance Stock Options 
 In November 2022 and May 2023, the Company granted and performance-based stock option awards to its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. The vesting of these awards are subject to continued service to the Company and certain market conditions. The market conditions require the Company s Class A common stock trade above specified levels for certain periods of time. The fair values of the awards were estimated at the grant date using the Monte Carlo simulation model. 
 On March 15, 2024, the market conditions that trigger the vesting of these performance-based stock option awards were modified. The modified market conditions require the Company s Class A common stock to trade above specified levels for certain defined periods of time that are different from the original awards. The Company accounted for the modifications as modifications of market conditions. The total incremental stock-based compensation expense to be recognized for these awards is approximately million within Selling, general and administrative operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Incremental stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million and million, respectively.

 At any time while the warrants are exercisable, the Company may redeem not less than all of the outstanding Public Warrants: 
 in whole and not in part; 
 at a price of per warrant; 
 upon not less than days prior written notice of redemption (the -day redemption period to each warrant holder; and 
 if, and only if, the closing price of the Company s Class A common stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading days within a -trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 
 If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and the Company issues a notice of redemption of the Public Warrants at per warrant, each holder of Public Warrants will be entitled to exercise their Public Warrants held prior to the scheduled redemption date.

 as described above, the Board may elect to require any holder that wishes to exercise his, her or its Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis. If the Board makes such election, all holders of Public Warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the fair market value over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value . For purposes of the redemption provisions of the warrants, the fair market value means the average last reported sale price of the Class A common stock for the trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. 
 The Public Warrants do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders equity as the exercise of the Public Warrants may be settled in cash upon the occurrence of a tender offer or exchange offer in which the maker of the tender offer or exchange offer, upon completion of the tender offer or exchange offer, beneficially owns more than 50 of the outstanding shares of the Company s Class A common stock, even if it would not result in a change of control of the Company. This provision precludes the Public Warrants from being classified in equity and thus they are classified as long-term liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Private Warrants 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were Private Warrants outstanding. The Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that so long as they are held by HighCape Capital Acquisition LLC or any of its permitted transferees, (i) the Private Warrants and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Warrants were not transferable, assignable or saleable until days after the completion of the Business Combination, (ii) the Private Warrants will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder s option, and (iii) the Private Warrants are not subject to the Company s redemption option at the price of per warrant. The Private Warrants are subject to the Company s redemption option at the price of per warrant, provided that the other conditions of such redemption are met, as described above. If the Private Warrants are held by a holder other than HighCape Capital Acquisition LLC or any of its permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company in all redemption scenarios applicable to the Public Warrants and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 
 The Private Warrants do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders equity as the terms of the warrants provide for potential changes to the settlement amounts depending upon the characteristics of the warrant holder, and, because the holder of a warrant is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares. This provision precludes the Private Warrants from being classified in equity and thus they are classified as long-term liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The fair value of warrant liabilities was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company recognized a gain of million and a loss of million as a Change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recognized a gain of million and a loss of million as a Change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 21.0 and the Company s overall effective tax rate for these periods were related to stock-based compensation, the valuation allowance recorded against the full amount of the Company s net deferred tax assets and foreign taxes. 
 A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the Company s deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient future taxable income during the period in which the Company s related temporary differences become deductible. Management believes that based on the earnings history of the Company, it is more likely than not that the benefits of these assets will not be realized, and therefore, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the Company s net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

 On May 16, 2024, a punitive class action lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, styled Farzad v. HighCape Capital, et al. (the Delaware Stockholder Litigation ). The Delaware Stockholder Litigation asserts breach of fiduciary duty claims against the former officers and directors of HighCape, including Kevin Rakin, Matt Zuga, David Colpman, Robert Taub and Antony Loebel, HighCape Capital Acquisition LLC and HighCape Capital L.P., aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty claims against Foresite Capital Management, LLC and Dr. Rothberg, and unjust enrichment claims against all defendants related to the Business Combination. The Delaware Stockholder Litigation complaint alleges that the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination were a product of an unfair process which was allegedly impacted by conflicts of interest, resulting in mispricing of the Business Combination. The complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified damages and attorneys fees and costs. On July 29, 2024, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Delaware Stockholder Litigation complaint. There is no assurance that defendants will be successful in the defense of the litigation or that insurance will be available or adequate to fund any potential settlement or judgment or the litigation costs of the action. At the time of this filing the outcome of this matter is not estimable or probable. 
 In April 2023, the Company informed the contract manufacturer that had manufactured its Platinum and Carbon instruments that it intended to wind down the relationship and transition to a different contract manufacturer. In October 2023, the former contract manufacturer filed a complaint against the Company in the State of Texas alleging breach of contract and made claims for economic damage and attorney costs. In January 2024, the suit was withdrawn and refiled in the State of Minnesota alleging similar claims. Although it is not possible to determine the potential financial exposure associated with the alleged claim at this time given its early stage, the Company believes it has a meritorious defense and intends to vigorously defend against all claims asserted in the complaint. At the time of this filing the outcome of this matter is not estimable or probable.

 Overview 
 We are an innovative life sciences company with the mission of transforming single-molecule analysis and democratizing its use by providing researchers and clinicians access to the proteome, the set of proteins expressed within a cell. We have developed a proprietary universal single-molecule detection platform that we are first applying to proteomics to enable Next-Generation Protein Sequencing NGPS ), the ability to sequence proteins in a massively parallel fashion (rather than sequentially, one at a time), that can be used for the study of nucleic acids. Our platform was designed to offer an end-to-end workflow including both sample preparation and sequencing and is comprised of our Platinum NGPS instrument, the Platinum Analysis Software service, and reagent kits and proprietary semiconductor chips for use with our Platinum instrument. We began a controlled launch of the Platinum instrument in December 2022 and subsequently initiated a full commercial launch at the end of the first quarter of 2024. 
 Now that our Platinum and Platinum Analysis Software system has launched, we intend to follow a systematic, phased approach to continue to successfully launch updates to our platform. We believe we are the first company to successfully enable NGPS on a semiconductor chip, thus digitizing a massive proteomics opportunity, which allows for a massively parallel solution at the ultimate level of sensitivity - single-molecule detection. We believe our platform, which is designed to streamline sequencing and data analysis at a lower instrument cost than legacy proteomic solutions, could allow our product to have wide utility across the study of the proteome. For example, we believe our platform could be used for biomarker discovery and disease detection, pathway analysis, immune response, vaccine development, quality assurance and quality control, among other applications.

 Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the issuance of equity to private investors, as well as with the proceeds received from the closing of the Business Combination on June 10, 2021. Additionally, we began to generate revenue during 2023 from commercial sales of our Platinum instrument. Our primary uses of liquidity have been operating expenses, capital expenditures and our acquisition of certain assets. Cash flows from operations have been historically negative as we continue to invest in the development of our technology in NGPS. Going forward, we anticipate debt or equity offerings will be the primary source of funds to support our operating needs and capital expenditures until we reach scale of our commercial operations. We expect to incur negative operating cash flows on an annual basis for the foreseeable future until such time that we can scale our revenue growth. 
 We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities, together with revenue from the sale of our products and services, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity, capital expenditure, and anticipated working capital requirements and fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect to use our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities and funds from revenue generated to invest in our continued commercialization efforts, to further invest in research and development, for other operating expenses, business acquisitions and for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities tot aling 196.3 million. Our future capital requirements may vary from those currently planned and will depend on various factors including the pace and success of product commercialization. 
 Our ongoing commercialization of Platinum as well as our continuing research and development efforts to enhance our Platinum instrument may require an accelerated amount of spending to enhance the sales and marketing teams, continue to drive development, and build inventory. Other factors that could accelerate cash needs include: (i) delays in achieving scientific and technical milestones, (ii) unforeseen capital expenditures and fabrication costs related to manufacturing for commercialization, (iii) changes we may make in our business or commercialization strategy, (iv) costs of running a public company, (v) other items affecting our forecasted level of expenditures and use of cash resources, including potential acquisitions, and (vi) increased product and service costs. 
 In August 2023, we filed a 150 million Shelf Registration Statement (the Shelf Registration Statement ), which became effective on August 22, 2023. 
 In August 2023, we also entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement EDA with an outside placement agent (the Agent ), under which we may, from time to time, sell shares of our Class A common stock under the ATM Offering (as defined below). The Shelf Registration Statement includes a prospectus supplement covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to 75 million of our Class A common stock, from time to time, in at-the-market offerings through the Agent (the ATM Offering ). The shares to be sold under the EDA may be issued and sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. The EDA also provides that the Agent will be entitled to compensation for its services in an amount up to 3.0 of the gross proceeds from the sales of shares sold through the Agent under the EDA. We have no obligation to sell any shares under the EDA and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the EDA. To date, we have not issued or sold any shares of our Class A common stock under the ATM Offering. 
 In the future, we may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on acceptable terms or otherwise, we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance products and services, respond to competitive pressure or take advantage of acquisition opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We forecast capital expenditures in order to execute on our business plan and maintain growth; however, the actual amount and timing of such capital expenditures will ultimately be determined by the volume of business. We anticipate our future capital expenditures will be at approximately the same level as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 . We have funded and plan to continue funding these capital expenditures with cash and financing.

 Contractual Obligations 
 We lease certain facilities and equipment under non-cancellable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2032. As of September 30, 2024 , future lease payments, before adjustments for tenant incentives, were approximately 27.8 million . 
 Licenses related to certain intellectual property 
 We license certain intellectual property, some of which may be utilized in our current or future product offerings. To preserve the right to use such intellectual property, we are required to make annual minimum fixed payments totaling approximately 0.1 million as we ll as royalties based on net sales if the royalties exceed annual minimum fixed payments. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about items that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Please refer to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the accompanying notes to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete description of our significant accounting policies. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 Please refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the accompanying notes to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Inflation risk 
 We believe inflation can and has had an impact on the underlying cost of our supplies and manufacturing components related to our business. To the extent our costs are impacted by general inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases or manufacturing efficiencies. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Interest rate risk 
 As of September 30, 2024 , our marketable securities are comprised primarily of investments in money market funds backed by U.S. government issued securities, U.S. Treasury bills, and high-quality corporate commercial paper. The primary objective of our investments is the preservation of capital to fulfill liquidity needs. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Based on the short-term nature of our holdings, future interest rate changes are not expected to have a material impact on our marketable securities. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Presently, we operate our business primarily within the United States, with limited sales outside the United States. To date, we have executed the majority of our transactions in U.S. dollars. In the future, we anticipate expanding into Europe and other locations outside the United States. This expansion may include transacting business in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Despite this, we anticipate conducting limited activity outside the U.S. Dollar in the near term, and therefore foreign currency translation risk is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the growth of our operations, scope of transactions outside the United States, and the use of currencies other than 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 the U.S. Dollar may grow in the future, at which point it is possible foreign currency translation will have a material effect on our operations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to managing our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 . 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 From time to time, the Company is engaged in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For further information on the Company s legal proceedings, please refer to Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies , in the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors described under the caption Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on May 9, 2024, and the risk factor described below. We may disclose changes to risk factors or additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 
 
 We could fail to maintain the listing of our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq ), which could seriously harm the liquidity of our shares and our ability to raise capital or complete a strategic transaction. 
 Nasdaq has established continued listing requirements, including a requirement to maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least 1.00 per share. On November 4, 2024, we received written notice from Nasdaq notifying us that, because the closing bid price for our Class A common stock has fallen below 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, we no longer meet the minimum bid price requirement for continued inclusion on The Nasdaq Global Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) (the Bid Price Requirement ). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have been provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until May 5, 2025 (the Compliance Date ), to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our Class A common stock must be at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during this 180-calendar day period. If we do not regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement by the Compliance Date, we may be eligible for an additional 180-calendar day compliance period. To qualify, we would need to transfer the listing of our Class A common stock to The Nasdaq Capital Market and meet the continued listing requirement for the market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards, with the exception of the Bid Price Requirement. To effect such a transfer, we would also need to pay an application fee to Nasdaq and would need to provide written notice to the Staff of our intention to cure the deficiency during the additional compliance period. 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement or maintain compliance with other Nasdaq requirements in the future. If we are not able to maintain compliance with Nasdaq requirements, our Class A common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders, including by reducing the liquidity of our shares and having a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital or complete a strategic transaction.

The Administrator of the Plan will be the Board of Directors, except to the extent the Board of Directors delegates its authority to the Committee, in which case the Committee shall be the Administrator. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator is authorized to

 (c) Determine the number of Shares for which a Stock Right or Stock Rights shall be granted and specify the terms and conditions upon which Stock Rights may be granted 
 (d) Specify the terms and conditions upon which a Stock Right or Stock Rights may be granted provided that no dividends or dividend equivalents shall be paid on any Stock Right prior to the vesting of the underlying Shares 
 (e) Amend any term or condition of any outstanding Stock Right, provided that (i) such term or condition as amended is not prohibited by the Plan and (ii) any such amendment shall not impair the rights of a Participant under any Stock Right previously granted without such Participant s consent or in the event of death of the Participant the Participant s Survivors 
 (f) Determine and make any adjustments in the Performance Goals included in any Performance-Based Awards and

 The Administrator will, in its sole discretion, name the Participants in the Plan provided, however, that each Participant must be an Employee of the Company or of an Affiliate at the 
 5 

time a Stock Right is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may authorize the grant of a Stock Right to a person in anticipation of such person becoming an Employee of the Company or of an Affiliate, provided, that the actual grant of such Stock Right shall be conditioned upon such person becoming eligible to become a Participant at or prior to the time of the execution of the Agreement evidencing such Stock Right. Non-Qualified Options, Stock Grants and Stock-Based Awards may be granted to any Employee of the Company or an Affiliate. The granting of any Stock Right to any individual shall neither entitle that individual to, nor disqualify that individual from, participation in any other grant of Stock Rights or any grant under any other benefit plan established by the Company or any Affiliate for Employees. 
 6. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS . 
 Each Option shall be set forth in an Option Agreement duly executed by the Company and, to the extent required by law or requested by the Company, by the Participant.

 (iv) Term of Option Each Option shall terminate not more than ten years from the date of the grant or at such earlier time as the Option Agreement may provide.

 6 

exercise price of such Options, (ii) cancel outstanding Options in exchange for Options that have an exercise price that is less than the exercise price value of the original Options, or (iii) cancel outstanding Options that have an exercise price greater than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of such cancellation in exchange for cash or other consideration. 
 7. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK GRANTS . 
 Each Stock Grant to a Participant shall state the principal terms in an Agreement duly executed by the Company and, to the extent required by law or requested by the Company, by the Participant.

 8. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS . 
 The Administrator shall have the right to grant other Stock-Based Awards based upon the Class A Common Stock having such terms and conditions as the Administrator may determine, including, without limitation, the grant of Shares based upon certain conditions, the grant of securities convertible into Shares and the grant of SARs, phantom stock awards or stock units.

No Performance-Based Awards will be issued for such performance period until such certification is made by the Committee. The number of Shares issued in respect of a Performance-Based Award determined by the Committee for a performance period shall be paid to the Participant at such time as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion after the end of such performance period, and any dividends (other than stock dividends to be issued pursuant to Paragraph 24 of the Plan) or dividend equivalents that accrue shall only be paid in respect of the number of Shares earned in respect of such Performance-Based Award. 
 10. EXERCISE OF OPTIONS AND ISSUE OF SHARES . 
 An Option (or any part or installment thereof) shall be exercised by giving written notice to the Company or its designee (in a form acceptable to the Administrator, which may include electronic notice), together with provision for payment of the aggregate exercise price in accordance with this Paragraph for the Shares as to which the Option is being exercised, and upon compliance with any other condition(s) set forth in the Option Agreement. Such notice shall be signed by the person exercising the Option (which signature may be provided electronically in a form acceptable to the Administrator), shall state the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised and shall contain any representation required by the Plan or the Option Agreement. Payment of the exercise price for the Shares as to which such Option is being exercised shall be made (a) in United States dollars in cash or by check or (b) at the discretion of the Administrator, through delivery of shares of Class A Common Stock held for at least six months (if required to avoid negative accounting treatment) having a Fair Market Value equal as of the date of the exercise to the aggregate cash exercise price for the number of Shares as to which the Option is being exercised or (c) at the discretion of the Administrator, by having the Company retain from the Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of the Option, a number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal as of the date of exercise to the aggregate exercise price for the number of Shares as to which the Option is being exercised or (d) at the discretion of the Administrator, in accordance with a cashless exercise program established with a securities brokerage firm, and approved by the Administrator or (e) at the discretion of the Administrator, by any combination of (a), (b), (c) and (d) above or (f) at the discretion of the Administrator, by payment of such other lawful consideration as the Administrator may determine. 
 The Company shall then reasonably promptly deliver the Shares as to which such Option was exercised to the Participant (or to the Participant s Survivors, as the case may be). In 
 8 

determining what constitutes reasonably promptly, it is expressly understood that the issuance and delivery of the Shares may be delayed by the Company if the Administrator determines it is necessary to comply with any law or regulation (including, without limitation, federal securities laws) that requires the Company to take any action with respect to the Shares prior to their issuance. The Shares shall, upon delivery, be fully paid, non-assessable Shares. 
 11. PAYMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK GRANTS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS AND ISSUE OF SHARES . 
 Any Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award requiring payment of a purchase price for the Shares as to which such Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award is being granted shall be made (a) in United States dollars in cash or by check or (b) at the discretion of the Administrator, through delivery of shares of Class A Common Stock held for at least six months (if required to avoid negative accounting treatment) and having a Fair Market Value equal as of the date of payment to the purchase price of the Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award or (c) by delivery of a promissory note, if the Board of Directors has expressly authorized the loan of funds to the Participant for the purpose of enabling or assisting the Participant to effect such purchase (d) at the discretion of the Administrator, by any combination of (a) through (c) above or (e) at the discretion of the Administrator, by payment of such other lawful consideration as the Administrator may determine. 
 The Company shall when required by the applicable Agreement, reasonably promptly deliver the Shares as to which such Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award was made to the Participant (or to the Participant s Survivors, as the case may be), subject to any escrow provision set forth in the applicable Agreement. In determining what constitutes reasonably promptly, it is expressly understood that the issuance and delivery of the Shares may be delayed by the Company if the Administrator determines it is necessary to comply with any law or regulation (including, without limitation, federal securities laws) which requires the Company to take any action with respect to the Shares prior to their issuance.

 13. ASSIGNABILITY AND TRANSFERABILITY OF STOCK RIGHTS . 
 By its terms, a Stock Right granted to a Participant shall not be transferable by the Participant other than (i) by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, or (ii) as approved by the Administrator in its discretion and set forth in the applicable Agreement provided that no Stock Right may be transferred by a Participant for value. The designation of a beneficiary of a Stock Right by a Participant, with the prior approval of the Administrator and in such form as the Administrator shall prescribe, shall not be deemed a transfer prohibited by this Paragraph. 
 9 

Except as provided above during the Participant s lifetime a Stock Right shall only be exercisable by or issued to such Participant (or his or her legal representative) and shall not be assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempted transfer, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of any Stock Right or of any rights granted thereunder contrary to the provisions of this Plan, or the levy of any attachment or similar process upon a Stock Right, shall be null and void. 
 14. EFFECT ON OPTIONS OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE OR DEATH OR DISABILITY . 
 Except as otherwise provided in a Participant s Option Agreement in the event of a termination of service with the Company or an Affiliate before the Participant has exercised an Option, the following rules apply 
 (a) A Participant who ceases to provide services to the Company or an Affiliate (for any reason other than termination for Cause, Disability, or death for which events there are special rules in Paragraphs 15, 16, and 17, respectively), may exercise any Option granted to such Participant to the extent that the Option is exercisable on the date of such termination of service, but only within such term as the Administrator has designated in a Participant s Option Agreement. 
 (b) The provisions of this Paragraph, and not the provisions of Paragraph 16 or 17, shall apply to a Participant who subsequently becomes Disabled or dies after the termination of service provided, however, in the case of a Participant s Disability or death within three months after the termination of service, the Participant or the Participant s Survivors may exercise the Option within one year after the date of the Participant s termination of service, but in no event after the date of expiration of the term of the Option. 
 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if subsequent to a Participant s service, but prior to the exercise of an Option, the Administrator determines that, either prior or subsequent to the Participant s termination, the Participant engaged in conduct which would constitute Cause, then such Participant shall forthwith cease to have any right to exercise any Option. 
 (d) A Participant to whom an Option has been granted under the Plan who is absent from the Company or an Affiliate because of temporary disability (any disability other than a Disability as defined in Paragraph 1 hereof), or who is on leave of absence for any purpose, shall not, during the period of any such absence, be deemed, by virtue of such absence alone, to have terminated such Participant s service with the Company or with an Affiliate, except as the Administrator may otherwise expressly provide. 
 (e) Except as required by law or as set forth in a Participant s Option Agreement, Options granted under the Plan shall not be affected by any change of a Participant s status within or among the Company and any Affiliates, so long as the Participant continues to be an Employee of the Company or any Affiliate. 
 10 

(f) Except as otherwise set forth in a Participant s Option Agreement, if a Participant ceases to be an Employee of the Company or any Affiliate but upon cessation of such services immediately becomes an Employee of a 4Catalyzer Corporation, Options granted under the Plan shall cease vesting in accordance with the Participant s Option Agreement but shall remain exercisable until the earliest of (i) three months from the date when the Participant is no longer providing services as an Employee to any 4Catalyzer Corporation for any reason other than for Cause, death, or Disability (ii) three months from the date when the company to which the Participant is providing services as an Employee is no longer a 4Catalyzer Corporation (ii) one year from the date of the Participant s death or Disability (iii) immediately upon notification by a 4Catalyzer Corporation that the Participant is being terminated by a 4Catalyzer Corporation for Cause (iv) the expiration date of the Option as set forth in the Participant s Option Agreement or (v) the termination of the Option in accordance with Paragraph 23 or 24 of the Plan. 
 15. EFFECT ON OPTIONS OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE FOR CAUSE . 
 Except as otherwise provided in a Participant s Option Agreement, the following rules apply if the Participant s service with the Company or an Affiliate is terminated for Cause prior to the time that all his or her outstanding Options have been exercised 
 (a) All outstanding and unexercised Options as of the time the Participant is notified his or her service is terminated for Cause will immediately be forfeited. 
 (b) Cause is not limited to events which have occurred prior to a Participant s termination of service, nor is it necessary that the Administrator s finding of Cause occur prior to termination. If the Administrator determines, subsequent to a Participant s termination of service but prior to the exercise of an Option, that either prior or subsequent to the Participant s termination the Participant engaged in conduct which would constitute Cause, then the right to exercise any Option is forfeited.

 Except as otherwise provided in a Participant s Option Agreement 
 (a) A Participant who ceases to be an Employee of the Company or of an Affiliate by reason of Disability may exercise any Option granted to such Participant to the extent that the Option has become exercisable but has not been exercised on the date of the Participant s termination of service due to Disability and in the event rights to exercise the Option accrue periodically, to the extent of a pro rata portion through the date of the Participant s termination of service due to Disability of any additional vesting rights that would have accrued on the next vesting date had the Participant not become Disabled. The proration shall be based upon the number of days accrued in the current vesting period prior to the date of the Participant s termination of service due to Disability. 
 (b) A Disabled Participant may exercise the Option only within the period ending one year after the date of the Participant s termination of service due to Disability, notwithstanding that the Participant might have been able to exercise the Option as to some or all of the Shares on 
 11 

a later date if the Participant had not been terminated due to Disability and had continued to be an Employee or, if earlier, within the originally prescribed term of the Option. 
 (c) The Administrator shall make the determination both of whether Disability has occurred and the date of its occurrence (unless a procedure for such determination is set forth in another agreement between the Company and such Participant, in which case such procedure shall be used for such determination). If requested, the Participant shall be examined by a physician selected or approved by the Administrator, the cost of which examination shall be paid for by the Company. 
 17. EFFECT ON OPTIONS OF DEATH WHILE AN EMPLOYEE . 
 Except as otherwise provided in a Participant s Option Agreement

The proration shall be based upon the number of days accrued in the current vesting period prior to the Participant s date of death. 
 (b) If the Participant s Survivors wish to exercise the Option, they must take all necessary steps to exercise the Option within one year after the date of death of such Participant, notwithstanding that the decedent might have been able to exercise the Option as to some or all of the Shares on a later date if he or she had not died and had continued to be an Employee or, if earlier, within the originally prescribed term of the Option. 
 18. EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE ON UNACCEPTED STOCK GRANTS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS. 
 In the event of a termination of service (as an Employee) with the Company or an Affiliate for any reason before the Participant has accepted a Stock Grant or a Stock-Based Award and paid the purchase price, if required, such grant shall terminate. 
 For purposes of this Paragraph 18 and Paragraph 19 below, a Participant to whom a Stock Grant or a Stock-Based Award has been issued under the Plan who is absent from work with the Company or with an Affiliate because of temporary disability (any disability other than a Disability as defined in Paragraph 1 hereof), or who is on leave of absence for any purpose, shall not, during the period of any such absence, be deemed, by virtue of such absence alone, to have terminated such Participant s employment with the Company or with an Affiliate, except as the Administrator may otherwise expressly provide. 
 In addition, for purposes of this Paragraph 18 and Paragraph 19 below, any change of employment or other service within or among the Company and any Affiliates shall not be 
 12 

treated as a termination of employment so long as the Participant continues to be an Employee of the Company or any Affiliate. 
 19. EFFECT ON STOCK GRANTS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, DEATH OR DISABILITY .

Upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, any outstanding Stock-Based Awards shall immediately terminate unless otherwise determined by the Administrator or specifically provided in the applicable Agreement. 
 24. ADJUSTMENTS .

 (a) Changes with respect to Shares of Common Stock. 
 14 

(b) If (1) the shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or combined into a greater or smaller number of shares or if the Company shall issue any shares of Common Stock as a stock dividend on its outstanding Common Stock, or (2) additional shares or new or different shares or other securities of the Company or other non-cash assets are distributed with respect to such shares of Common Stock, each Stock Right and the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable thereunder shall be appropriately increased or decreased proportionately, and appropriate adjustments shall be made including, in the exercise, base or purchase price per share and in the Performance Goals applicable to outstanding Performance-Based Awards to reflect such events. The number of Shares subject to the limitations in Paragraphs 3(a), 3(b), 3(d) and 4(c) shall also be proportionately adjusted upon the occurrence of such events. 
 (c) The Administrator may also make adjustments of the type described in Paragraph 24(a) above to take into account distributions to stockholders other than those provided for in Paragraphs 24(b) below, or any other event, if the Administrator determines that adjustments are appropriate to avoid distortion in the operation of the Plan or any Award, having due regard for the requirements of Section 409A, to the extent applicable. 
 (d) References in the Plan to Shares will be construed to include any stock or securities resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Paragraph 24(a). 
 (e) Corporate Transactions . If the Company is to be consolidated with or acquired by another entity in a Corporate Transaction, the Administrator or the board of directors of any entity assuming the obligations of the Company hereunder (the Successor Board ), may, as to outstanding Options, take any of the following actions (i) make appropriate provision for the continuation of such Options by substituting on an equitable basis for the Shares then subject to such Options either the consideration payable with respect to the outstanding shares of Common Stock in connection with the Corporate Transaction or securities of any successor or acquiring entity or (ii) upon written notice to the Participants, provide that such Options must be exercised (either (A) to the extent then exercisable or (B) at the discretion of the Administrator, any such Options being made partially or fully exercisable for purposes of this Subparagraph), within a specified number of days of the date of such notice, at the end of which period such Options which have not been exercised shall terminate or (iii) terminate such Options in exchange for payment of an amount equal to the consideration payable upon consummation of such Corporate Transaction to a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Option would have been exercisable (either (A) to the extent then exercisable or, (B) at the discretion of the Administrator, any such Options being made partially or fully exercisable for purposes of this Subparagraph) less the aggregate exercise price thereof. For purposes of determining the payments to be made pursuant to Subclause (iii) above, in the case of a Corporate Transaction the consideration for which, in whole or in part, is other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be valued at the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. For the avoidance of doubt, if the per share exercise price of an Option or portion thereof is equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value of one Share of Common Stock, such Option may be cancelled with no payment due hereunder or otherwise in respect thereof. 
 15 

With respect to outstanding Stock Grants or Stock-Based Awards, the Administrator or the Successor Board, shall make appropriate provision for the continuation of such Stock Grants or Stock-Based Awards on the same terms and conditions by substituting on an equitable basis for the Shares then subject to such Stock Grants or Stock-Based Awards either the consideration payable with respect to the outstanding Shares of Common Stock in connection with the Corporate Transaction or securities of any successor or acquiring entity. In lieu of the foregoing, in connection with any Corporate Transaction, the Administrator may provide that each outstanding Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award shall be terminated in exchange for payment of an amount equal to the consideration payable upon consummation of such Corporate Transaction to a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock comprising such Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award (to the extent such Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award is no longer subject to any forfeiture or repurchase rights then in effect or, at the discretion of the Administrator, all forfeiture and repurchase rights being waived). For the avoidance of doubt, if the purchase or base price of a Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award or portion thereof is equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value of one Share of Common Stock, such Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award, as applicable, may be cancelled with no payment due hereunder or otherwise in respect thereof. 
 In taking any of the actions permitted under this Paragraph 24(b), the Administrator shall not be obligated by the Plan to treat all Stock Rights, all Stock Rights held by a Participant, or all Stock Rights of the same type, identically. 
 (f) Recapitalization or Reorganization . In the event of a recapitalization or reorganization of the Company other than a Corporate Transaction pursuant to which securities of the Company or of another corporation are issued with respect to the outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Participant upon exercising an Option or accepting a Stock Grant after the recapitalization or reorganization shall be entitled to receive for the price paid upon such exercise or acceptance if any, the number of replacement securities which would have been received if such Option had been exercised or Stock Grant accepted prior to such recapitalization or reorganization. 
 (g) Adjustments to Stock-Based Awards . Upon the happening of any of the events described in Subparagraphs (a), (b) or (c) above, any outstanding Stock-Based Award shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the events described in such Subparagraphs. The Administrator or the Successor Board shall determine the specific adjustments to be made under this Paragraph 24, including, but not limited to the effect of any, Corporate Transaction and, subject to Paragraph 4, its determination shall be conclusive. 
 (h) Termination of Awards upon Consummation of a Corporate Transaction . Except as the Administrator may otherwise determine, each Stock Right will automatically terminate (and in the case of outstanding Shares of restricted Common Stock, will automatically be forfeited) immediately upon the consummation of a Corporate Transaction, other than (i) any award that is assumed, continued or substituted pursuant to Paragraph 24(b) above, and (ii) any cash award that by its terms, or as a result of action taken by the Administrator, continues following the consummation of the Corporate Transaction. 
 25. ISSUANCES OF SECURITIES . 
 16 

(a) Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares subject to Stock Rights. Except as expressly provided herein, no adjustments shall be made for dividends paid in cash or in property (including without limitation, securities) of the Company prior to any issuance of Shares pursuant to a Stock Right. 
 (b) The Company will not be obligated to issue any Shares pursuant to the Plan or to remove any restriction from Shares previously issued under the Plan until (i) the Company is satisfied that all legal matters in connection with the issuance of such Shares have been addressed and resolved (ii) if the outstanding Shares is at the time of issuance listed on any stock exchange or national market system, the Shares to be issued have been listed or authorized to be listed on such exchange or system upon official notice of issuance and (iii) all conditions of the award have been satisfied or waived. The Company may require, as a condition to the exercise of an award or the issuance of Shares under an award, such representations or agreements as counsel for the Company may consider appropriate to avoid violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any applicable state or non-U.S. securities law. Any Shares issued under the Plan will be evidenced in such manner as the Administrator determines appropriate, including book-entry registration or delivery of stock certificates. In the event that the Administrator determines that stock certificates will be issued in connection with Shares issued under the Plan, the Administrator may require that such certificates bear an appropriate legend reflecting any restriction on transfer applicable to such Stock, and the Company may hold the certificates pending the lapse of the applicable restrictions. 
 26. FRACTIONAL SHARES . 
 No fractional shares shall be issued under the Plan and the person exercising a Stock Right shall receive from the Company cash in lieu of such fractional shares equal to the Fair Market Value thereof. 
 27. WITHHOLDING . 
 In the event that any federal, state, or local income taxes, employment taxes, Federal Insurance Contributions Act withholdings or other amounts are required by applicable law or governmental regulation to be withheld from the Participant s salary, wages or other remuneration in connection with the issuance of a Stock Right or Shares under the Plan or for any other reason required by law, the Company may withhold from the Participant s compensation, if any, or may require that the Participant advance in cash to the Company, or to any Affiliate of the Company which employs or employed the Participant, the statutory minimum amount of such withholdings unless a different withholding arrangement, including the use of shares of the Company s Common Stock or a promissory note, is authorized by the Administrator (and permitted by law). For purposes hereof, the fair market value of the shares withheld for purposes of payroll withholding shall be determined in the manner set forth under the definition of Fair Market Value provided in Paragraph 1 above, as of the most recent practicable date. If the Fair Market Value of the shares withheld is less than the amount of 
 17 

payroll withholdings required, the Participant may be required to advance the difference in cash to the Company or the Affiliate employer. 
 28. TERMINATION OF THE PLAN . 
 The Plan will terminate on May 8, 2033, the date which is ten years from the date of its adoption by the Board of Directors. The Plan may be terminated at an earlier date by vote of the Board of Directors of the Company provided, however, that any such earlier termination shall not affect any Agreements executed prior to the effective date of such termination. Termination of the Plan shall not affect any Stock Rights theretofore granted. 
 29. AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN AND AGREEMENTS . 
 The Plan may be amended by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Plan may also be amended by the Administrator provided that any amendment approved by the Administrator which the Administrator determines is of a scope that requires shareholder approval shall be subject to obtaining such shareholder approval including, without limitation, to the extent necessary to qualify the Shares issuable under the Plan for listing on any national securities exchange or quotation in any national automated quotation system of securities dealers. Any modification or amendment of the Plan shall not, without the consent of a Participant, adversely affect his or her rights under a Stock Right previously granted to such Participant, unless such amendment is required by applicable law or necessary to preserve the economic value of such Stock Right. With the consent of the Participant affected, the Administrator may amend outstanding Agreements in a manner which may be adverse to the Participant but which is not inconsistent with the Plan. In the discretion of the Administrator, outstanding Agreements may be amended by the Administrator in a manner which is not adverse to the Participant. Nothing in this Paragraph 29 shall limit the Administrator s authority to take any action permitted pursuant to Paragraph 24. 
 30. EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP . 
 Nothing in this Plan or any Agreement shall be deemed to prevent the Company or an Affiliate from terminating the employment, status of a Participant, nor to prevent a Participant from terminating his or her own employment status or to give any Participant a right to be retained in employment or other service by the Company or any Affiliate for any period of time. 
 31. SECTION 409A . 
 The Company intends that the Plan and any Awards granted hereunder be exempt from or comply with Section 409A, to the extent applicable. Any ambiguities in the Plan or any Award shall be construed to effect the intent as described in this Paragraph 31. 
 If a Participant is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A (and as applied according to procedures of the Company and its Affiliates) as of his or her separation from service, to the extent any payment under this Plan or pursuant to an Award constitutes non-exempt deferred compensation under Section 409A that is being paid by reason of separation 
 18 

from service, no payments due under this Plan or pursuant to an Award may be made until the earlier of (i) the first day of the seventh month following the Participant s separation from service, or (ii) the Participant s date of death provided, however, that any payments delayed during this six-month period shall be paid in the aggregate in a lump sum, without interest, on the first day of the seventh month following the Participant s separation from service. 
 The Administrator shall administer the Plan with a view toward ensuring that Awards under the Plan that are subject to Section 409A comply with the requirements thereof and that Options under the Plan be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A, but neither the Administrator nor any member of the Board of Directors, nor the Company nor any of its Affiliates, nor any other person acting hereunder on behalf of the Company, the Administrator or the Board of Directors shall be liable to a Participant or any Survivor by reason of the acceleration of any income, or the imposition of any additional tax or penalty, with respect to any Award, whether by reason of a failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A or otherwise. 
 32. INDEMNITY . 
 Neither the Board of Directors nor the Administrator, nor any members of either, nor any employees of the Company or any parent, subsidiary, or other Affiliate, shall be liable for any act, omission, interpretation, construction or determination made in good faith in connection with their responsibilities with respect to this Plan, and the Company hereby agrees to indemnify the members of the Board or Directors, the members of the Committee, and the employees of the Company and its parent or subsidiaries in respect of any claim, loss, damage, or expense (including reasonable counsel fees) arising from any such act, omission, interpretation, construction or determination to the full extent permitted by law. 
 33. CLAWBACK . 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan, the Company may recover from a Participant any compensation received from any Stock Right (whether or not settled) or cause a Participant to forfeit any Stock Right (whether or not vested) in the event that the Company s Clawback Policy as then in effect is triggered. 
 34. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL . 
 By accepting or being deemed to have accepted an award under the Plan, each Participant waives (or will be deemed to have waived), to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, any right to a trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim concerning any rights under the Plan or any award, or under any amendment, waiver, consent, instrument, document or other agreement delivered or which in the future may be delivered in connection therewith, and agrees (or will be deemed to have agreed) that any such action, proceedings or counterclaim will be tried before a court and not before a jury. By accepting or being deemed to have accepted an award under the Plan, each Participant certifies that no officer, representative, or attorney of the Company has represented, expressly or otherwise, that the Company would not, in the event of any action, proceeding or counterclaim, seek to enforce the foregoing waivers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, nothing herein is to be construed as limiting the ability of the 
 19 

Company and a Participant to agree to submit any dispute arising under the terms of the Plan or any ward to binding arbitration or as limiting the ability of the Company to require any individual to agree to submit such disputes to binding arbitration as a condition of receiving an award hereunder. 
 35. UNFUNDED OBLIGATIONS . 
 The Company s obligations under the Plan are unfunded, and no Participant will have any right to specific assets of the Company in respect of any award under the Plan. Participants will be general unsecured creditors of the Company with respect to any amounts due or payable under the Plan. 
 36. GOVERNING LAW . 
 This Plan shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware

 WHEREAS, the Company and the Participant understand and agree that any terms used and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan. 
 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows 
 
 1. Grant of Award . The Company hereby grants to the Participant an award for the number of RSUs set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice (the Award ). Each RSU represents a contingent entitlement of the Participant to receive one share of Common Stock, on the terms and conditions and subject to all the limitations set forth herein and in the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Participant acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan. 
 
 2. Vesting of Award . 
 
 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan, the Award granted hereby shall vest as set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice and is subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan. On each vesting date set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice, the Participant shall be entitled to receive such number of shares of Common Stock equivalent to the number of RSUs as set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice provided that the Participant is providing service 

to the Company or an Affiliate on such vesting date. Such shares of Common Stock shall thereafter be delivered by the Company to the Participant within five business days of the applicable vesting date and in accordance with this Agreement and the Plan. 
 
 (b) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, if the Participant ceases to be providing services for any reason to the Company or an Affiliate (the Termination prior to a vesting date set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice, then as of the date on which the Participant s employment or service terminates, all unvested RSUs shall immediately be forfeited to the Company and this Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect. 
 
 3. Prohibitions on Transfer and Sale . This Award (including any additional RSUs received by the Participant as a result of stock dividends, stock splits or any other similar transaction affecting the Company s securities without receipt of consideration) shall not be transferable by the Participant otherwise than (i) by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, or (ii) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Internal Revenue Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or the rules thereunder. Except as provided in the previous sentence, the shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement shall be issued, during the Participant s lifetime, only to the Participant (or, in the event of legal incapacity or incompetence, to the Participant s guardian or representative). This Award shall not be assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempted transfer, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of this Award or of any rights granted hereunder contrary to the provisions of this Section 3, or the levy of any attachment or similar process upon this Award shall be null and void. 
 
 4. Adjustments . The Plan contains provisions covering the treatment of RSUs and shares of Common Stock in a number of contingencies such as stock splits. Provisions in the Plan for adjustment with respect to this Award and the related provisions with respect to successors to the business of the Company are hereby made applicable hereunder and are incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 5. Securities Law Compliance . The Participant specifically acknowledges and agrees that any sales of shares of Common Stock shall be made in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company currently has an effective registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the Common Stock to be granted hereunder. The Company intends to maintain this registration statement but has no obligation to do so. If the registration statement ceases to be effective for any reason, Participant will not be able to transfer or sell any of the shares of Common Stock issued to the Participant pursuant to this Agreement unless exemptions from registration or filings under applicable securities laws are available. Furthermore, despite registration, applicable securities laws may restrict the ability of the Participant to sell his or her Common Stock, including due to the Participant s affiliation with the Company. The Company shall not be obligated to either issue the Common Stock or permit the resale of any shares of Common Stock if such issuance or resale would violate any applicable securities law, rule or regulation. 

6. Rights as a Stockholder . The Participant shall have no right as a stockholder, including voting and dividend rights, with respect to the RSUs subject to this Agreement. 
 
 7. Incorporation of the Plan . The Participant specifically understands and agrees that the RSUs and the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the Plan will be issued to the Participant pursuant to the Plan, a copy of which Plan the Participant acknowledges he or she has read and understands and by which Plan he or she agrees to be bound. The provisions of the Plan are incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 8. Tax Liability of the Participant and Payment of Taxes . The Participant acknowledges and agrees that any income or other taxes due from the Participant with respect to this Award or the shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise sold shall be the Participant s responsibility. Without limiting the foregoing, the Participant agrees that if under applicable law the Participant will owe taxes at each vesting date on the portion of the Award then vested the Company shall be entitled to immediate payment from the Participant of the amount of any tax or other amounts required to be withheld by the Company by applicable law or regulation. Any taxes or other amounts due shall be paid, at the option of the Administrator as follows 
 
 (a) through reducing the number of shares of Common Stock entitled to be issued to the Participant on the applicable vesting date in an amount equal to the statutory minimum of the Participant s total tax and other withholding obligations due and payable by the Company. Fractional shares will not be retained to satisfy any portion of the Company s withholding obligation. Accordingly, the Participant agrees that in the event that the amount of withholding required would result in a fraction of a share being owed, that amount will be satisfied by withholding the fractional amount from the Participant s paycheck 
 
 (b) requiring the Participant to deposit with the Company an amount of cash equal to the amount determined by the Company to be required to be withheld with respect to the statutory minimum amount of the Participant s total tax and other withholding obligations due and payable by the Company or otherwise withholding from the Participant s paycheck an amount equal to such amounts due and payable by the Company or 
 
 (c) by requiring the sale by the Participant on the applicable vesting date of such number of shares of Common Stock as the Company instructs a registered broker to sell to satisfy the Company s withholding obligation, after deduction of the broker s commission, and the broker shall be required to remit to the Company the cash necessary in order for the Company to satisfy its withholding obligation. Such sales shall be made pursuant to a mandatory sell-to-cover program instituted by the Company with no discretion by the Participant with respect to any sale under the sell-to-cover program. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the Company s withholding obligation the Company agrees to pay such excess cash to the Participant as soon as practicable. In addition, if such sale is not sufficient to pay the Company s withholding obligation the Participant agrees to pay to the Company as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, the amount of any withholding obligation that is not satisfied 

by the sale of shares of Common Stock. The Participant agrees to hold the Company and the broker harmless from all costs, damages or expenses relating to any such sale. The Participant acknowledges that the Company and the broker are under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price. In connection with such sale of shares of Common Stock, the Participant shall execute any such documents requested by the broker in order to effectuate the sale of shares of Common Stock and payment of the withholding obligation to the Company. 
 
 It is the Company s intention that the Participant s tax obligations under this Section 8 shall be satisfied through the procedure of Subsection (c) above, unless the Company provides notice of an alternate procedure under this Section, in its discretion. The Company shall not deliver any shares of Common Stock to the Participant until it is satisfied that all required withholdings have been made. 
 
 9. Participant Acknowledgements and Authorizations . The Participant acknowledges the following 
 
 (a) The Company is not by the Plan or this Award obligated to continue the Participant as an employee of the Company or an Affiliate.
