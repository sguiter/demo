All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In many cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, targets, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar words. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements about: 
 competition from other wind blade and wind turbine manufacturers; 

the discovery of defects in our products and our ability to estimate the future cost of warranty campaigns; 

the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents to meet our liquidity needs; 

the increasing cost and availability of additional capital, should such capital be needed; 

our projected sales and costs, including materials costs and capital expenditures, during the current fiscal year;

the current status of the wind energy market and our addressable market; 

our ability to absorb or mitigate the impact of price increases in resin, carbon reinforcements (or fiber), other raw materials and related logistics costs that we use to produce our products; 

our ability to absorb or mitigate the impact of wage inflation in the countries in which we operate; 

our ability to procure adequate supplies of raw materials and components to fulfill our wind blade volume commitments to our customers; 

the potential impact of the increasing prevalence of auction-based tenders in the wind energy market and increased competition from solar energy on our gross margins and overall financial performance; 

our future financial performance, including our net sales, cost of goods sold, gross profit or gross margin, operating expenses, ability to generate positive cash flow and ability to achieve or maintain profitability; 

changes in domestic or international government or regulatory policy, including without limitation, changes in trade policy and energy policy; 

changes in global economic trends and uncertainty, geopolitical risks, and demand or supply disruptions from global events; 

changes in macroeconomic and market conditions, including the potential impact of any pandemic, risk of recession, rising interest rates and inflation, supply chain constraints, commodity prices and exchange rates, and the impact of such changes on our business and results of operations; 

our ability to attract and retain customers for our products, and to optimize product pricing; 

our ability to effectively manage our growth strategy and future expenses, including our startup and transition costs; 

our ability to successfully expand in our existing wind energy markets and into new international wind energy markets, including our ability to expand our field service inspection and repair services business; 

our ability to keep up with market changes and innovations; 

our ability to successfully open new manufacturing facilities and expand existing facilities on time and on budget;

These forward-looking statements are only predictions. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to materially differ from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. We have described in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 22, 2024 the principal risks and uncertainties that we believe could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as guarantees of future events. 
 The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent our views as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or developments after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments we may make.

The assets held for sale primarily relate to net property, plant and equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable.

 million non-cash impairment charge related to property, plant and equipment, and a million loss on sale of the discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The divestiture constituted a strategic shift as the Company will focus entirely on executing on its core business in the wind industry going forward, and accordingly, the historical results of our Automotive subsidiary have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In December 2022, we committed to a restructuring plan to rebalance our organization and optimize our global manufacturing footprint. Changing economic and geopolitical factors, including increased logistics costs and tariffs imposed on components of wind turbines from China, including wind blades, had an adverse impact on demand and profitability for our wind blades manufactured in our Chinese facilities. In connection with our restructuring plan, we ceased production at our Yangzhou, China manufacturing facility as of December 31, 2022 and are in the process of shutting down our business operations in China. Our business operations in China comprised the entirety of our "Asia" reporting segment. The shut down had a meaningful effect on our global manufacturing footprint and consolidated financial results. Accordingly, the historical results of our Asia reporting segment have been presented as discontinued operations in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

For a further discussion regarding our operating segments, see Note 15, Segment Reporting . Contract Assets and Liabilities Contract assets consist of the amount of revenue recognized over time for performance obligations in production where control has transferred to the customer, but the contract does not yet allow for the customer to be billed. Typically, customers are billed when the product finishes production and meets the technical specifications contained in the contract. The majority of the contract asset balance relates to materials procured based on customer specifications. The contract assets are recorded as current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Contract liabilities consist of advance payments in excess of revenue earned. The contract liabilities are recorded as current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are reduced as we record revenue over time. These contract assets and liabilities are reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets net on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.

 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in customer specific material purchases and incremental unbilled production related to startups and transitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Gross contract liabilities decreased by million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in customer advances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized million of revenue related to customer advances, which was included in the corresponding contract liability balance at the beginning of the period. Performance Obligations Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price for which work has not been performed and excludes any unexercised contract options. The transaction price includes estimated variable consideration as determined based on the estimated production output within the range of the contractual guaranteed minimum volume obligations and production capacity. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations to be satisfied in future periods was approximately billion.

of the participants contributions up to percent of eligible compensation, and these employer matching contributions are vested immediately. In Mexico, we maintain an annual savings fund, which matches the employee contribution each week, based on the Mexican statutory maximum of of actual minimum salary rates. The savings fund period runs from November to October each year, and is distributed to employees in full, during the first week of November each year. Defined Benefit Plans In T rkiye we provide benefits for virtually all employee terminations, including retirements and voluntary and involuntary terminations, for employees who have completed at least one year of service. The annual net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligations related to this plan are determined annually on December 31, unless a remeasurement event occurs in an interim period. This determination requires assumptions to be made concerning general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), increases to compensation levels, and service period trends. Changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience can result in a change in the net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligations. If actual experience differs from these assumptions, the difference is recorded as an actuarial gain or loss and amortized into earnings over a period of time based on the average future service period, which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits to increase or decrease.

The increased income tax provision during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted primarily from the change in the mix of earnings of foreign jurisdictions. No changes in tax law occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , which had a material impact on our income tax provision. We do not record a deferred tax liability related to unremitted earnings as we maintain our assertion to indefinitely reinvest our unremitted foreign earnings.

 million. The alleged voidance claims relate to payments that Senvion made to us for wind blades that we produced prior to Senvion filing for insolvency protection. We filed a response to these alleged voidance claims in August 2021 and filed a supplemental response in April 2022. In November 2022, the court appointed an independent expert to assess whether Senvion was solvent at the time of the relevant payments. The independent expert has not yet submitted its assessment to the court. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the alleged voidance claims. Due to the current procedural posture of this claim, we have determined that the ultimate outcome cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those described in or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or in our previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, particularly those under the heading Risk Factors. 
 OVERVIEW 
 Our Company 
 We are the only independent manufacturer of composite wind blades for the wind energy market with a global manufacturing footprint. We deliver high-quality, cost-effective composite solutions through long-term relationships with leading original equipment manufacturers (OEM) in the wind market. We also provide field service inspection and repair services to our OEM customers and wind farm owners and operators. We are headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona and operate factories in the U.S., Mexico, T rkiye, and India. We operate additional engineering development centers in Denmark and Germany and a services facility in Spain. 
 Our business operations are defined geographically into four geographic operating segments (1) the United States (U.S.), (2) Mexico, (3) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and (4) India. See Note 15, Segment Reporting , to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more details about our operating segments. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 In June 2024, we completed the divestiture of our wholly-owned subsidiary, TPI, Inc. (the Automotive subsidiary) for cash proceeds of one US Dollar. The Automotive subsidiary was engaged in the development, commercialization and implementation of the Company s automotive industry related products. The Automotive subsidiary was previously classified as held for sale in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. As a result of the divestiture, the Company recorded a 19.7 million non-cash impairment charge related to property, plant and equipment, and a 6.3 million loss on sale of the discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The divestiture constituted a strategic shift as the Company will focus entirely on executing on its core business in the wind industry going forward, and accordingly, the historical results of our Automotive subsidiary have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 KEY TRENDS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS 
 
 Geopolitical events around the world have accelerated regional needs for energy independence and security. Climate change also continues to drive the need for renewable energy solutions and net-zero carbon emissions. The global demand for clean energy continues to rise, driven by factors such as the growing need for data centers, semiconductor chip manufacturers, the adoption of electric vehicles, and the electrification of buildings. Over the course of the past few years, we have seen numerous government policy initiatives aimed at expanding the use of renewable energy, including the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA) in the U.S. and several policy initiatives in the EU that are expected to simplify regulations, speed up permitting and promote cross-border projects to accelerate climate neutrality. We expect these recent trends in governmental policy will enable long-term revenue growth in the wind industry. As the majority of our wind blades are installed in the U.S. and Europe, these policy trends are expected to have a material impact on our business and the pace of long-term growth. 
 
 Despite these favorable long-term policy trends, we expect demand in the near term will not significantly improve while the wind industry goes through the process of implementing key provisions of the IRA and awaits more robust policies in the EU. In addition, permitting, transmission, transmission queues, the ability of the broader wind industry supply chain to ramp volume, elevated interest rates and inflation, and the cost and availability of capital are further factors limiting the timing of the wind market recovery. 
 
 As the onshore wind market recovers, we expect sales of our wind blades to increase moderately in 2025 as our lines that are in startup and transition in 2024 will achieve serial production to meet projected customer demand for wind blades in the U.S. market, partially offset by lower forecasted demand for wind blades in the European market. While long-term onshore market growth in Europe remains in sight, the economic viability of pursuing that demand with European-based manufacturing is becoming increasingly challenging. Historically, we have serviced the European market with our plants in T rkiye. The hyperinflationary environment we 
 25 

have experienced in T rkiye for the last number of years is not expected to subside any time soon. In addition, T rkiye s monetary policy continues to limit Turkish Lira devaluation, resulting in a very challenging environment to export goods out of T rkiye. Furthermore, while we have successfully competed with Chinese blade manufacturers for years, their recent aggressive push to expand their presence in Europe and other regions outside of North America, supported by their government's backing, has added to the challenging competitive environment outside of the U.S. Unlike the U.S., which has implemented tariffs to protect against unfair competition and tax laws to encourage near shoring and domestic manufacturing, we believe it is unlikely that European governments will take similar steps to meaningfully help suppliers like TPI that supply passive components to our OEM customers. 
 
 Ongoing inflationary pressures have caused and may continue to cause many of our production expenses to increase, which adversely impacts our results of operations. The government of Mexico increased minimum wages 20 effective January 1, 2024. The government of T rkiye increased minimum wages 49 effective January 1, 2024. While our customer contracts allow us to pass a portion of these increases to our customers, we will not be able to recover 100 of the increased labor costs caused by this wage inflation. If our manufacturing facilities in these countries continue to experience wage inflation at these levels, and the increased costs in local currency are not offset by favorable foreign currency fluctuations or productivity improvements, such elevated wages will have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 
 Effective June 30, 2024, we shut down the Matamoros, Mexico manufacturing facility for Nordex that we took over from them in July 2021. Our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were adversely impacted by the performance of this facility in the first half of the year due to higher than anticipated losses driven by cancelled orders and production inefficiencies resulting from Nordex s request for us to shut down the plant at the conclusion of the contract on June 30, 2024, including releasing all associates working in the factory. While Nordex funded all of our severance costs for the headcount reduction, our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by significantly less demand from Nordex than expected and production inefficiencies relating to the closure of the facility. We experienced a loss from operations of 33.6 million at this facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a loss from operations of 25.6 million at this facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in this loss from operations compared to the prior year was primarily due to a 50 decrease for the nine-month period in the volume of wind blades produced, due to environmental conditions at this facility affecting production in early 2024, cancelled orders and inefficiencies resulting from the closure of the facility in the second quarter of 2024. The loss from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was reduced by the impact of 5.0 million in additional fees received from Nordex related to the cancelled orders and production inefficiencies during the closure of the facility. 
 
 We are exploring alternatives for the divestiture of our tooling business as part of our continued prioritization of capital for growth in the wind blade business, and as of September 30, 2024, we met the criteria to classify 5.0 million of assets and 1.1 million of liabilities as held for sale in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The assets held for sale primarily relate to net property, plant and equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable. The liabilities held for sale primarily relate to accounts payable and other accrued expenses. Upon classifying the assets as held for sale, we recognized 3.9 million of impairment charges during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 KEY METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE 
 In addition to measures of financial performance presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we use certain other financial measures and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures consist of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and net cash (debt), which help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, assess operational efficiencies, oversee our overall liquidity, and evaluate our overall financial performance. The key operating metrics consist of wind blade sets produced, estimated megawatts of energy capacity to be generated by wind blade sets produced, utilization, dedicated manufacturing lines, manufacturing lines installed, and weighted-average sales price (ASP) per wind blade, all of which help us evaluate our operational performance. We believe that these measures are useful to investors in evaluating our performance. For a detailed discussion of our key financial measures and our key operating metrics, refer to the discussion in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Key Metrics Used By Management To Measure Performance included in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The increase in net sales of wind blades, tooling and other wind related sales (collectively, Wind) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to higher average sales prices of wind blades due to changes in the mix of wind blade models produced, in particular the startup of production at one of our previously idled facilities in Juarez, Mexico, an increase in wind blade inventory included in contract assets driven by the startups and transitions, and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. The increase in wind blade inventory directly correlates to higher sales under the cost-to-cost revenue recognition method for our wind blade contracts. This increase was partially offset by a 10 decrease for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 in the number of wind blades produced due primarily to the number and pace of startups and transitions and expected volume declines based on market activity levels. The decrease in Wind sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a 21 decrease for the nine-month period in the number of wind blades produced due primarily to the number and pace of startups and transitions, expected volume declines based on market activity levels, and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. This decrease was partially offset by higher average sales prices of wind blades due to changes in the mix of wind blade models produced, in particular the startup of production at one of our previously idled facilities in Juarez, Mexico. The increase in field service, inspection and repair services (collectively, Field Services) sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to an increase in technicians deployed to revenue generating projects as our technicians decreased their time spent on non-revenue generating inspection and repair activities. The decrease in Field Services sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a reduction in technicians deployed to revenue generating projects due to an increase in time spent on non-revenue generating inspection and repair activities in the first half of 2024. The fluctuating U.S. dollar relative to the Euro had a favorable impact of 0.3 and 0.1 , respectively, on consolidated net sales during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.

The increase in Field Services sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to an increase in technicians deployed to revenue generating projects and less time spent on non-revenue generating projects as inspection and repair activities slow down. The decrease in Field Services sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a reduction in technicians deployed to revenue generating projects in the first half of 2024 due to an increase in time spent on non-revenue generating inspection and repair activities in the first half of 2024.

The increase in the Mexico segment s Wind sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to higher average sales prices of wind blades in Mexico due to changes in the mix of wind blade models produced, the impact of wage inflation on wind blade prices, an increase in wind blade inventory included in contract assets driven by startups and transitions, and a 1 net increase in the number of wind blades produced across our Mexico facilities. The increase in wind blade inventory in the Mexico segment directly correlates to higher sales under the cost-to-cost revenue recognition method for our wind blade contracts. 
 
 The increase in the Mexico segment s Wind sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to higher average sales prices of wind blades due to changes in the mix of wind blade models produced, partially offset by a 12 net decrease in the number of wind blades produced across our Mexico facilities. The change in volume was primarily associated with decreased production at one of our Matamoros, Mexico manufacturing facilities due to the transition of several of the manufacturing lines at this facility to larger wind blade models that have not yet achieved serial production levels. The change in volume was also due to a decrease in the number of wind blades produced at the Nordex Matamoros facility that shut down at the conclusion of the contract on June 30, 2024. These decreases were partially offset by a combined 6 increase in volume across our facilities in Juarez, Mexico, including the restart of production at one of our previously idled facilities.

The decrease in the EMEA segment s Wind sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to a 15 and 30 decrease, for the three and nine month periods, respectively, in the number of wind blades produced due to reduced demand from one of our customers and the transition of certain manufacturing lines to a different customers' wind blade model, as well as unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. These decreases were partially offset by higher average sales prices of wind blades in T rkiye due to such changes in the mix of wind blade models produced. The fluctuating U.S. dollar relative to the Euro had a favorable impact of 0.9 and 0.4 on the EMEA segment's net sales, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023.

Total cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased by approximately 1.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by the shutdown of our Nordex Matamoros facility at the end of the second quarter of 2024 which had significant cost challenges in the prior comparative period, a decrease in warranty costs, and a decrease in transition costs as we made progress on the transition of four manufacturing lines at our other Matamoros, Mexico facility. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in startup costs associated with four manufacturing lines in Juarez, Mexico at a previously idle manufacturing facility, and increased labor costs in T rkiye and Mexico as a result of wage increases. The fluctuating U.S. dollar against the Euro, Turkish Lira, Mexican Peso and Indian Rupee had a combined favorable impact of 3.0 on consolidated cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Total cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 1.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by an increase in startup and transition costs associated with four manufacturing lines in Juarez, Mexico at a previously idle manufacturing facility, two manufacturing lines in transition at one of our T rkiye facilities where two longer blade models are replacing three blade models due to space considerations, and four manufacturing lines in transition at one of our Matamoros, Mexico manufacturing facilities. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was also due to increased labor costs in T rkiye and Mexico as a result of wage increases. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in warranty costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, due to the 32.7 million warranty charge recorded in the second quarter of the prior year. The fluctuating U.S. dollar against the Euro, Turkish Lira, Mexican Peso and Indian Rupee had a combined favorable impact of 4.1 on consolidated cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.

The increase in loss on sale of assets and asset impairments for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to 3.9 million of asset impairments associated with our tooling business in Mexico. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in the volume of receivables sold through our accounts receivable financing arrangements with certain of our customers in the first half of 2024.

U.S. Segment 
 The increase in loss from operations in the U.S. segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to increases in professional services and consulting fees. This loss was partially offset by a decrease in employee compensation costs, reduced share-based compensation and depreciation expenses. The increase in the loss from operations in the U.S. segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a reduction in field services sales in the first half of 2024 as technicians spent more time on non-revenue generating inspection and repair activities. 
 Mexico Segment 
 The decrease in loss from operations in the Mexico segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to the shutdown of our Nordex Matamoros facility at the end of the second quarter of 2024, which had significant cost challenges in the prior comparative period, as well as higher average sales prices in the current period due to a change in the mix of wind blades, and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. This was partially offset by a decrease in the volume of wind blades produced, increased startup and transition costs, increased labor costs, and continued cost challenges at our other facility in Matamoros, Mexico. The fluctuating U.S. dollar relative to the Mexican Peso had a favorable impact of 2.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 EMEA Segment 
 The decrease in income from operations in the EMEA segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to a 15 and 30 decrease, for the three and nine month periods, respectively, in the volume of wind blades produced, increased startup and transition costs, inflation impacting operating costs that we were not able to pass on to our customers, and increased labor costs as a result of wage increases in T rkiye. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in wind blade prices, cost savings initiatives, and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. The fluctuating U.S. dollar relative to the Turkish Lira and Euro had a favorable impact of 5.9 and 13.8 , respectively, on the EMEA segment's cost of goods sold for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 India Segment 
 The decrease in income from operations in the India segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to a 24 decrease for both the three and nine month periods respectively, in the volume of wind blades produced and lower average sales prices.

The decrease in net loss from discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to the impacts of credit losses and impairment charges at our Automotive subsidiary in the prior comparative period because of the Proterra bankruptcy in August 2023. The decrease in net loss from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to the same reasons set forth above, partially offset by the impacts of our divestiture of our Automotive subsidiary in June 2024, which resulted in approximately 19.7 million of asset impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment, and 6.3 million of loss on the sale of discontinued operations. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our primary needs for liquidity have been, and in the future will continue to be, capital expenditures, purchases of raw materials, new facility startup costs, the impact of line startups and transitions, working capital, debt service costs, warranty costs and restructuring costs associated with the optimization of our global footprint. Our capital expenditures have been primarily related to machinery and equipment for new facilities or facility expansions. Historically, we have funded our working capital needs through cash flows from operations, the proceeds received from our credit facilities and term debt, and proceeds received from the issuance of stock. 
 We had net proceeds under all of our various financing arrangements of 62.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net proceeds under our financing arrangements of 111.6 million in the comparable period of 2023, primarily due to the issuance of the Convertible Notes in the prior comparative period. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 605.8 million and 485.2 million in outstanding indebtedness, net of issuance costs and debt discount, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, 139.8 million of outstanding indebtedness, consisting primarily of our working capital facilities in T rkiye and India, matures within the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of 25.3 million of remaining capacity for cash and non-cash financing, including 19.1 million of remaining availability for cash borrowing under our various credit facilities. Based upon current and anticipated levels of operations, we believe that cash on hand, available credit facilities, and cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to make required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness over the next twelve months. 
 We anticipate that any new facilities and future facility expansions will be funded through cash flows from operations, the incurrence of other indebtedness and other potential sources of liquidity. The 11 senior secured term loan contains certain covenants and rights including, but not limited to, amount of indebtedness, capital expenditure limitations, a U.S. cash on hand balance requirement of 40.0 million through September 30, 2024 and 50.0 million thereafter. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling 125.9 million and 161.1 million, respectively. The September 30, 2024 balance includes 51.5 million of cash located outside of the United States, including 45.0 million in T rkiye, 4.6 million in India, 1.3 million in Mexico and 0.6 million in other countries. The December 31, 2023 balance included 45.0 million of cash located outside of the U.S., including 40.6 million in T rkiye, 1.9 million in India, 1.2 million in Mexico and 1.3 million in other countries. In addition to these amounts, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had 0.7 million and 0.9 million, respectively, of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents related to our discontinued operations which is held outside of the U.S. 
 35 

Financing Facilities 
 Our total principal amount of debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 702.9 million and 606.1 million, respectively, including our convertible senior notes, secured and unsecured financing, working capital and term loan agreements and equipment finance leases. See Note 6, Debt , to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more details on our debt balances.

Operating Cash Flows 
 Net cash used in operating activities decreased by 11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to changes in net working capital in the current period and higher payments in the first quarter of the prior comparative period related to restructuring activities associated with the shutdown of our China operations at the end of 2022, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes and cash paid for interest. 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase of 6.3 million in capital expenditures for the startup and transition of our manufacturing lines at our facilities in Mexico and T rkiye and 12.8 million associated with the sale of our Taicang, China facility in the prior year. 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by 48.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the proceeds from the Convertible Notes in the prior comparative period, partially offset by increased borrowings under our T rkiye and India working capital facilities in the current period. 
 We are not presently involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including transactions with unconsolidated special-purpose or other entities that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, other than our accounts receivable assignment agreements described below. Furthermore, we do not have any relationships with special-purpose or other entities that provide off-balance sheet financing; liquidity, market risk or credit risk support; or engage in leasing or other services that may expose us to liability or risks of loss that are not reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. 
 Our segments enter into accounts receivable assignment agreements with various financial institutions. Under these agreements, the financial institution buys, on a non-recourse basis, the accounts receivable amounts related to our segments' customers at an agreed-upon discount rate.

The following table summarizes certain key details of each of the accounts receivable assignment agreements in place as of September 30, 2024:

As the receivables are purchased by the financial institutions under the agreements noted above, the receivables are removed from our condensed consolidated balance sheet. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 240.5 million and 459.6 million, respectively, of receivables were sold under the accounts receivable assignment agreements described above as compared to 278.2 million and 785.9 million, respectively, in the comparative prior year period. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 3. QUANTIT ATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. These market risks are principally limited to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. We conduct international operations in Mexico, T rkiye, India and Europe. Our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction risk and currency translation risk. We incur currency transaction risk whenever we enter into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency other than the functional currency of the transacting entity. With respect to currency translation risk, our financial condition and results of operations are measured and recorded in the relevant functional currency and then translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our condensed consolidated financial statements. In recent years, exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future. A hypothetical change of 10 in the exchange rates for the countries above would have resulted in a change to income from operations of approximately 10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Commodity Price Risk . We are subject to commodity price risk under agreements for the supply of our raw materials. We have not hedged our commodity price exposure. We generally lock in pricing for most of our key raw materials for 12 months which protects us from price increases within that period, which we believe helps to mitigate the impact of raw material price increases. As many of our raw material supply agreements have meet or release clauses, if raw materials prices decrease, we are able to benefit from the reductions in price. 
 Resin, resin systems, and carbon fiber are the primary commodities for which we do not have fixed pricing. Approximately 52 of the resin and resin systems, and approximately 71 of the carbon fiber, we use is purchased under contracts either controlled or borne by two of our customers and therefore they receive/bear 100 of any decrease or increase in resin and carbon fiber costs further limiting our exposure to price fluctuations. 
 Taking into account the contractual obligations of our customers to share with us the cost savings or increases resulting from a change in the current forecasted price of resin, resin systems, and carbon fiber, we believe that a 10 change in the current forecasted price of resin, resin systems and carbon fiber for the customers in which we are exposed to fluctuating prices would have an impact to income from operations of approximately 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. With respect to our other customer supply agreements, our customers typically receive approximately 70 of the cost savings or increases resulting from a change in the price of resin, resin systems and carbon fiber. 
 Interest Rate Risk. As of September 30, 2024, all remaining secured and unsecured financing and finance lease obligations are fixed rate instruments and are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates. 
 37 

Item 4. CONTROLS AN D PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the design and operating effectiveness as of September 30, 2024 of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
