Proceedings

course of business. Any of these claims could subject the Company to costly legal expenses and, while management generally believes that
there will be adequate insurance to cover different liabilities at such time the Company becomes a public company and commences clinical
trials, the Company s future insurance carriers may deny coverage or policy limits may be inadequate to fully satisfy any damage
awards or settlements. If this were to happen, the payment of any such awards could have a material adverse effect on the results of
operations and financial position. Additionally, any such claims, whether or not successful, could damage the Company s reputation
and business. The Company is currently not a party to any legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, in management s opinion,
individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).
All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding the future
financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The
words believe, may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, 
 intend, should, plan, expect, and similar expressions, as they relate to us,
are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on current expectations and
projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business
strategy and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. 

In
addition, our business and financial performance may be affected by the factors that are discussed under Risk Factors in
the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed on April 15, 2024. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive
and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risk factors,
nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual
results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. 

You
should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the events and circumstances
reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. 

The
following discussion and analysis is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information
set forth in the condensed financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This
discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any
conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the
best present assessment of our management. 

Overview 

We
are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on our Phase III clinical trial, Flamingo-01, which is evaluating GLSI-100, an
immunotherapy to prevent breast cancer recurrences. GP2 is a 9 amino acid transmembrane peptide of the HER2/neu protein, a cell surface
receptor protein that is expressed in a variety of common cancers, including expression in 75 of breast cancers at low (1+), intermediate
(2+), and high (3+ or over-expressor) levels. The combination of GP2 + GM-CSF is called GLSI-100. We are currently expanding Flamingo-01
into Europe with plans to open up to 150 sites globally. Flamingo-01 is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GLSI-100 in HER2 /neu
 positive patients with residual disease or high-risk pathologic complete response at surgery and who have completed both neoadjuvant
and postoperative adjuvant trastuzumab based treatment. 

To
date, we have not generated any revenue and we have incurred net losses. Our net losses were approximately 8.9 million and 7.8 million
for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively and 7.7 million and 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Our
net losses have resulted from costs incurred in developing the drug in our pipeline, planning and preparing for clinical trials and general
and administrative activities associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and corresponding increased
operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop our pipeline. Our costs may further increase as we conduct clinical
trials and seek regulatory approval for and prepare to commercialize our product candidate. We expect to incur significant expenses to
continue to build the infrastructure necessary to support our expanded operations, clinical trials, commercialization, including manufacturing,
marketing, sales and distribution functions. We will also experience increased costs associated with operating as a public company.

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses increased by 133,873 or 6 , to 2,292,040 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2,158,167 for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in clinical expenses. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses increased by 92,253, or 27 , to 437,011 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 344,758 for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in finance expenses. 

Results
of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses increased by 1,428,785, or 27 , to 6,794,426 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5,365,641
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in clinical expenses. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses increased by 7,038, or 1 , to 1,133,230 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,126,192 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Since
our inception in 2006, we have devoted most of our cash resources to research and development and general and administrative activities.
We have not yet achieved commercialization of our product and have a cumulative net loss from our operations. We will continue to incur
net losses for the foreseeable future. Our condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going
concern. 

We
will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through the sale
of equity and/or debt securities; however, there is no assurance that we will be successful at raising additional capital in the future.
If our plans are not achieved and/or if significant unanticipated events occur, we may have to further modify our business plan, which
may require us to raise additional capital. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our principal source of liquidity was our
cash, which totaled 5,822,367 and 6,989,424, respectively, and additional loans and accrued unreimbursed expenses from related parties.
Historically, our principal sources of cash have included proceeds from the sale of common stock and preferred stock and related party
loans. Our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations. We expect that the principal uses of cash in the future will
be for continuing operations, funding of research and development, including our clinical trials, and general working capital requirements.
The Company s existing cash resources are expected to provide sufficient funds to carry the Company s planned operations
over the next 12 months from the date these condensed financial statements were issued. 

On October 7, 2024, we entered into an At The Market
Offering Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC pursuant to which we may sell up to 100 million of common stock in an At
the Market offering through a Form S-3 shelf registration statement which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange
Agreement on October 17, 2024. 

On September 18, 2024, we terminated the Open Market Sale Agreement,
dated July 12, 2022 between us and Jefferies LLC. 

Cash
Flow Activities for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

We
incurred net losses of 7,748,590 and 6,145,064 during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase
was primarily the result of an increase in clinical expenses. 

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 5,414,337 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 4,324,407 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Investing
Activities 

We
did not use or generate cash from investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

On
June 13, 2024, the Company completed a private placement offering of shares of its common stock to its CEO and principal stockholder
for net proceeds of 2,499,998. No investment banking fees were paid in connection with the offering. 

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material contractual obligations, other than employment and shareholder agreements and our
license for GP2 from HJF. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as described by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
condensed financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the condensed financial
statements, and the reported amounts of expenses in the periods presented. 

On
an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and stock-based compensation.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts
of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates, particularly given the
significant social and economic disruptions and uncertainties associated with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the COVID-19 control
responses. 

Recent
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments. The main objective of the standard is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the
expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date.
To achieve this objective, the amendments in this standard replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology
that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform
credit loss estimates. The update is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2023 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted
the standard on January 1, 2023. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company s audited financial
statements and related disclosures. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

In
October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06 Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC s Disclosure Update and Simplification
Initiative. The main objective of the amendment is to modify the disclosure or presentation requirements of various Topics in the Codification.
Certain amendments represent clarifications to or technical corrections of the current requirements. to eliminate disclosure requirements
that were redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded. The effective date for each amendment will be when the SEC s
removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. The Company
is still evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard.

April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take
advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay
the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 

We
have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act.
As a result, our condensed financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective
dates for complying with new or revised accounting standards. 

Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions,
including, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial
reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s
report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total
annual gross revenues of 1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the
completion of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during
the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are not required to
provide the information required under this Item 3.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal accounting and financial officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
accounting and financial officer has concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting due to inadequate segregation of
duties within account processes due to limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT and financial
reporting and record keeping. Under the direction of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer,
we are developing a plan to remediate the material weaknesses. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management
does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and fraud. Any control system,
no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or
fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may be subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to
any material legal proceedings and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have
a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS

have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
