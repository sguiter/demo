Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report reflect all of the assets, liabilities and results of operations of Calumet, Inc. Calumet, the Company, we, our, or us ). The following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Stockholders should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our 2023 Annual Report and our historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Overview We manufacture, formulate and market a diversified slate of specialty branded products and renewable fuels to customers across a broad range of consumer-facing and industrial markets. We are headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana and operate twelve facilities throughout North America. Our operations are managed using the following reportable segments: Specialty Products and Solutions; Performance Brands; Montana/Renewables; and Corporate. For additional information, see Note 12 Segments and Related Information under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In our Specialty Products and Solutions segment, we manufacture and market a wide variety of solvents, waxes, customized lubricating oils, white oils, petrolatums, gels, esters, and other products. Our specialty products are sold to domestic and international customers who purchase them primarily as raw material components for consumer-facing and industrial products. In our Performance Brands segment, we blend, package and market high performance products through our Royal Purple, Bel-Ray, and TruFuel brands. Our Montana/Renewables segment is comprised of two facilities renewable fuels and specialty asphalt. At our Great Falls renewable fuels facility, we process a variety of geographically advantaged renewable feedstocks into renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, renewable hydrogen, renewable natural gas, renewable propane, and renewable naphtha that are distributed into renewable markets in the western half of North America. At our Montana specialty asphalt facility, we process Canadian crude oil into conventional gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and specialty grades of asphalt, with production sized to serve local markets. Our Corporate segment primarily consists of general and administrative expenses not allocated to the Specialty Products and Solutions, Performance Brands or Montana/Renewables segments. Recent Developments On July 10, 2024, the Company completed the previously announced conversion transaction contemplated by the Conversion Agreement, dated as of February 9, 2024 (as amended, the Conversion Agreement ), by and among the Company, the General Partner, Calumet, Inc. New Calumet ), Calumet Merger Sub I LLC Merger Sub I ), Calumet Merger Sub II LLC Merger Sub II and the other parties thereto, including The Heritage Group (the Sponsor Parties ). Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, (a) Merger Sub II merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of New Calumet, and all of the common units were exchanged into the right to receive an equal number of shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, of New Calumet Common Stock and (b) Merger Sub I merged with and into the General Partner, with the General Partner continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of New Calumet, and all outstanding equity interests of the General Partner (1,640,583 general partner units) were exchanged into the right to receive an aggregate of 5,500,000 shares of Common Stock and 2,000,000 warrants to purchase common stock at an exercise price of 20.00 per share (subject to adjustment). Third Quarter 2024 Update Outlook and Trends During the third quarter of 2024, our business continued to benefit from strong production volumes. In the third quarter, we achieved multiple production milestones, including the highest production levels in over five years in our specialties business, while we also processed approximately 12,000 barrels per day of renewable feedstock and over 2,500 barrels per day of SAF in our Montana Renewables business. Our Montana Renewables business achieved a new SAF 

 43 

Table of Contents 
 production record each month during the quarter, culminating with approximately 3,200 barrels per day of SAF production in September. Additionally, we continue to benefit from enhanced operational performance in all of our businesses as a result of the capital investments we have made over the past few years on projects designed to improve the reliability of our assets. In our Specialties Products and Solutions and Performance Brands segments, we continue to benefit from an attractive specialty product margin environment, which has proved resilient despite the weakened commodity margin environment which has hampered results for our fuel based products. Demand for our products in these businesses remained strong in comparison to historical averages and we continue to leverage the benefits of our fully integrated specialty business in this market. As expected, margins continue to normalize relative to the record highs experienced in the second half of 2022 and early 2023. We expect the current margin environment for both specialty products and fuel based products to continue for the remainder of the year. Further, we believe low unemployment and stabilizing raw material and packaging costs point to a continuation of healthy demand for the majority of our products. While the risk of recession and inflation continue to be monitored, our plants and the industry are expected to operate at high rates to meet market demand. In our Montana/Renewables segment, we continue to see strong demand for our renewable fuel products. We maintain our outlook of strong demand for renewable fuel products, including those we produce at our Montana Renewables facility. We believe demand for renewable fuel products will only continue to grow as a result of the rapid expansion of corporate decarbonization targets, broad sustainability initiatives, and governmental mandates and incentives that have been passed or announced by national, state, and provincial jurisdictions across the globe. In light of the global decarbonization initiatives, forecasts of future availability still fall short of the necessary emissions reductions that would be required to reach established net-zero goals, as adequate supply does not exist yet. For example, our Montana Renewables facility is one of the only facilities in Norh America capable of SAF production at scale in North America today. We believe that our position as a first-mover makes us the key producer for potential offtake partners to help them reach their announced targets. The Great Falls facility expects to conduct a planned turnaround in November to change catalyst. This timing allows completion prior to the winter season and was planned to coincide with a period of margin uncertainty as the blender tax credit is expected to change to the production tax credit. Our Montana specialty asphalt facility continues to be impacted by WCS inflationary pressure, but remains strategically advantaged due to its local access to cost-advantaged Canadian conventional crude oil, while producing additional fuels and refined products for delivery into the regional market. Due to its strategic location and logistical capabilities, we believe that our Montana specialty asphalt facility is well-positioned to continue to serve long-standing customers in the regional market. As we have experienced in the past several years, our integrated business model and diversified product portfolio provides an advantaged response to changing market conditions. While we are not immune to the impacts of an economic downturn, we believe our specialty business is well positioned in periods of raw material volatility, which can negatively impact short-term margins, and a variety of economic conditions. Contingencies For a summary of litigation and other contingencies, please read Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on information available to us at the present time, we do not believe that any liabilities beyond the amounts already accrued, which may result from these contingencies, will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Financial Results We reported a net loss of 100.6 million in the third quarter 2024 versus net income of 99.8 million in the third quarter 2023. We reported Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Note 12 Segments and Related Information under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of 49.8 million in the third quarter 2024 versus 75.4 million in the third quarter 2023.

Specialty Products and Solutions segment Adjusted EBITDA was 42.6 million in the third quarter 2024 versus 38.6 million in the third quarter 2023. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, Specialty Products and Solutions third quarter 2024 segment Adjusted EBITDA was favorably impacted by higher throughput volumes as a result of improved operational performance and the absence of maintenance activities that were completed at our Shreveport facility during the prior year period. Current period production volumes increased in comparison to the prior year period, despite experiencing unplanned downtime in July as a result of Hurricane Beryl. Current period results in our fuels business were unfavorably impacted by the lower commodity margin environment that has impacted the broader industry. Montana/Renewables segment Adjusted EBITDA was 12.7 million in the third quarter 2024 versus 38.2 million in the third quarter 2023. Our current quarter results were favorably impacted by strong operations at MRL throughout the quarter, where we processed approximately 12,000 barrels per day of renewable feedstock and over 2,500 barrels per day of SAF. Further, a new SAF production record was achieved each month during the current quarter, culminating with approximately 3,200 barrels per day of SAF produced in September. Results for the segment were unfavorably impacted by a decrease to margins from feedstock price lag when the industry saw these prices abruptly drop approximately 0.40 per gallon in late July. Our legacy specialty asphalt plant posted lower results as fuel spreads tightened, despite strong retail asphalt sales. Performance Brands segment Adjusted EBITDA was 13.6 million in the third quarter 2024 versus 13.2 million in the third quarter 2023. Results in our Performance Brands segment were favorably impacted from the strong volume growth across high performance products, in particular our TruFuel product line and our integrated industrial business. This segment continues to benefit from strong unit margins, reflective of stabilized input costs in our branded and consumer markets and a focus on growing our presence in industrial markets. Total Corporate costs represented a loss of 19.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter 2024 versus a loss of 14.6 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter 2023 due to higher labor and benefits related expenses. Liquidity Update As of September 30, 2024, we had total liquidity of 289.8 million comprised of 34.6 million of unrestricted cash and 255.2 million of availability under our credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, our revolving credit facilities had a 508.4 million borrowing base, 27.3 million in outstanding standby letters of credit and 225.9 million of outstanding borrowings. We believe we will continue to have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, projected cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity and other means by which to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies, and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Please read Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information. Renewable Fuel Standard Update Along with the broader refining industry, we remain subject to compliance costs under the RFS unless or until we receive a small refinery exemption from the EPA, which we have historically received. Administered by the EPA, the RFS provides annual requirements for the total volume of renewable transportation fuels that are mandated to be blended into finished transportation fuels. If a refiner does not meet its required annual Renewable Volume Obligation, the refiner can purchase blending credits in the open market, referred to as RINs. 

 45 

Table of Contents 
 During the third quarter 2024, we recorded an accrued expense of 42.8 million for RINs, as compared to a gain of 157.3 million for RINs in the third quarter 2023. Our gross RINs Obligation, which includes RINs that are required to be secured through either our own blending or through the purchase of RINs in the open market, is spread across four compliance categories (D3, D4, D5 and D6). The gross RINs obligations may be satisfied by our own renewables blending, RIN purchases, or receipt of small refinery exemptions. Expenses related to RFS compliance have the potential to remain a significant expense for our two segments containing fuels products. If legal or regulatory changes occur that have the effect of increasing our RINs Obligation or eliminating or narrowing the availability of the small refinery exemption under the RFS program, we could be required to purchase additional RINs in the open market, which may materially increase our costs related to RFS compliance and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for further information on the Company s RINs obligation. Unrestricted Subsidiaries See Note 14 Unrestricted Subsidiaries under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for further information regarding certain financial information of our unrestricted subsidiaries. Key Performance Measures Our sales and results of operations are principally affected by demand for specialty products, fuel product demand, renewable fuel product demand, global fuel crack spreads, the price of natural gas used as fuel in our operations, our ability to operate our production facilities at high utilization, and our results from derivative instrument activities. Our primary raw materials are crude oil, renewable feedstocks, and other specialty feedstocks, and our primary outputs are specialty consumer-facing and industrial products, specialty branded products, fuel products, and renewable fuel products. The prices of crude oil, specialty products, fuel products, and renewable fuel products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, demand, market uncertainties and a variety of factors beyond our control. We monitor these risks and from time-to-time enter into derivative instruments designed to help mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations on our business. The primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to economically hedge our cash flow exposure to commodity price risk. We also may hedge when market conditions exist that we believe to be out of the ordinary and particularly supportive of our financial goals. We enter into derivative contracts for future periods in quantities that do not exceed our projected purchases of crude oil and natural gas and sales of fuel and renewable fuel products. Please read Note 9 Derivatives under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our management uses several financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance. These measurements include the following: sales volumes; segment gross profit; segment Adjusted gross profit; segment Adjusted EBITDA; and selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 Sales volumes. We view the volumes of Specialty Products and Solutions products, Montana/Renewables products and Performance Brands products sold as an important measure of our ability to effectively utilize our operating assets. 

 46 

Table of Contents 
 Our ability to meet the demands of our customers is driven by the volumes of feedstocks that we run at our facilities. Higher volumes improve profitability both through the spreading of fixed costs over greater volumes and the additional gross profit achieved on the incremental volumes. Segment gross profit. Specialty Products and Solutions, Montana/Renewables and Performance Brands products gross profit are important measures of profitability of our segments. We define gross profit as sales less the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, LCM/LIFO adjustments, and other production-related expenses, the most significant portion of which includes labor, plant fuel, utilities, contract services, maintenance, transportation, RINs, depreciation and amortization and processing materials. We use gross profit as an indicator of our ability to manage margins in our business over the long-term. The increase or decrease in selling prices typically lags behind the rising or falling costs, respectively, of feedstocks throughout our business. Other than plant fuel, RINs mark-to-market adjustments, and LCM/LIFO adjustments, production related expenses generally remain stable across broad ranges but can fluctuate depending on maintenance activities performed during a specific period. Segment Adjusted gross profit. Specialty Products and Solutions, Montana/Renewables and Performance Brands products segment Adjusted gross profit measures are useful as they exclude transactions not related to our core cash operating activities and provide metrics to analyze the profitability of the core cash operations of our segments. We define segment Adjusted gross profit as segment gross profit excluding the impact of (a) LCM inventory adjustments; (b) the impact of liquidation of inventory layers calculated using the LIFO method; (c) RINs mark-to-market adjustments; (d) depreciation and amortization; and (e) all extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items of revenue or cost of sales. Segment Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that Specialty Products and Solutions, Montana/Renewables and Performance Brands segment Adjusted EBITDA measures are useful as they exclude transactions not related to our core cash operating activities and provide metrics to analyze our ability to pay interest to our noteholders. Adjusted EBITDA allows us to meaningfully analyze the trends and performance of our core cash operations as well as to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to segments. Corporate Adjusted EBITDA primarily reflects general and administrative costs.

We provide reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted to Net income (loss), our most directly comparable financial performance measure. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used as supplemental financial measures by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others, to assess: the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and support our indebtedness; our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing or capital structure; and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities. 
 Management believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to analysts and investors as they exclude transactions not related to our core cash operating activities and provide metrics to analyze our ability to pay interest to our noteholders. However, the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to pay distributions. We believe that excluding these transactions allows investors to meaningfully analyze trends and performance of our core cash operations.

Table of Contents 
 We define EBITDA for any period as net income (loss) plus interest expense (including amortization of debt issuance costs), income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA for any period as EBITDA adjusted for (a) impairment; (b) unrealized gains and losses from mark-to-market accounting for hedging activities; (c) realized gains and losses under derivative instruments excluded from the determination of net income (loss); (d) non-cash equity-based compensation expense and other non-cash items (excluding items such as accruals of cash expenses in a future period or amortization of a prepaid cash expense) that were deducted in computing net income (loss); (e) debt refinancing fees, extinguishment costs, premiums and penalties; (f) any net gain or loss realized in connection with an asset sale that was deducted in computing net income (loss); (g) amortization of turnaround costs; (h) LCM inventory adjustments; (i) the impact of liquidation of inventory layers calculated using the LIFO method; (j) RINs mark-to-market adjustments; and (k) all extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items of gain or loss, or revenue or expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Quarterly Report is similar to the calculation of Consolidated Cash Flow contained in the indentures governing our Senior Notes (as defined in this Quarterly Report) and the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA contained in the Credit Agreement. We are required to report Consolidated Cash Flow to the holders of our Senior Notes and Consolidated EBITDA to the lenders under our revolving credit facility, and these measures are used by them to determine our compliance with certain covenants governing those debt instruments. Please read Note 8 Long-Term Debt under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for additional details regarding the covenants governing our debt instruments. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to Net income (loss) or Operating income (loss) or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. In evaluating our performance as measured by EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, management recognizes and considers the limitations of these measurements. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our liabilities for the payment of income taxes, interest expense or other obligations such as capital expenditures. Accordingly, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are only two of several measurements that management utilizes. Moreover, our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. .

Dollar Change (In millions) Three months ended September 30, 2023 reported gross profit 158.9 Cost of materials 56.0 LCM / LIFO inventory adjustments (8.5) Volumes 12.5 Operating costs 1.2 RINs expense (126.6) Sales price (91.2) Three months ended September 30, 2024 reported gross profit 2.3 The decrease in Specialty Products and Solutions segment gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to the impact of RINs prices. While RINs prices decreased in the current period in comparison to the prior year period, the mark-to-market impact of RINs prices resulted in a RINs expense of 30.8 million in the current period, as compared to a benefit of 95.8 million in the prior year period. The unfavorable impact associated with margins was reflective of product mix. The unfavorable impact resulting from the weakened commodity margin environment for fuels products was partially offset by higher margins for specialty products. These impacts were partially offset by the favorable volumes impact as a result of strong market demand. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our accounting for RINs. The components of the 101.7 million decrease in Montana/Renewables segment gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, were as follows:

While RINs prices decreased in the current period in comparison to the prior year period, the mark-to-market impact of RINs prices resulted in a RINs expense of 12.0 million in the current period, as compared to a benefit of 52.9 million in the prior year period. The unfavorable impact associated with margins was the result of feedstock price lag in Montana Renewables due to an abrupt drop in feedstock industry prices, as well as lower index margins during the current period. These impacts were partially offset by higher volumes as a result of improved operational performance at our Montana Renewables facility, which essentially operated at nameplate capacity in the current year period. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our accounting for RINs.

 Specialty Products and Solutions segment sales decreased period over period due to the lower commodity price environment in the current year period. This impact was partially offset by an increase in sales volumes as a result of strong market demand. The components of the 45.5 million increase in Montana/Renewables segment sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were as follows: 

Dollar Change (In millions) Sales price (144.5) Volume 190.0 Total Montana/Renewables segment sales increase 45.5 Montana/Renewables segment sales increased primarily due to stabilized production volumes at our Montana Renewables facility during the current year period in comparison to lower volumes in the prior year comparative period as a result of the start-up of the facility. This impact was partially offset by the weaker price environment in both our Montana Renewables and specialty asphalt businesses during the current year in comparison to the prior year period.

 Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased 282.4 million, or 65.7 , to 147.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 429.6 million in the same period in 2023. Gross profit for our business segments were as follows:

While RINs prices decreased in the current year period in comparison to the prior year period, the mark-to-market impact of RINs prices resulted in a RINs expense of 3.6 million in the current year period, as compared to a benefit of 95.7 million in the prior year period. The unfavorable impact associated with margins was the result of a weakened commodity margin environment for fuels products, coupled with the impact of lower margins for specialty products. The favorable volumes impact was the result of strong market demand. The favorable impact for operating costs in the current year period was due to the absence of expenses associated with turnarounds completed at our Shreveport, Cotton Valley, and Princeton facilities and unplanned outages as a result of the severe weather experienced in Northwest Louisiana during the prior year comparative period. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our accounting for RINs. The components of the 99.1 million decrease in Montana/Renewables segment gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were as follows:

While RINs prices decreased in the current year period in comparison to the prior year period, the mark-to-market impact of RINs prices resulted in a RINs benefit of 5.1 million in the current year period, as compared to a benefit of 61.3 million in the prior year period. This was coupled with the unfavorable impact resulting from a softer commodity margin environment in the current year period in comparison to the prior year. Operating expenses were unfavorable period over period as a result of operating the feedstock pre-treatment unit for the duration of the current year. The favorable volumes impact was the result of stabilized production at our Montana Renewables facility during the current year period. Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our accounting for RINs. The components of the 4.1 million increase in Performance Brands segment gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were as follows:

The unfavorable impact for operating costs was due to the partial receipt of proceeds from the Company s business interruption insurance policy included in the prior year period results. This segment continues to benefit from strong unit margins, reflective of stabilized input costs in our branded and consumer markets. Interest expense. Interest expense increased 11.6 million, or 7.1 , to 175.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 163.7 million in the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher borrowings on our revolving credit facility during the current year period in comparison to the prior year. Gain (loss) on derivative instruments. There was a 9.6 million gain on derivative instruments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 14.5 million loss in the same period in 2023. The 52.3 million unrealized gain on derivative instruments in the current year period was primarily related to the unrealized gain on the inventory financing embedded derivative. The 42.7 million realized loss on derivative instruments in the current year period was primarily due to the realized loss on the embedded derivative recognized at the termination of the Shreveport inventory financing arrangement with Macquarie. The 33.3 million realized loss on derivative instruments in the prior year period was due to the settlement of crack spread swaps positions during the period. The 18.8 million unrealized gain on derivative instruments in the prior year period was primarily the result of a 39.7 million unrealized gain on crack spread

 swaps positions, partially offset by the unrealized loss on the inventory financing embedded derivative of 20.9 million during the period. Liquidity and Capital Resources General The following should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources included under Part II, Item 7 in our 2023 Annual Report. There have been no material changes in that information other than as discussed below. Also, see Note 7 Inventory Financing Agreements and Note 8 Long-Term Debt under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for additional discussions related to our Supply and Offtake Agreements and our long-term debt. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities We believe that we have sufficient liquid assets, cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity and adequate access to capital markets to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. We continue to seek to lower our operating costs, selling expenses and general and administrative expenses as a means to further improve our cash flow from operations with the objective of having our cash flow from operations support all of our capital expenditures and interest payments. However, we are subject to business and operational risks that could materially adversely affect our cash flows. A material decrease in our cash flow from operations including a significant, sudden decrease in crude oil prices would likely produce a corollary effect on our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and potentially our ability to comply with the covenants under our revolving credit facility. A significant, sudden increase in crude oil prices, if sustained, would likely result in increased working capital requirements which would be funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In addition, our cash flow from operations may be impacted by the timing of settlement of our derivative activities. Gains and losses from derivative instruments that do not qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments until settlement and will impact operating cash flow in the period settled. The following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash in each of the periods presented: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In millions) Net cash used in operating activities (43.0) (7.4) Net cash used in investing activities (51.7) (240.3) Net cash provided by financing activities 122.3 232.9 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 27.6 (14.8) Operating Activities. Operating activities used cash of 43.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to using cash of 7.4 million during the same period in 2023. The change was primarily driven by a decrease in unit margins as a result of the weaker margin environment experienced during the current year period. This impact was partially offset by a decrease in the cash required for working capital during the current year period. Investing Activities. Investing activities used cash of 51.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a use of cash of 240.3 million during the same period in 2023. The change is related to a decrease in cash expenditures for additions to property, plant and equipment in the current year period in comparison to the prior year. The cash expenditures for additions to property, plant and equipment in the prior year period were primarily related to our Montana Renewables project. Financing Activities. Financing activities provided cash of 122.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to providing cash of 232.9 million during the same period in 2023. The change is primarily

 due to the borrowings we received in the prior year period from the issuance of the 2028 Notes and the MRL Term Loan Credit Agreement. This was partially offset by the proceeds we received in the current year from the issuance of the 2029 Notes, borrowings from the Montana terminal asset financing arrangement and the Montana refinery asset financing arrangement, and the increase in net borrowings on our revolving credit facility in the current year period compared to the same period in 2023. Capital Expenditures Our property, plant and equipment capital expenditure requirements consist of capital improvement expenditures, replacement capital expenditures, environmental capital expenditures and turnaround capital expenditures. Capital improvement expenditures include the acquisition of assets to grow our business, facility expansions, or capital initiatives that reduce operating costs. Replacement capital expenditures replace worn out or obsolete equipment or parts. Environmental capital expenditures include asset additions to meet or exceed environmental and operating regulations. Turnaround capital expenditures represent capitalized costs associated with our periodic major maintenance and repairs. The following table sets forth our capital improvement expenditures, replacement capital expenditures, environmental capital expenditures and turnaround capital expenditures in each of the periods shown (including capitalized interest): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In millions) Capital improvement expenditures 10.1 186.7 Replacement capital expenditures 38.3 44.6 Environmental capital expenditures 3.3 9.0 Turnaround capital expenditures 17.9 28.9 Total 69.6 269.2 2024 Capital Spending Forecast We are forecasting total capital expenditures of approximately 110 million to 140 million in 2024. Our forecasted capital expenditures are primarily related to growth and sustainability projects. We anticipate that capital expenditure requirements will be provided primarily through cash flow from operations, cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and by accessing capital markets as necessary. Further, we continue to anticipate that capital improvement expenditure requirements will be funded from borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or by funding accessed through capital markets. If future capital expenditures require expenditures in excess of our then-current cash flow from operations and borrowing availability under our revolving credit facilities, we may be required to issue debt or equity securities in public or private offerings or incur additional borrowings under bank credit facilities to meet those costs. Debt and Credit Facilities As of September 30, 2024, our primary debt and credit instruments consisted of the following: 650.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in January 2027 (after giving effect to the amendments to our revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility Amendments )), subject to borrowing base limitations, with a maximum letter of credit sub-limit equal to 255.0 million, which amount may be increased to 90 of revolver commitments in effect with the consent of the Agent (as defined in the Credit Agreement) revolving credit facility 90.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, with the option to request additional commitments of up to 15.0 million, maturing in November 2027 (the MRL Revolving Credit Agreement 363.5 million of 11.00 Senior Notes due 2025 2025 Notes 325.0 million of 8.125 Senior Notes due 2027 2027 Notes

For additional information regarding our revolving credit facilities, see Note 8 Long-Term Debt under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report. Long-Term Financing In addition to our principal sources of short-term liquidity listed above, subject to market conditions, we may meet our cash requirements through the issuance of long-term notes or additional common shares. From time to time, we issue long-term debt securities referred to as our senior notes. Our outstanding senior notes are unsecured obligations that rank equally with all of our other senior debt obligations to the extent they are unsecured. As of September 30, 2024, we had 363.5 million in 2025 Notes, 325.0 million in 2027 Notes, 325.0 million in 2028 Notes, and 200.0 million in 2029 Secured Notes outstanding.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices, the price of credits needed to comply with governmental programs, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about material market risk is set forth below. Commodity Price Risk Derivative Instruments We are exposed to price risks due to fluctuations in the price of crude oil, refined products, natural gas and precious metals. We use various strategies to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk. We do not attempt to eliminate all of our risk as the costs of such actions are believed to be too high in relation to the risk posed to our future cash flows, earnings and liquidity. The strategies we use to reduce our risk utilize both physical forward contracts and financially settled derivative instruments, such as swaps, collars, options and futures, to attempt to reduce our exposure with respect to: crude oil purchases and sales; refined product sales and purchases; natural gas purchases; precious metals; and fluctuations in the value of crude oil between geographic regions and between the different types of crude oil such as NYMEX WTI, Light Louisiana Sweet, WCS, WTI Midland, Mixed Sweet Blend, Magellan East Houston and ICE Brent. 
 We manage our exposure to commodity markets, credit, volumetric and liquidity risks to manage our costs and volatility of cash flows as conditions warrant or opportunities become available. These risks may be managed in a variety of ways that may include the use of derivative instruments. Derivative instruments may be used for the purpose of mitigating risks associated with an asset, liability and anticipated future transactions and the changes in fair value of our derivative instruments will affect our earnings and cash flows; however, such changes should be offset by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction that is part of the risk management strategy. We do not speculate with derivative instruments or other contractual arrangements that are not associated with our business objectives. Speculation is defined as increasing our natural position above the maximum position of our physical assets or trading in commodities, currencies or other risk bearing assets that are not associated with our business activities and objectives. Our positions are monitored routinely by a risk management committee and discussed with the board of directors of the Company quarterly to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy and documented risk management strategies. All strategies are reviewed on an ongoing basis by our risk management committee, which will add, remove or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and/or in risk profiles. These changes in strategies are to position us in relation to our risk exposures in an attempt to capture market opportunities as they arise. Please read Note 9 Derivatives in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the accounting treatment for the various types of derivative instruments, for a further discussion of our hedging policies and for more information relating to our implied crack spreads of crude oil, diesel, and gasoline derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments and overall hedging positions are monitored regularly by our risk management committee, which includes executive officers. The risk management committee reviews market information and our hedging positions regularly to determine if additional derivatives activity is advised. A summary of derivative positions and a summary of hedging strategy are presented to our Board of Directors quarterly.

 Compliance Price Risk Renewable Identification Numbers We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with governmental programs. The EPA sets annual volume obligations for the percentage of renewable fuels that must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the U.S., and as a producer of transportation fuels from petroleum, we are subject to those obligations. To the extent we are unable to physically blend renewable fuels to satisfy the EPA requirement, we may purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy the annual obligations. We have not entered into any derivative instruments to manage this risk. Holding other variables related to RINs obligations constant, a 1.00 increase in the price of RINs would be expected to have a negative impact on Net income (loss) of approximately 65.0 million per year. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate changes on fixed and variable rate debt is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. The following table provides information about the fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt obligations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which we disclose in Note 8 Long-Term Debt and Note 10 Fair Value Measurements under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

We had a 650.0 million revolving credit facility and a 90.0 million revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024, with borrowings for each revolving credit facility bearing interest at the prime rate or SOFR, at our option, plus the applicable margin. In addition, we had 73.9 million of borrowings outstanding under our MRL Term Loan Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024, with borrowings bearing interest at SOFR plus 6.0 to 7.3 per annum. We had 225.9 million of outstanding variable rate debt as of September 30, 2024 and 149.7 million of outstanding variable rate debt as of December 31, 2023. Holding other variables constant (such as debt levels), a 100 basis point change in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of September 30, 2024, would be expected to have an impact on Net income (loss) of approximately 2.3 million per year. Foreign Currency Risk We have minimal exposure to foreign currency risk and as such the cost of hedging this risk is viewed to be in excess of the benefit of further reductions in our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

(g) THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT IS DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, AND THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SUCH DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE AND THAT THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT IS INTENDED TO BE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOT A PENALTY.

Aron shall be under no obligation to prioritize the order with respect to which it exercises any one or more rights and remedies available hereunder. The Transaction Parties shall in all events remain jointly and severally liable to Aron for any amount payable by the Transaction Parties in respect of any of their obligations remaining unpaid after any such liquidation, application and set off.

 (k) No delay or failure on the part of the Non-Defaulting Party in exercising any right or remedy to which it may be entitled on account of any Event of Default or Aron EoD shall constitute an abandonment of any such right, and the Non-Defaulting Party shall be entitled to exercise such right or remedy at any time during the continuance of an Event of Default or Aron EoD, as applicable.

85

 (b) The Parties acknowledge that one or more of the components of the Termination Amount may not be able to be definitively determined by the Termination Date and therefore agree that Aron shall, estimate, in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, each of such components and use such estimated components to determine an estimate of the Termination Amount (the Estimated Termination Amount ). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties agree that the amount due under Section 17.2(a)(i) above shall be estimated by Aron in the same manner and using the same methodology as it used in preparing the Estimated Commencement Date Value, but in each case, applying the Estimated Step-Out Index Amount and the applicable Prices for such Feedstock and Products (without giving effect to any Inventory Advance Rate, any Fixed Holdback Amount and any Incremental Holdback Amount) and other price terms provided for herein with respect to the purchase of the Termination Date Volumes or the calculation of other amounts that may be owed by the Transaction Parties hereunder. Aron shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare, and provide the Company with, an initial Estimated Termination Amount, together with appropriate supporting documentation, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Termination Date. To the extent reasonably practicable, Aron shall endeavor to update its calculation of the Estimated Termination Amount by no later than 4:00 p.m. ET on the Business Day prior to the Termination Date. Otherwise, the initial Estimated Termination Amount shall be the amount payable on the Termination Date. If the Estimated Termination Amount is a positive number, it shall be due to Aron and if it is a negative number, the absolute value thereof shall be due to the Company.
 (c) On or before the later of fifteen (15) Business Days following the (i) Termination Date and (ii) the receipt by Aron from the Transaction Parties of the Termination Date Volumes, any applicable monthly reports or statements and any other information reasonably requested by Aron, Aron shall prepare, and provide the Company with, (y) a statement showing the calculation, as of the Termination Date, of the Termination Amount, and 
 (z) a statement (the Termination Reconciliation Statement reconciling the Termination Amount with the sum of the Estimated Termination Amount pursuant to Section 17.2(b) and indicating any amount remaining to be paid by one Party to the other as a result of such reconciliation. Within one (1) Business Day after receiving the Termination Reconciliation Statement and the related supporting documentation, the Parties will make any and all payments required pursuant thereto. Promptly after receiving (or making) such payments (but in any event within five (5) Business Days), Aron shall (i) cause any filing or recording of any UCC financing forms to be terminated, (ii) release and terminate all Lien Documents pursuant to one or more instruments mutually acceptable to the Parties and (iii) deliver, re-assign, reconvey and transfer, as applicable, to the Transaction Parties any other Collateral or credit support held or maintained by Aron. 
 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Aron shall not have any obligation to make any payment contemplated by this Section 17.2 , transfer title to Feedstock or Products, release liens or otherwise cooperate in the transition matters described in Section 17.1 unless the Transaction Parties shall have performed their obligations under the Step-Out

If the Equipment is unsatisfactory for any reason, Lessee shall make any claim solely against the manufacturer, supplier or vendor thereof and shall, nevertheless, pay Lessor all Rent payable hereunder. 5. SELECTION AND USE OF EQUIPMENT. Lessee agrees that it shall be responsible for the selection, use of, and results obtained from, the Equipment and any other associated assets or services. Lessee agrees that the Equipment will be operated solely in the continental United States unless the applicable Schedule provides otherwise and by competent, qualified personnel in connection with Lessee s business for the purpose for which the Equipment was designed and in accordance with applicable operating instructions, insurance policies, laws and government regulations except for such variances therefrom as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined) on Lessee and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole), or the Equipment. Lessee shall not discontinue use of the Equipment for more than one hundred eighty (180) days, except for such discontinuance of use of any particular Equipment as (a) would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Lessee and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole), or the Equipment (taken as a whole), or (b) results from (i) a plant turnaround, or (ii) (A) a casualty event that is not a casualty event with respect to the Equipment, that occurs in a part of the facility in which the Equipment is located, or (B) a crude oil or input supply, pandemic related, or other business interruption caused by an external event outside the control of Lessee, and which in the case of (A) or (B) impacts for the duration of any such event the product lines for which the Equipment is used,

resulting in idling of such Equipment; provided that , the foregoing exceptions shall not be construed so as to permit Lessee to utilize other equipment or property not constituting Equipment in lieu of the idled Equipment. Lessee shall procure and maintain in effect all orders, licenses, certificates, permits, approvals and consents required by federal, state or local laws or by any governmental body, agency or authority in connection with the delivery, installation, possession, use, maintenance and operation of the Equipment except where the failure to procure or maintain any of the foregoing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Lessee and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole), or the Equipment. Lessee shall not move any Equipment from the location specified for it in the applicable Schedule, provided, however, Lessee may move Equipment to another location within the United States provided that Lessee has delivered to Lessor (i) prior written notice thereof and (ii) duly executed agreements and instruments (all in form and substance satisfactory to Lessor) necessary or, in the opinion of Lessor, desirable to protect Lessor s interest in such Equipment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately preceding sentence, Lessee may keep any Equipment consisting of motor vehicles or rolling stock at any location in the continental United States. Lessee and Lessor agree that each Lease is a finance lease as defined by Section 2A-103(g) of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York (the UCC ). Lessee acknowledges: (i) that Lessee is or has selected the Supplier as defined in Article 2A of the UCC and (ii) that Lessee was informed, before Lessee s execution of this Lease and is hereby informed in writing that Lessee is entitled under Article 2A of the UCC to the promises and warranties, including those of any third party, provided to Lessor by the Supplier in connection with or as part of the Equipment purchase, and that Lessee may communicate with the Supplier and receive an accurate and complete statement of those promises and warranties, including any disclaimers and limitations on remedies relating thereto. Lessee acknowledges and agrees that neither the manufacturer or supplier, nor any salesman, representative or other agent of the manufacturer or supplier, is an agent of Lessor. No salesman, representative or agent of the manufacturer or supplier is authorized to waive or alter any term or condition of this Agreement or any Schedule and no representation as to the Equipment or any other matter by the manufacturer or supplier shall in any way affect Lessee s duty to pay Rent and perform its other obligations as set forth in this Agreement or any Schedule. For purposes hereof, Material Adverse Effect means (a) a material adverse change in, or a material adverse effect upon, the operations, business, properties, liabilities (actual or contingent) or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Lessee and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; (b) a material impairment of the ability of Lessee to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the Lease; (c) a material adverse effect upon the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability against any Lessee of this Agreement, (d) a material impairment of the ability of the Guarantor to perform its obligations under a guaranty of the Lessee s obligations under any Lease or (e) a material adverse effect upon the condition or value of the Equipment taken as a whole. 6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. Lessee acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Equipment is of a size, design and capacity selected by Lessee, (ii) Lessor is neither a manufacturer nor a vendor of such Equipment and Lessor did not select the Equipment, (iii) LESSOR LEASES AND LESSEE TAKES THE PROPERTY AND EACH PART THEREOF AS-IS AND THAT LESSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR COVENANT, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE CONDITION, QUALITY, DURABILITY, VALUE, DESIGN, OPERATION, SUITABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE IN ANY RESPECT WHATSOEVER OR AS TO THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE, OR AS TO THE ABSENCE OF ANY INFRINGEMENT OR ANY PATENT, TRADEMARK OR COPYRIGHT, OR AS TO ANY OBLIGATION BASED ON STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR COVENANT OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED WITH RESPECT THERETO, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY SUCH WARRANTY. LESSEE SPECIFICALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO MAKE A CLAIM AGAINST LESSOR FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER. IN NO EVENT SHALL LESSOR HAVE ANY OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY FOR, NOR SHALL LESSEE HAVE ANY REMEDY AGAINST LESSOR FOR ANY ACTUAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR OTHER CLAIM, LOSS, DAMAGE OR EXPENSE CAUSED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY THE PROPERTY OR ANY DEFICIENCY OR DEFECT THEREOF OR THE INSTALLATION, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE OR REPAIR THEREOF OR THERETO. Lessee may have rights under the contract evidencing Lessor s purchase of any of the Equipment from the contractor, manufacturer or vendor. Lessee is advised to contact such contractor, manufacturer or vendor of the Equipment for a description of any such rights. Lessor hereby assigns to Lessee during the term of any Lease, for the sole purpose of prosecuting a claim, the benefits of any and all warranties, if any, expressed or implied with respect to the Equipment, running from the contractor, manufacturer or the vendor of the Equipment to Lessor or its assigns, to the extent assignable. Lessor and Lessee shall cooperate in good faith regarding any claim under any such warranty. Lessee, by its execution of each Schedule, acknowledges that it has received a copy of the contractor s or manufacturer s warranties for the applicable Equipment. Lessee s sole remedy for the breach of any such contractor s or manufacturer s warranty shall be against the contractor or manufacturer of the Equipment, and not against Lessor or its assigns. Lessee expressly acknowledges that Lessor makes, and has made, no representations or warranties whatsoever as to the existence or the availability of such warranties of the manufacturer of the Equipment. 7. OWNERSHIP; MARKING; FINANCING STATEMENTS; NO LIENS. The Equipment is and shall be the sole property of Lessor and, except as set forth in the applicable Schedule, the parties agree that the Equipment shall at all times remain personal property and not a fixture and that Lessor s title thereto shall not be impaired, notwithstanding the manner in which it may be affixed to any real property. Lessee shall affix to the Equipment any labels supplied by Lessor indicating ownership of such Equipment and shall promptly replace any such markings or identification which are removed, defaced or destroyed. Lessee shall obtain and record such instruments and take such steps as Lessor may reasonably request to prevent any person or entity from acquiring any rights in the Equipment by reason of the Equipment being claimed or deemed to be real property. It is the express intention of the parties hereto that (i) each Lease constitutes a true lease as such term is defined in Article 2A of the UCC and not a sale or retention of security interest; and (ii) title to the Equipment shall at all times remain in Lessor, and Lessee shall acquire no ownership, property, rights, equity or interest other than a leasehold interest, solely as Lessee subject to the terms and conditions of the respective Lease, including Lessee s right to purchase the Equipment thereunder. If, notwithstanding the express intent of the parties, a court 
 Master Lease (Calumet Montana Refining, LLC) Page 2 VP/#68122827.3 

of competent jurisdiction determines that any Schedule is not a true lease, but rather is a sale and extension of credit, a lease intended for security, a loan secured by the Equipment specified in such Schedule, or other similar arrangement, the parties agree that in such event: (A) in order to secure the prompt payment and performance as and when due of all of Lessee s obligations (both now existing and hereafter arising) under each such Schedule, Lessee shall be deemed to have granted and it hereby grants to Lessor, a first priority security interest in the following (whether now existing or hereafter created): the Equipment described in such Schedule and all cash and non-cash proceeds, including the proceeds of all insurance policies (regardless of whether the Equipment is characterized under the UCC as Lessee s equipment or inventory and the security deposit, if any; and (B) Lessee agrees that with respect to the Equipment and security deposit, in addition to all of the other rights and remedies available to Lessor hereunder upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lessor shall have all of the rights and remedies of a first priority secured party under the UCC. Lessee may not dispose of any of the Equipment except to the extent expressly provided herein, notwithstanding the fact that proceeds constitute a part of the Equipment. Lessee hereby authorizes Lessor to file a financing statement and amendments thereto describing the Equipment described in any and all Schedules now and hereafter executed pursuant hereto and adding any other collateral described therein and containing any other information required by the applicable Uniform Commercial Code. Lessee shall execute and deliver to Lessor for filing any similar documents Lessor may request, including any applicable fixture filings Lessor may deem appropriate in light of the nature of the Equipment. Upon request by Lessor, Lessee shall obtain and deliver to Lessor valid and effective waivers, in recordable form, by the owners, landlords and mortgagees of the real property upon which the Equipment is located or certificates of Lessee that it is the owner of such real property. Furthermore, Lessee agrees to maintain the Equipment free from all claims, liens, attachments, rights of others or encumbrances of any nature or kind whatsoever, including legal processes Liens of creditors of Lessee or any other persons or entities, other than (i) Liens for fees, taxes, levies, duties or other governmental charges of any kind, Liens of mechanics, materialmen, laborers, employees, suppliers, taxing authorities and similar Liens not yet overdue for a period of more than thirty (30) days or that are being contested in good faith by negotiations or by appropriate proceedings which suspend the collection thereof; provided , however , that such proceedings do not involve any substantial risk (as determined in Lessor s sole discretion) of the sale, forfeiture or loss of the Equipment or any interest therein), (ii) Liens securing purchase money indebtedness incurred to finance the improvement or replacement of Severable Improvements, provided that (1) the amount of such indebtedness when incurred shall not exceed the purchase price of such improvement and (2) such Lien shall not encumber Equipment other than the Severable Improvement and insurance proceeds thereof, (iii) easements, rights-of-way, restrictions (including zoning limitations) and other similar encumbrances affecting real property which, in the aggregate, do not materially interfere with the use of the Equipment in the ordinary course of business or Lessor s access to and repossession of the Equipment upon termination or expiration of any Lease, and (iv) with respect to the real property on which the Equipment is located, or with respect to sublease of any storage tanks, any Liens expressly set forth as permitted Liens in the applicable Schedule. Lessee will defend, at its own expense, Lessor s title to the Equipment from such claims, Liens or legal processes. Lessee shall also notify Lessor promptly upon receipt of written notice of any Lien on the Equipment. In the event Lessee receives or otherwise comes into possession of any manufacturer s statement of origin, any certificate of title or any other document evidencing ownership issued with respect to any Equipment, Lessee will promptly (but in no event later than three (3) business days) after its receipt thereof deliver the same directly to Lessor, in each case with any necessary endorsements in favor of Lessor. Notwithstanding the terms of this Agreement, the following constitute permitted dispositions (that are not prohibited hereby) of the Equipment: (i) any disposition that might be deemed to occur as a result of the damage to or theft, loss or destruction of all or any part of the Equipment; provided , however , that Lessee has fully performed its obligations set forth in Section 8 , Section 10 and any applicable obligations set forth in the Lease with respect to Stipulated Loss Values, (ii) any disposition arising from maintenance of the Equipment, so long as the parts of the Equipment that are replaced pursuant to such maintenance continue to constitute a part of the Equipment, (iii) any subassemblies or subparts of the Equipment that are sent out for repair and promptly returned for reassembly with the Equipment shall not be deemed to have been disposed of, and (iv) the sublease of any storage tanks constituting a part of the Equipment in connection with the performance of one or more supply and offtake or inventory financing arrangements, provided that Lessee s supply and offtake or inventory financing counterparty and Lessor are party to intercreditor arrangements satisfactory to Lessor in Lessor s reasonable discretion. 8. MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT . Lessee, at its sole cost and expense, shall maintain, service and repair the Equipment: (i) in accordance and consistent with (A) the manufacturer s or supplier s recommendations and all maintenance and operating manuals or service agreements, whenever furnished or entered into, including any subsequent amendments or replacements thereof, issued by the manufacturer, supplier or service provider, (B) the requirements of all applicable insurance policies, (C) the purchase agreement or supply contract, if any, so as to preserve all of Lessee s and Lessor s rights thereunder, including all rights to any warranties, indemnities or other rights or remedies, (D) all applicable laws, except where the failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Lessee or the Equipment, and (E) the prudent practice of other similar companies in the same business as Lessee, but in any event, to no lesser standard than that employed by Lessee for comparable property owned or leased by it; and (ii) without limiting the foregoing, so as to cause the Equipment to be in good repair, condition and working order in full compliance with the terms hereof, ordinary wear and tear excepted. All replacement parts shall be free and clear of all liens, encumbrances or rights of others and have a value, utility and remaining useful life at least equal to the parts replaced. Title to all such parts, improvements and additions to the Equipment immediately shall vest in Lessor, without cost or expense to Lessor or any further action by any other person or entity, and such parts, improvements and additions shall be deemed incorporated in the Equipment and subject to the terms of the Lease as if originally leased hereunder. Lessee shall make the Equipment and its maintenance records available for inspection by Lessor at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance written notice; provided , however , that inspection is a visual act only, and inspection does not include construction, deconstruction, cutting, welding or other physical alteration of the Equipment. 9. ALTERATION; MODIFICATIONS; PARTS. Lessee may not materially alter or modify the Equipment without the prior written consent of Lessor, such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld; provided , however , that Lessee shall have the right at any time and from time to time during the Term to make improvements to the Equipment, or any portion thereof, in connection with the 
 Master Lease (Calumet Montana Refining, LLC) Page 3 VP/#68122827.3 

requirements of Lessee s business (each, an Improvement ), without the prior consent of Lessor, so long as such Improvement (i) does not diminish the then fair market value or the utility of the Equipment and (ii) is performed in a good and workmanlike manner. At least once per calendar quarter or upon written request by Lessor, to the extent any Improvement during the preceding three months involved an item of the Equipment identified by a serial number in the relevant Schedule, Lessee will notify Lessor of such Improvement and, if applicable, will provide the new serial number for such item of the Equipment. Any Improvement, other than a Severable Improvement shall be a part of the Equipment, subject to this Agreement, and shall revert to Lessor at the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, with no obligation on the part of Lessor to reimburse Lessee or any other person or entity for it. Any part installed in connection with warranty or maintenance service or which cannot be removed in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be the property of Lessor, with no obligation on the part of Lessor to reimburse Lessee or any other person or entity for it. 10. LOSS OR DAMAGE; STIPULATED LOSS VALUE. Until the Equipment is returned to and received by Lessor as provided in Section 14 hereof, Lessee shall bear the entire risk of loss or destruction or damage to the Equipment Casualty Loss ). No Casualty Loss shall relieve Lessee from its obligations to pay Rent except as expressly provided in this section. When any Casualty Loss occurs, Lessee shall notify Lessor as promptly as possible under the circumstances and, at the option of Lessee and at Lessee s sole cost and expense, promptly place such Equipment in good repair and working order in the condition required by this Agreement. If an item of Equipment is subject to a Total Loss (as hereinafter defined) as opposed to damage that may be repaired and is economically reasonable to repair, Lessee shall have the option, as hereinafter provided, either to replace each such item of Equipment with similar new or used Equipment, and upon any replacement, the Lessor shall be deemed to relinquish title to such Equipment and to receive title to the replacement Equipment (the Replacement Equipment ), or to pay Stipulated Loss Value and make related payments, as hereinafter provided. The Replacement Equipment shall have at least the value, expected residual value, function and remaining useful life, as such Equipment that suffered the Casualty Loss, assuming that such Equipment had been maintained in accordance with the maintenance provisions of the applicable Lease and it shall not result in such Equipment becoming limited use property within the meaning of Rev. Proc. 2001-28, 2001-19 C.B. 1156 or Rev. Proc. 2001-29, 2001-19 C.B. 1160 (or any successors thereto). Provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lessor of work performed or to be performed, the order of replacement goods, progress payments due for work in progress (or for work to be completed in phases), documented deposit requirements for work to be performed (including deposits required in advance of the commencement of work or the fabrication of replacement goods), images of completed work, or other similar evidence from Lessee or the vendor providing the repairs, Lessor will apply any net insurance proceeds received by Lessor on account of such loss to the cost of repairs or replacement and release such amount (if in Lessor s custody) for payment to the vendor providing the repair or replacement for the Equipment or, if Lessee so requests, disburse to Lessee the applicable amount for payment by Lessee to such vendor. Upon the occurrence of the loss, disappearance, theft, damage or destruction of any item of the Equipment, or the condemnation, confiscation, requisition, seizure, forfeiture or other taking of title to or use of any item of the Equipment or the imposition of any Lien thereon by any governmental authority (any of the foregoing occurrences being herein referred to as a Total Loss ), Lessee shall have the option (evidenced by written notice from Lessee to Lessor within forty-five (45) days after the Total Loss) either (i) on the next date for the payment of Rent, pay to Lessor the Rent due on that date plus the Stipulated Loss Value (set forth in applicable Schedule) of the item or items of the Equipment with respect to which the Total Loss has occurred and any other sums due hereunder with respect to that Equipment (less any insurance proceeds or condemnation award actually paid and received by Lessor), and if such insurance proceeds exceed the Stipulated Loss Value, then such excess shall be paid to Lessee, or (ii) to replace such item or items of Equipment, such replacement to be effected as promptly as practicable (and Lessee shall continue to pay rent while awaiting any such replacement Equipment from the vendor thereof, while Lessor shall hold any insurance proceeds with respect to Equipment that is a Total Loss as collateral for Lessee s obligations hereunder, pending the use of such insurance proceeds for the replacement cost of such Equipment in accordance with the terms hereof). Upon Lessee s election to make and the making of such payment, the Lease and the obligation to make future rental payments shall terminate solely with respect to the Equipment or items thereof so paid for and (to the extent applicable) Lessee shall become entitled thereto AS IS WHERE IS without warranty, express or implied, with respect to any matter whatsoever, except for the absence of any Liens of Lessor. Stipulated Loss Value shall be determined as of the next date on which a payment of Rent is or would be due after a Total Loss, after payment of any Rent due on such date, and the applicable Stipulated Loss Value shall be that which is set forth with respect to such Rent payment date. If Lessee fails to perform its obligations under this Section 10 , Lessor shall have the right to substitute performance, in which case, Lessee shall immediately upon demand, reimburse Lessor therefor. 11. INSURANCE. Lessee shall cause to be obtained and maintained at all times (including, without limitation, any period of storage) on the Equipment, at its own expense, all risk physical damage insurance and comprehensive general and/or automobile (as appropriate) liability insurance (covering bodily injury and property damage exposure including, without limitation, contractual liability and products liability) in such amounts, against such risks, in such form and with such insurers as is customary for similarly situated operators of assets such as the Equipment; provided , however , that the amount of all-risk physical damage insurance shall not be less than the greater of (i) the replacement value of the Equipment; or (ii) the Stipulated Loss Value of the Equipment specified in the applicable Schedule. Each physical damage insurance policy will name Lessor (together with its successors and assigns) as loss payee. Each liability insurance policy shall provide coverage (including contractual, cross-liability and personal injury coverage) of not less than 50,000,000 or the amount required by law, whichever is greater for each occurrence, name Lessor (together with its affiliates and each of its and their successors and assigns) as an additional insured, and be primary as respects of any other insurance. Each insurance policy shall provide, by endorsement or otherwise that the interests of Lessor shall not be invalidated by any action or inaction of Lessee or any other person or entity, and shall insure Lessor regardless of any breach or violation by Lessee or any other person or entity, of any warranties, declarations or conditions of such policies. All policies shall contain a clause requiring the insurer to give Lessor at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of any material change in the terms or cancellation of the policy and shall include a waiver of subrogation as respects Lessor s insurance policies. Lessee shall be liable for all deductible portions of all required insurance. Lessee shall furnish a certificate of insurance providing confirmation of these insurance policies and, at Lessor s request, Lessee shall provide a copy of each insurance policy (with endorsements); provided , however , Lessor shall have no duty to ascertain the existence of or to examine the insurance policies to advise Lessee if the insurance coverage does not comply with the requirements of this Section. If Lessee fails to insure the Equipment as required, Lessor shall have the right but not the obligation to obtain such insurance, and the cost of the insurance shall be for the account of Lessee due as part of the next due Rent. Lessee consents to Lessor s 
 Master Lease (Calumet Montana Refining, LLC) Page 4 VP/#68122827.3 

release, upon its failure to obtain appropriate insurance coverage, of any and all information necessary to obtain insurance with respect to the Equipment or Lessor s interest therein. Lessee hereby appoints Lessor as Lessee s attorney-in-fact to (i) for so long as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii) regardless of whether an Event of Default is then continuing, if the insurer of any Casualty Loss fails to comply with any loss payee clause, in each case (i) and (ii), Lessor shall have the authority, in the name and on behalf of Lessee, to make claim for, receive payment of, and execute and endorse all documents, checks or drafts issued with respect to any Casualty Loss under any insurance policy relating to the Equipment. 12. TAXES. Lessee will pay all personal property taxes, fees, levies, imposts, duties, withholdings and governmental charges on the Equipment, including all sales, use, excise, goods and services, and other taxes and fees. Lessee shall, to the extent permitted by law, cause all billings of such taxes, fees, levies, imposts, duties, withholdings and governmental charges to be made to Lessee. Lessee shall indemnify and hold Lessor harmless from, all charges, fees, assessments and sales, use, excise and other taxes (including, without limitation, income, franchise, business and occupation, gross receipts, sales, use, licensing, registration, titling, commercial activity, personal property, stamp and interest equalization taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges or withholdings of any nature), and any fines, penalties or interest thereon, imposed or levied by any governmental body, agency or tax authority upon or in connection with the Equipment, its purchase, ownership, delivery, leasing, possession, use or relocation of the Equipment or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by each Lease or the Rent thereunder, but excluding taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges or withholdings of any nature (including any related interest and penalties) on or measured by, or imposed with respect to, (i) the Lessor s net or gross income, net or gross receipts, alternative minimum taxable income, items of tax preference, branch profits, franchise, capital, conduct of business, stock value or net worth or other status of Lessor (in each case other than taxes that are (or are in the nature of) sales, use, value added, transfer, excise and personal property taxes), (ii) resulting from Lessor s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or the material breach by Lessor of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations in this Agreement or the Lease, (iii) resulting from or arising out of any failure on the part of Lessor to file any tax returns or pay any taxes owing on a timely basis or any errors or omissions on Lessor s tax returns unless, in each case, Lessee is responsible under the Lease for filing the returns pursuant to this Agreement or the Lease, (iv) attributable to a transfer or disposition (directly or indirectly) of any interest in the Equipment, the Lease or any part of the foregoing or any interest in Lessor (including a deemed transfer for tax purposes) other than (A) a transfer to Lessee pursuant to the exercise of any purchase option granted to Lessee under the Lease, or (B) a transfer pursuant to Lessor s exercise of remedies in Section 21 of this Agreement as a result of an Event of Default, (v) resulting from the leasing, ownership, use or operation of the Equipment after Lessee s return of the Equipment in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Lease, except as a result of an Event of Default, (vi) imposed on Lessor (including by way of withholding) as a result of the failure by Lessor (or any member of Lessor) to be a United States person (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ), (vii) imposed on Lessor by any jurisdiction to the extent such taxes would not have been imposed on Lessor had Lessor not engaged in activities in such jurisdiction unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Lease, and (viii) imposed on any transferee, assignee or successor in interest of Lessor to the extent such taxes are in excess of the taxes that would have been imposed on Lessor had such transfer or assignment not occurred. Lessee shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, prepare and file all property tax reports, renditions, tax returns and information statements which are required to be made with respect to any item of Equipment leased hereunder. For that purpose, Lessor hereby appoints Lessee its agent and attorney-in-fact and Lessee shall be responsible for making filings and payments on behalf of Lessor where the incidence thereof falls on Lessor (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, federal or state income tax returns). Lessor will cooperate with Lessee by timely providing information requested by Lessee in connection with Lessee s preparation and filing of such reports, renditions, returns or information statements. Lessor further agrees to promptly forward to Lessee any assessments, tax bills or other correspondence received in connection therewith. Upon request, Lessee will furnish to Lessor proof of payment of all taxes and other imposts described above. Lessee shall be entitled to contest the imposition of taxes, charges and fees (including penalties) subject to this Section 12 at Lessee s sole cost and expense; provided that Lessee has confirmed in writing its liability for the amounts should it lose the contest, the contest does not create a material risk of sale, loss or forfeiture of the Equipment or otherwise create a material adverse impact on Lessor s interest in the Equipment (as determined in Lessor s sole good faith discretion), and Lessee keeps Lessor reasonably informed about the progress of the contest and provides Lessor copies of any filings or correspondence with the tax authorities about the case. Lessor shall provide to Lessee such information as Lessee may reasonably request in order to contest the applicable tax and shall otherwise cooperate with Lessee to the extent necessary to permit Lessee to conduct such contest. Lessor agrees not to settle any claim that Lessee is contesting in accordance with this Section 12 without the prior written consent of Lessee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If Lessor shall obtain a refund, credit or other tax benefit attributable to an amount paid by Lessee pursuant to this Section 12 , Lessor shall promptly pay or credit to Lessee the amount of such refund, credit or tax benefit (net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such refund, credit or tax benefit); provided that Lessee shall repay such amount to Lessor in the event Lessor is required to repay such refund, or is subsequently denied such credit or tax benefit, upon receipt of documentation from Lessor substantiating the loss of such refund, credit or tax benefit. For the avoidance of doubt, Lessor acknowledges and agrees that Lessee shall be entitled to claim, for federal and state tax purposes, all tax attributes and benefits, including depreciation deductions, attributable to any Improvements, including without limitation all Severable Improvements. 13. PURCHASE RENEWAL OPTIONS. So long as no Event of Default constituting a rent payment default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee may: (a) upon written notice to Lessor received at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the Term Expiration Date for the applicable Lease, purchase all, but not less than all, of the Equipment covered by the applicable Lease on such Term Expiration Date. The purchase price for such Equipment (the Purchase Price ), shall be its fair market value on an in-place, in-use basis, as mutually agreed by Lessor and Lessee, or, if they cannot agree after exchanging written statements of the estimated fair market value, then as determined in the following manner:

If Lessee has elected to exercise its purchase option, then on the Term Expiration Date for any Equipment, Lessee shall pay to Lessor the Purchase Price, together with all sales and other similar taxes applicable to the transfer of the Equipment and any other amount payable and arising hereunder, in immediately available funds, whereupon Lessor shall transfer to Lessee, without recourse or warranty of any kind, express or implied, all of Lessor s right, title and interest in and to such Equipment on an as is, where is basis, except Lessor will warrant that the Equipment is free and clear of any liens created by Lessor or any party on Lessor s behalf; or (b) upon written notice to Lessor received at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the Term Expiration Date for the applicable Lease, extend the Term of the applicable Lease for all, but not less than all, of the Equipment covered by such Lease for an additional period of not less than 24 months, during which the monthly Rental Payment Amount (as such term is used in the applicable Schedule) will remain the same Rental Payment Amount as initially set forth in the applicable Schedule.

If none of the foregoing options are exercised by Lessee, then Section 14 shall apply. 14. RETURN OF EQUIPMENT; HOLDOVER. Except for Equipment that has suffered a Total Loss and is not required to be repaired pursuant to Section 10 hereof or Equipment which has been purchased by Lessee pursuant to Section 13 hereof, upon expiration or termination of the Term of a Lease, or upon demand by Lessor pursuant to Section 20 below, Lessee shall contact Lessor for shipping instructions and, at Lessee s own risk, immediately return the Equipment, freight, Equipment loading, unloading and rigging costs prepaid, to a location in the continental United States specified by Lessor. At the time of such return to Lessor, the Equipment shall (i) be in the operating order, repair and condition as required by Section 8 hereof and (ii) be capable of being immediately assembled and operated by a third party purchaser or third party lessee without further repair, replacement, alterations or improvements, and in accordance and compliance with any and all statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of any governmental authority or any political subdivision thereof applicable to the use and operation of the Equipment. Except as otherwise provided under Section 13 hereof, at least one hundred eighty (180) days (but not more than two hundred seventy (270) days) before the expiration of any Term, Lessee shall give Lessor written notice of its intent to return the Equipment at the end of such Term Return Notice ). During such one hundred eighty (180) day period, Lessor and its prospective purchasers or lessees shall have the right of access to the premises on which the Equipment is located to inspect the Equipment, and Lessee shall cooperate in all other respects with Lessor s remarketing of the Equipment. The provisions of this Section 14 are of the essence of the Lease, and upon application to any court of equity having jurisdiction in the premises, Lessor shall be entitled to a decree against Lessee requiring specific performance of the covenants of Lessee set forth in this Section 14 . If Lessee fails to return Equipment pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the terms and conditions of the Lease shall remain in full force and effect and Lessee shall be obligated to pay to Lessor Rent during each month (or any part thereof) when Lessor is not in possession of the Equipment after the end of the Term of the Lease (the Holdover Period in an amount equal to one and one-quarter (1.25) times the monthly (or other applicable increment) rental payments required during the Term of the Lease. 15. GENERAL INDEMNITY. Each Lease is a net lease. Therefore, Lessee shall indemnify Lessor and its successors and assigns and each of their agents, officers, directors, members, managers, affiliates and employees (each an Indemnitee against, and hold each such Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all Claims (other than to the extent such a Claim (i) results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, (ii) is caused by or is attributable to Lessor s breach of its express obligations or representations under this Lease, unless such breach is caused or results from a Default, (iii) is caused by or attributable to any voluntary sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition by such Indemnitee of the Equipment or any interest therein that is not a replacement thereof under this Lease or is otherwise not contemplated under the Lease, unless such sale, transfer or other disposition has resulted from or occurred following an Event of Default, (iv) is a claim which is expressly to be borne by Lessor under the terms of the Lease, (v) arises as a result of a Lessor s Lien or (vi) comprises

of any amounts ordinarily payable by Lessor under or in connection with any financing or refinancing of the Equipment), by paying (on an after-tax basis) or otherwise discharging same, when and as such Claims shall become due, including Claims arising on account of any Lease or the Equipment, or any part thereof, including the ordering, acquisition, delivery, installation or rejection of the Equipment, the possession, maintenance, use, condition, ownership or operation of any item of Equipment, and by whomsoever owned, used or operated, during the term of any Lease hereunder with respect to that item of Equipment, the existence of latent and other defects (whether or not discoverable by Lessor or Lessee), any claim in tort for negligence or strict liability, any claim for patent, trademark or copyright infringement, any claim for the loss, damage, destruction, removal, return, surrender, sale or other disposition of the Equipment or any item thereof, any claim arising from breach of any environmental law, or for whatever other reason whatsoever. It is the express intention of both Lessor and Lessee that the indemnity provided for in this Section includes the agreement by Lessee to indemnify the Indemnitees from the consequences of such Indemnitees own simple negligence, whether that negligence is the sole or concurring cause of the Claims, and to further indemnify such Indemnitees with respect to Claims for which the Indemnitees are strictly liable. Lessor or the Indemnitee affected thereby, shall give Lessee prompt notice of any Claim hereby indemnified against and, subject to the rights of insurers under any applicable policies of insurance, Lessee shall be entitled to control the defense thereof, so long as no payment default, bankruptcy or insolvency default or Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing and such Claim does not involve the possibility of criminal sanctions on any Indemnitee. For the purposes of this Lease, the term Claims shall mean all claims, allegations, harms, judgments, good faith settlements entered into, suits, actions, debts, obligations, damages (whether incidental, consequential or direct), demands (for compensation, indemnification, reimbursement or otherwise), losses, penalties, fines, liabilities (including strict liability), charges that any Indemnitee has incurred or for which it is responsible, in the nature of interest, Liens (other than Lessor s Liens), and costs (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements and any other reasonable legal or non-legal expenses of investigation or defense of any Claim, whether or not such Claim is ultimately defeated or incurred in enforcing the rights, remedies or indemnities provided for hereunder, or otherwise available at law or equity to Lessor), of whatever kind or nature, contingent or otherwise, matured or unmatured, foreseeable or unforeseeable, by or against any person or entity; provided , however , Lessee s indemnity obligation under this Section 15 shall exclude (a) any Claims that arise after Lessor or Lessor s purchaser or lessee has taken possession of the Equipment after termination of the Lease and which are not related to any act or omission of Lessee, (b) Claims for taxes (it being agreed that Lessee s indemnification obligations with respect to taxes are set forth in Sections 12 and 16 ), (c) Claims expressly excluded as set forth hereinabove. For avoidance of doubt, the indemnity is not limited to claims by third parties (other than ordinary and usual operating and overhead expenses). The provisions of this Section 15 with regard to matters arising during a Lease Term shall survive the expiration or termination of such Lease. 16. TAX INDEMNIFICATION. Lessee acknowledges that Lessor, in determining the Rent due under the Lease, has assumed it is entitled to certain depreciation deductions with respect to the Equipment Cost (as defined in the Schedule) for tax purposes that are available to an owner of property with the same depreciation classification as the Equipment under Section 168(b) of the Code and under applicable state tax law on the basis of a permitted recovery period, the 200 percent declining balance (or other permitted) method, using the any permitted convention and assuming salvage value is zero (the Tax Benefits ). If as a result of any act (other than one permitted under this Agreement or the Schedule)), omission, breach of warranty or covenant or misrepresentation by Lessee (a Lessee Action ), (i) all or any part of the Tax Benefits are lost, recaptured or deferred or (ii) Lessor is required to include in income any amount other than (A) Rent at the times such Rent is allocable in accordance with the terms of the Lease, (B) gain or other income realized by the Lessor in respect of payments of Stipulated Loss Value, (C) gain or other income realized by Lessor on a sale or other disposition of the Equipment if such sale shall not occur pursuant to the exercise of remedies during the continuance of an Event of Default or (D) any amount payable to Lessor on overdue payments as specified in the Lease (a Loss ), Lessee shall pay Lessor, for each applicable Lease, as additional rent on each date that Rent would otherwise be due, an amount needed to provide Lessor with the same after-tax yield and after-tax cash flow as of such date Net Return ), but without duplication, as would have been realized by Lessor at such date had Lessor not incurred the Loss Additional Rent ). The Additional Rent shall be computed by Lessor, which shall be subject to verification if requested by Lessee pursuant to this Section 16 . Lessor will promptly notify Lessee of any claim that may give rise to indemnity hereunder. At Lessee s reasonable written request, Lessor shall contest any such claim (at Lessee s sole cost and expense) until a Final Determination is reached; provided that Lessee has confirmed in writing its liability for the amounts should it lose the contest and the contest does not create a material risk of sale, loss or forfeiture of the Equipment or otherwise create a material adverse impact on Lessor s interest in the Equipment (as determined in Lessor s sole good faith discretion) provided , further , that Lessor shall have no obligation to contest such claim beyond the administrative level of the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority. In any event, Lessor shall control all aspects of the contest, provided Lessor shall keep Lessee reasonably informed regarding the status of such contest, allow Lessee to participate in the contest at its own expense and with counsel of its choice and shall not settle the contest without the written consent of Lessee, which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If such administrative appeals are not successful, Lessor agrees to consult with Lessee to consider bringing a judicial action; however, the ultimate decision to bring a judicial action or not shall be made by Lessor in its good faith discretion. Lessee agrees to pay, promptly upon Lessor s written demand, all documented legal fees and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lessor in defending any such claim even if Lessor s defense is unsuccessful. A Final Determination shall mean (i) a decision, judgment, decree or other order by a court of competent jurisdiction, which decision, judgment, decree or other order has become final after all allowable appeals (other than appeals to the United States Supreme Court) by either party to the action have been exhausted or the time for filing such appeals has expired, a (ii) a closing agreement entered into by Lessor in good faith under Section 7121 of the Code or any other settlement agreement entered into in connection with an administrative or judicial proceeding, (iii) the expiration of time for instituting a claim for refund, or if such a claim was filed, the expiration of the time for instituting suit with respect thereto or (iv) the expiration of the time for instituting suit with respect to the claimed deficiency. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee shall have no obligations to indemnify Lessor for any Loss that results from (a) a casualty to the Equipment if Lessee pays the amount Lessee is required to pay as a result of such casualty, (b) Lessor s sale of the Equipment or its interest in the Lease other than pursuant to the exercise of remedies following an Event of Default hereunder, (c) failure of Lessor to have sufficient income to utilize the Tax Benefits, to timely or properly claim such Tax Benefits or to report rent and interest for federal and state income tax purposes in accordance with the Schedule, (d) an event requiring Lessee to pay Lessor s Loss (or an amount calculated by reference thereto) and such amount is paid in full at the time and manner provided by the Lease, (e) the failure of the Lease to be a true lease for federal income 
 Master Lease (Calumet Montana Refining, LLC) Page 7 VP/#68122827.3 

tax purposes or the failure of the Lease to have economic substance within the meaning of Section 7701(o) of the Code (in each case, other than due to a Lessee Action), (f) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lessor or (g) a change in tax law (including tax rates) effective after the Lease begins. Any Additional Rent due under this Section 16 for a Loss shall be payable upon the occurrence of the latest of (i) thirty (30) days after the date of Lessor s notice to Lessee pursuant to this Section 16 or (ii) five (5) days after the completion of any contest requested by Lessee pursuant to this Section 16 , provided , however , that Lessee shall not be permitted to defer payment of Additional Rent beyond the date Lessor shall be required to pay the additional taxes giving rise to such Additional Rent payable by Lessee (taking into account any payment deferral allowed by a contest of the applicable tax claim); provided , further however , that if Lessee shall elect to pay such sum before the later of the dates specified in (i) and (ii) above, Lessee shall not be required to pay Lessor the amount of any interest that shall be attributable to the period after such payment by Lessee. Lessor shall provide Lessee with supporting computation of the Loss for which Additional Rent is claimed. If Lessee elects to contest a Loss in accordance with this Section 16 and if there is a Final Determination which clearly establishes that the tax payable by Lessor is less than the Additional Rent payment made by Lessee, Lessor shall refund the difference to Lessee, less Lessor s unreimbursed out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with such contest. If Additional Rent is due hereunder, Lessor shall in good faith calculate the amount necessary to maintain the same Net Return that Lessor would have realized from time to time had Lessor not incurred the Loss and provide Lessee a written explanation of the rationale for the Net Return used and the calculation of the payment due. If Lessee does not object in writing to such rationale and calculation within thirty (30) days, such rationale and calculation shall be binding on Lessee and Lessor. If Lessee does provide written notice of its reasonable objection thereto within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice from Lessor, Lessor shall nominate a Big 4 accounting firm that is reasonably acceptable to Lessee and which is not the financial statement auditor of either Lessee or Lessor to review Lessor s rationale of its Net Return and explanation of the amount due and Lessee s objections thereto. Absent manifest error, such accounting firm s determination of Lessor s Net Return and the Additional Rent due hereunder shall be final and binding on the parties. The Parties shall request that such accounting firm make its determination no later than twenty (20) days of the request therefor. Such accounting firm s fees shall be paid by Lessee, unless such accounting firm determines that the Additional Rent actually due is ninety-five percent (95 percent or less than the amount determined by Lessor. If Lessor, as a result of a Loss occurring with respect to any year under circumstances that require Lessee to indemnify Lessor with respect to such Loss, shall actually realize, with respect to any year, income tax savings (including, without limitation, by reason of any refunds of or credits against tax) that would not have been realized but for such Loss or the event giving rise thereto, and such savings were not previously taken into account in computing the indemnity amount paid to Lessor, Lessor shall pay to Lessee an amount equal to such income tax savings that it actually realizes plus the amount of any income tax savings that it actually realizes as the result of any payment made pursuant to this sentence (calculated in accordance with the same methodology used to determine Lessor s Net Return); provided , however , the sum of all payments by Lessor to Lessee pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the sum of all prior indemnity payments to Lessor by Lessee pursuant to this Section 16 less the amount of all prior payments by Lessor to Lessee under this paragraph; provided , further , that Lessor will be under no obligation to make any payment contemplated under this paragraph if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Any subsequent loss of income tax savings realized by Lessor in calculating such reverse indemnity payment to Lessee pursuant to this paragraph shall be indemnifiable as a Loss without regard to the exclusions in this Section 16 (other than the exclusion for the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lessor). Any payment due to Lessee pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid within thirty (30) days after Lessor has actually realized such tax savings. Lessor shall in good faith use diligence in claiming and pursuing refunds and tax benefits that would result in payments to Lessee under this paragraph; provided , that all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Lessor in connection therewith shall be for the account of Lessee and shall be paid by Lessee. 17. ASSIGNMENT BY LESSEE PROHIBITED. LESSEE SHALL NOT, WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF LESSOR, (i) ASSIGN, TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF ANY LEASE OR PROPERTY, OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN (EXCEPT FOR DISPOSITIONS OF THE PROPERTY EXPRESSLY PERMITTED HEREBY); or (ii) SUBLEASE OR LEND ANY EQUIPMENT OR PERMIT IT TO BE USED BY ANYONE OTHER THAN LESSEE AND ITS EMPLOYEES (EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN A SCHEDULE). 18. ASSIGNMENT BY LESSOR. Lessor and its successors and assigns may sell, assign, transfer or syndicate its rights, title and interest in and to any Lease and the Equipment, individually or together, in whole or in part, and/or grant or assign a security interest in any Lease and the Equipment individually or together, in whole or in part; provided , however , that so long as no Event of Default or event which with the giving of notice, the passage of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default shall have occurred, Lessor shall not make any assignment to any entity not affiliated with Lessor without obtaining Lessee s prior written consent, which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and Lessee shall enjoy its right to quiet enjoyment as set forth in Section 24 below. Each such assignee shall have all of the rights of Lessor under each Lease assigned to it. Lessee shall not assert against any such assignee any claims or defenses by way of abatement, set-off, counterclaim or recoupment that Lessee may have against Lessor or any other person or entity. Upon receipt of written notice of Lessor s assignment of all or any part of its interest in any Lease, Lessee agrees to attorn to and recognize any such assignee as the owner of such assigned Lessor s interest in any Lease and Lessee shall thereafter make such payments, including without limitation such Rent as are indicated in the notice of assignment, to such assignee. No such Lessor assignment will alter the terms and conditions of the relevant Lease or expand, enlarge or modify the obligations of Lessee. Notwithstanding any such assignment, Lessee will continue to deal directly and solely with Stonebriar Commercial Finance LLC as administrative agent for the lessors (whether one or more), including affiliates of Lessor, until such time as Lessee has received written notice that such administrative agent has been replaced and Lessee has had reasonable time to acknowledge such notice. Lessee agrees that Lessor may disclose information regarding Lessee and the transactions to any such assignee, potential assignee, rating agency or other party in connection with any such Lessor assignment so long as such party is informed
