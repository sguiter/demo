 Basic net loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period without consideration for potentially dilutive securities. Because we have reported a net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the number of shares used to calculate diluted net loss per common share is the same as the number of shares used to calculate basic net loss per common share for those periods given that the potentially dilutive shares would have been anti-dilutive if included in the calculation.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below, elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, particularly in the sections entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. 
 
 Overview 
 We are the standard in managing and securing Apple at work, and we are the only company in the world that provides a complete management and security solution for an Apple-first environment that is designed to be enterprise secure, consumer simple, and protective of personal privacy. We help IT and security teams confidently protect the devices, data, and applications used by their workforce, while providing employees with the powerful and intended Apple experience. With Jamf s software, devices can be deployed to employees brand new in the shrink-wrapped box, set up automatically and personalized at first power-on and administered continuously throughout the lifecycle of the device. 
 Jamf was founded in 2002, around the same time that Apple was leading an industry transformation. Apple transformed the way people access and utilize technology through its focus on creating a superior consumer experience. With the release of revolutionary products like the Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, Apple built one of the world s most valuable brands and became ubiquitous in everyday life. 
 We have built our company through a primary focus on being the leading solution for Apple in the enterprise because we believe that due to Apple s broad range of devices, combined with the changing demographics of today s workforce and their strong preference for Apple, that Apple will become the number one device ecosystem in the enterprise by the end of this decade. We believe that the enterprise management provider that is best at Apple will one day be the enterprise leader, and that Jamf is best positioned for that leadership. Through our long-standing relationship with Apple, we have accumulated significant Apple technical experience and expertise that give us the ability to fully and quickly leverage and extend the capabilities of Apple products, operating systems, and services, while protecting devices with our differentiated Apple-first security solutions. This expertise enables us to fully support new innovations and operating system releases the moment they are made available by Apple. This focus has allowed us to create a best-in-class user experience in the enterprise. 
 We sell our SaaS solutions via a subscription model, through a direct sales force, online, and indirectly via our channel partners, including Apple. Our multi-dimensional go-to-market model and primarily cloud-deployed offering enable us to reach all organizations around the world, large and small, with our software solutions. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 New customer growth. Our ability to attract new customers is dependent upon a number of factors, including the effectiveness of our pricing and solutions, the features and pricing of our competitors offerings, the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, the effectiveness of our channel partners in selling, marketing, and deploying our software solutions, and the growth of the market for devices and services for SMBs, enterprises, and other organizations. Sustaining our growth requires continued adoption of our platform by new customers. We intend to continue to invest in building brand awareness as we further penetrate our addressable markets. We intend to expand our customer base by continuing to make significant and targeted investments in our direct sales and marketing to attract new customers and to drive broader awareness of our software solutions. 
 Existing customer retention and expansion. Our ability to increase revenue depends in large part on our ability to retain our existing customers and increase revenue from our existing customer base. Customer retention and expansion is dependent upon a number of factors, including their satisfaction with our software solutions and support, the features and pricing of our competitors offerings, and our ability to effectively enhance our platform by developing new products and features and addressing additional use cases. Often our customers will begin with a small deployment and then later expand 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 their usage more broadly within the organization as they realize the benefits of our platform. We believe that our land and expand business model allows us to efficiently increase revenue from our existing customer base. We intend to continue to invest in enhancing awareness of our software solutions, creating additional use cases, and developing more products, features, and functionality, which we believe are important factors to expand usage of our software solutions by our existing customer base. We believe our ability to retain and expand usage of our software solutions by our existing customer base is evidenced by our dollar-based net retention rate. 
 Product innovation and technology leadership. Our success is dependent on our ability to sustain product innovation and technology leadership in order to maintain our competitive advantage. We believe that we have built a highly differentiated platform, and we intend to further extend the adoption of our platform through additional innovation. While sales of subscriptions to our Jamf Pro product account for a substantial portion of our revenue, we intend to continue to invest in building additional products, features, and functionality that expand our capabilities and facilitate the extension of our platform to new use cases. Our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop, market, and sell additional products to both new and existing customers. For example, we announced Jamf Executive Threat Protection in April 2023, as an advanced detection and response tool designed for mobile devices that provides organizations with an efficient, remote method to monitor devices and respond to advanced attacks. 
 Investment in growth. Our ability to effectively invest for growth is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to offset anticipated increases in operating expenses with revenue growth, our ability to spend our research and development budget efficiently or effectively on compelling innovation and technologies, our ability to accurately predict costs, and our ability to maintain our corporate culture as our business evolves. We plan to continue strategically investing in our business so we can capitalize on our market opportunity. We intend to invest in our sales team to target expansion within our midmarket and enterprise customers and to attract new customers. We expect to continue to make strategically focused investments in marketing to drive brand awareness and enhance the effectiveness of our customer acquisition model. We also intend to continue to invest in our research and development team to develop new and improved products, features, and functionality. Although these investments may increase our operating expenses in certain periods and, as a result, adversely affect our operating results in the near term, we believe they will contribute to our long-term growth. 
 International expansion. Our international growth in any region depends on our ability to effectively implement our business processes and go-to-market strategy, our ability to adapt to market or cultural differences, the general competitive landscape, our ability to invest in our sales and marketing channels, the maturity and growth trajectory of devices and services by region, and our brand awareness and perception. In addition, global demand for our platform and the growth of our international operations is dependent upon the rate of market adoption of Apple products in international markets. We plan to continue making investments in our international sales and marketing channels to take advantage of this market opportunity while refining our go-to-market approach based on local market dynamics. While we believe global demand for our platform will increase as international adoption of Apple products and market awareness of Jamf grows, our ability to conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and regulatory systems (including with respect to data transfer and privacy), alternative dispute systems, commercial markets, and geopolitical challenges. 
 Partner network development. Our success is dependent not only on our independent efforts to innovate, scale, and reach more customers directly but also on the success of our partners to continue to gain share in the enterprise. With a focus on the user and being the bridge between critical technologies with Apple, Microsoft, AWS, Google, and Okta as examples we believe we can help other market participants deliver more to enterprise users with the power of Jamf. We will continue to invest in the relationships with our existing, critical partners, nurture and develop new relationships, and do so globally. We will continue to invest in developing plus one solutions and workflows that help tie our software solutions together with those delivered by others. 
 General and industry-specific economic and market conditions and reductions in IT spending. Our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows depend on the overall demand for our products. The U.S. and other key international economies continue to be impacted, although to a lesser extent, by high levels of inflation, elevated interest rates, financial instability and concerns about volatility in credit, equity, and foreign exchange markets, and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These factors could continue to pose the risk of reductions in IT spending by our existing and prospective customers or in requests to renegotiate existing contracts, defaults on payments due on existing contracts, or non-renewals. As result of macroeconomic uncertainty, some of our customers have taken a more moderate outlook when planning their future hiring and device growth needs. We expect these conditions to continue through the remainder of 2024. 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 In addition, on January 25, 2024, the Company announced a workforce reduction plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins, and continue advancing the Company s ongoing commitment to profitable growth in light of macroeconomic conditions. The workforce reduction plan impacted approximately 6 of the Company s full-time employees. A majority of these charges were incurred in the first quarter of 2024, and the execution of the workforce reduction plan was substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of 2024. See Note 13 for additional information. 
 
 Key Business Metrics 
 In addition to our GAAP financial information, we review several operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. 
 Number of Devices 
 We believe our ability to grow the number of devices on our software platform provides a key indicator of the growth of our business and our future business opportunities. We define a device at the end of any particular period as a device owned by a customer, which device has at least one Jamf product pursuant to an active subscription or support and maintenance agreement or that has a reasonable probability of renewal. We define a customer at the end of any particular period as an entity with at least one active subscription or support and maintenance agreement as of the measurement date or that has a reasonable probability of renewal. A single organization with separate subsidiaries, segments, or divisions that use our platform may represent multiple customers as we treat each entity, subsidiary, segment, or division that is invoiced separately as a single customer. In cases where customers subscribe to our platform through our channel partners, each end customer is counted separately. A single customer may have multiple Jamf products on a single device, but we still would only count that as one device. 
 The number of devices on our software platform was 33.9 million and 31.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a 7 year-over-year growth rate. The increase in number of devices reflects our growth across industries, products, and geographies. Customer and device counts have been adjusted as a result of our recent comprehensive systems update. In addition, revenue for certain licenses has expired in this period and therefore those customers and devices have been removed from our counts. 
 Annual Recurring Revenue 
 ARR represents the annualized value of all subscription and support and maintenance contracts as of the end of the period. ARR mitigates fluctuations due to seasonality, contract term, and the sales mix of subscriptions for term-based licenses and SaaS. ARR is calculated on a constant currency basis using a rate that estimates the exchange rate at the beginning of the year. ARR does not have any standardized meaning and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers. 
 Our ARR was 635.0 million and 566.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is an increase of 12 year-over-year. The growth in our ARR was primarily driven by device expansion, cross-selling additional solutions to our installed customer base, and the addition of new customers. 
 Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate 
 To further illustrate the land and expand economics of our customer relationships, we examine the rate at which our customers increase their subscriptions for our software solutions. Our dollar-based net retention rate measures our ability to increase revenue across our existing customer base through expanded use of our software solutions, offset by customers whose subscription contracts with us are not renewed or renew at a lower amount. 
 We calculate dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with Prior Period ARR. We then calculate the Current Period ARR. Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. We then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate. 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 Our dollar-based net retention rates were 106 and 108 for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our high dollar-based net retention rates are primarily attributable to an expansion of devices and our ability to cross-sell our new solutions to our installed customer base. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We recognize revenue under ASC 606 when or as performance obligations are satisfied. We derive revenue primarily from sales of SaaS subscriptions and support and maintenance contracts and, to a lesser extent, sales of on-premise term-based subscriptions and perpetual licenses and services. 
 Subscription . Subscription revenue consists of sales of SaaS subscriptions and on-premise term-based subscription licenses as well as support and maintenance contracts. We sell our software solutions primarily with a one-year contract term. We typically invoice SaaS subscription fees and support and maintenance fees annually in advance and recognize revenue ratably over the term of the applicable agreement, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. The license portion of on-premise subscription revenue is recognized upfront, assuming all revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information. 
 Services. Services revenue consists primarily of professional services provided to our customers to configure and optimize the use of our software solutions, as well as training services related to the operation of our software solutions. Our services are priced on a fixed fee basis and generally invoiced in advance of the service being delivered. Revenue is recognized as the services are performed. 
 License. License revenue consists of revenue from on-premise perpetual licenses of our Jamf Pro product sold primarily to existing customers. We recognize license revenue upfront, assuming all revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of subscription. Cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of employee compensation costs for employees associated with supporting our subscription and support and maintenance arrangements, our customer success function, and third-party hosting fees related to our cloud services. Employee compensation and related costs include cash compensation and benefits to employees and associated overhead costs. 
 Cost of services. Cost of services revenue consists primarily of employee compensation costs directly associated with delivery of professional services and training, costs of third-party integrators, and other associated overhead costs. 
 Amortization. Amortization expense consists of amortization of acquired intangible assets. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit, or revenue less cost of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the mix of cloud-based subscription customers, the costs associated with supporting our cloud solution, the extent to which we expand our customer support team, and the extent to which we can increase the efficiency of our technology and infrastructure through technological improvements. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs, sales commissions, costs of general marketing and promotional activities, travel-related expenses, restructuring charges, and allocated overhead. Sales commissions as well as associated payroll taxes and retirement plan contributions (together, contract costs that are incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts are capitalized and amortized over the period of benefit, which is estimated to be generally five years. 
 Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, restructuring charges, and allocated overhead. We will continue to invest in innovation so that we can offer our customers new solutions and 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 enhance our existing solutions. See Business Research and Development in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information. 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs for corporate personnel, such as those in our executive, human resource, facilities, accounting and finance, legal and compliance, and IT departments. General and administrative expenses also include non-personnel costs such as legal, accounting, and other professional fees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include acquisition and integration-related expenses which primarily consist of third-party expenses, such as legal and accounting fees, as well as expense recognized for deferred compensation related to the acquisition of dataJAR. General and administrative expenses also include system transformation costs, which are primarily associated with the implementation of sales software and software supporting our business including enterprise resource planning, as well as the implementation of other systems to provide best-in-class processes, governance, and systems. General and administrative expenses also include restructuring charges. 
 Amortization. Amortization expense consists of amortization of acquired intangible assets. 
 Interest Income, Net 
 Interest income, net primarily consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents as well as interest charges and amortization of capitalized issuance costs related to our 2026 Notes. 
 Foreign Currency Transaction Gain (Loss) 
 Foreign currency transaction gain (loss) includes gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the Company s functional currency, the U.S. dollar. 
 Income Tax (Provision) Benefit 
 Income tax (provision) benefit consists primarily of income taxes related to U.S. federal and state income taxes and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because they provide consistency and comparability with our past financial performance (for example, by eliminating items that fluctuate for reasons unrelated to operating performance or that represent non-recurring, one-time events), provide additional understanding of factors and trends affecting our business, and assist in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP information to supplement their GAAP results. 
 Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude certain expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements, including stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by our management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Further, non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized. It may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. While the amortization expense of acquired intangible assets is excluded from certain non-GAAP measures, the revenue related to acquired intangible assets is reflected in such measures as those assets contribute to revenue generation. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. In addition, investors are encouraged to review our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 
 Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin 
 We use non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin, and believe it is useful to our investors, to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. We define non-

Table of Contents 

 GAAP gross profit as gross profit, adjusted for amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense, payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, system transformation costs, and restructuring charges. Acquisition-related expense includes acquisition and integration-related expenses which primarily consist of third-party expenses, such as legal and accounting fees, as well as expense recognized for deferred compensation related to the acquisition of dataJAR. System transformation costs are primarily associated with the implementation of updated sales software and software supporting our business including enterprise resource planning, as well as the implementation of other systems to provide best-in-class processes, governance, and systems. The transformation includes a comprehensive redesign of our systems, including the quoting, contracting, and invoicing processes, and the systems and tools we use. Restructuring charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily include severance payments related to the workforce reduction plan announced in January 2024. We define non-GAAP gross profit margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of total revenue. 
 A reconciliation of non-GAAP gross profit to gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin to gross profit margin, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are as follows:

 Non-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Income Margin 
 We use non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating income margin, and believe it is useful for our investors, to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. We define non-GAAP operating income as operating loss, adjusted for amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense, offering costs, payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, system transformation costs, restructuring charges, and extraordinary legal settlements and non-recurring litigation costs. We define non-GAAP operating income margin as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of total revenue.

 Non-GAAP Net Income 
 We use non-GAAP net income, and believe it is useful for our investors, to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends. We define non-GAAP net income as net loss, adjusted for income tax (provision) benefit, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, foreign currency transaction (gain) loss, amortization of debt issuance costs, acquisition-related expense, offering costs, payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, system transformation costs, restructuring charges, and extraordinary legal settlements and non-recurring litigation costs, and adjustment to income tax expense based on the non-GAAP measure of profitability using our blended U.S. statutory tax rate. 
 We define non-GAAP income before income taxes as loss before income taxes adjusted for amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, foreign currency transaction (gain) loss, amortization of debt issuance costs, acquisition-related expense, offering costs, payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, system transformation costs, restructuring charges, and extraordinary legal settlements and non-recurring litigation costs. 
 We define non-GAAP provision for income taxes as the current and deferred income tax expense commensurate with the non-GAAP measure of profitability using our blended U.S. statutory tax rate.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling 218.4 million, which were held for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions, as well as the available balance of the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility of 174.0 million. On May 3, 2024, the Company entered into the 2024 Credit Agreement to refinance the Company s existing 2020 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2024 Credit Agreement increased our revolving credit facility commitments from 150.0 million to 175.0 million and has a scheduled maturity date of May 3, 2029. The 2024 Credit Agreement is subject to a springing maturity date on or after June 2, 2026 subject to the terms of the the 2024 Credit Agreement. Our cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash, money market deposit accounts, and money market funds with original maturities at the time of purchase of three months or less. Our cash and cash equivalents are held at a diversified portfolio of investment grade global banks and money market investments. We expect that our operating cash flows, in addition to our cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to make continued investments in supporting the growth of our business in the future. 
 A majority of our customers pay in advance for subscriptions and support and maintenance contracts, a portion of which is recorded as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue consists of the unearned portion of billed fees for our subscriptions, which is later recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. As of September 30, 2024, we had deferred revenue of 378.2 million, of which 326.1 million was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the 2024 Credit Agreement, other than 1.0 million in outstanding letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, there was 368.9 million outstanding on our 2026 Notes, which mature on September 1, 2026. See Note 8 for additional information on our 2024 Credit Agreement and 2026 Notes. 
 In May 2024, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 2,000,000 shares of our common stock from underwriters in a secondary offering by funds affiliated with Vista for an aggregate purchase price of 35.4 million in connection with Vista s sale of shares through an underwritten secondary offering. See Note 2 for more information. 
 Future Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements 
 We believe our cash and cash equivalents, the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, and cash provided by sales of our software solutions and services will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, debt service requirements for at least the next 12 months, as well as other known long-term cash requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the future, we may use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal commitments consist of obligations under our 2026 Notes, contractual agreements for hosting services and other support software, and operating leases for office space. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a contractual agreement with an unrelated party for hosting services, which includes a non-cancelable commitment of 30.4 million over the next five years. There have been no other material changes to our commitments as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents a summary of our condensed consolidated cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 
 21,516 20,045 Net cash used in investing activities (9,477) (22,083) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities 
 (40,863) 5,157 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 102 (190) Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 
 (28,722) 2,929 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of period 250,809 231,921 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of period 222,087 234,850 Cash paid for interest 727 704 Cash paid for purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements 6,674 2,522 
 Operating Activities 
 Our largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our subscription customers. Our primary use of cash from operating activities is employee-related expenditures, marketing expenses, and third-party hosting costs. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 21.5 million, an increase of 1.5 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash received from our customers and 6.0 million we paid for contingent consideration in 2023 related to the Digita acquisition, partially offset by a 16.8 million increase in cash paid for system transformation costs, 9.0 million of restructuring charges paid, 8.4 million paid in deferred consideration related to the dataJAR acquisition, and an increase in cash paid for third-party hosting costs. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 9.5 million, a decrease of 12.6 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to an 18.8 million decrease in payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by a 4.2 million increase in purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements and a 1.8 million increase in purchases of investments. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 40.9 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily attributable to 35.4 million paid for the repurchase and retirement of common stock, 3.6 million for the release of the ZecOps escrow, 3.2 million for the release of the dataJAR escrow, 1.5 million paid for debt issuance costs related to refinancing the revolving credit facility, 0.9 million paid for offering costs, and a 1.9 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 
 Indemnification Agreements 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify customers, channel partners, vendors, lessors, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or other violation claims made by third parties. See Risk Factors We have indemnity provisions under our contracts with our customers, channel partners, and other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain officers that will require us, among 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers, or employees. No demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such agreements, and there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, or condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. We base our estimates on experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from those estimates, impacting our reported results of operations and financial condition. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more detailed information regarding these and other accounting policies. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a description of our recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted, see Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There were no material changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a detailed discussion of our market risks. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we implemented updated sales software and a new enterprise resource planning system, as well as other systems. The transformation included a comprehensive redesign of our systems, including the quoting, contracting, and invoicing processes, and the systems and tools we use. This implementation resulted in certain changes to our reporting processes and our internal control over financial reporting by automating certain manual procedures and standardizing business processes and reporting across the organization. The implementation was subject to various testing and review procedures prior to and after execution. We will continue to monitor our internal control over financial reporting under the new systems, including evaluating the operating effectiveness of related key controls. 
 There were no other changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The information set forth in Note 7 Commitments and contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference. 
 From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims, including patent, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower, and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. In addition, third parties may from time to time assert claims against us in the form of letters and other communications. Although the results of these proceedings, claims, inquiries, and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our evaluation of any current matters may change in the future as the legal proceedings and claims and events related thereto unfold. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves, our partners, and our customers by determining the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.
