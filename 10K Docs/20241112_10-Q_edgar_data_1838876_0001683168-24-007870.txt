Item 2. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations 

Overview 

We were incorporated in Colorado
on December 2, 2020. We acquired all rights to what we formerly called the GSP system on March 9, 2021 from Fourth Wave Energy, Inc ("FWAV")
in return for the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock to FWAV. FWAV has distributed Spin-Off these shares
to its shareholders. 

We also assumed all liabilities
(approximately 380,000) associated with seven consulting agreements previously signed by FWAV. The agreements with the consultants generally
provided that the consultants would advise FWAV in matters concerning the development of the GSP systems in newly built and existing residences
as well as new apartments and commercial buildings. Although these consulting agreements have since expired, we still owe approximately
 380,000 to the former consultants. 

SmartGreen Home system 

The SmartGreen Home
system SGH system formerly the GSP system) is based on combining solar power and other energy efficient technologies into
one fully integrated system. The SGH system is designed to significantly reduce energy consumption and associated carbon emissions in
residences and commercial buildings. 

The SGH system is: 

Powered by solar photovoltaics and is managed with direct current advanced energy management controls 

Uses: 

Geothermal heating and cooling 

Efficient HVAC; 

LED lighting; 

Solar energy for hot water heating; 

Improved insulation; and 

Advanced air filtration and ventilation. 

We plan to use a national
network of solar contractors throughout the US to market and install the SGH system directly to homeowners. 

We plan to use independent
subcontractors to replace a home s existing heating and air conditioning system with the SGH system. We estimate that the removal
of an existing HVAC system and the installation of the SGH system will cost approximately 75,000 after tax credits and require approximately
20 days to complete. 

It is believed the installation
of the SGH system will result in a more valuable, cleaner and healthier home and is highly economic for the homeowner. 

We believe the SGH system
represents an important advancement in the way homes are cooled, heated and powered and that the market for the SGH system will be substantial. 

We also are marketing the
SmartGreen Home system in neighborhoods. 

As of September 30, 2024 we
were in the development stage.

The unaudited consolidated
financial statements accompanying the report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will be able to meet our
obligations and continue our operations for our next fiscal year. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values
as shown and the consolidated financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and
classification of assets and liabilities should we be unable to continue as a going concern. At September 30, 2024, we had not generated
any revenue and had not yet achieved profitable operations and expect to incur further losses in the development of our business, all
of which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our
liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern
but considers that we will be able to obtain additional funds by equity financing and/or related party advances. 

There is no assurance that
we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. We are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet
our immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed
or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a
timely basis, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business.

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the direction and with
the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, the Company
has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of September
30, 2024. The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in its periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and regulations, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching
its desired disclosure control objectives. Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There was no change in the
Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
