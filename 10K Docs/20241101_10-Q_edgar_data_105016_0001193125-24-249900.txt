joint ventures with Carrier Global Corporation, which we refer to as Carrier, in which we have a controlling interest, the accounts of Carrier InterAmerica Corporation and Carrier (Puerto Rico), Inc., in each of which we have an 80 controlling interest, and Carrier has a 20 non-controlling
 interest, and our 38.4 investment in Russell Sigler, Inc., which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 The results of operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal. Furthermore, profitability can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, particularly during the Summer and Winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is typically highest in the second and third quarters, and demand for heating equipment is usually highest in the first and fourth quarters. Demand related to the new construction sectors throughout most of the markets we serve tends to be fairly evenly distributed throughout the year and depends largely on housing completions and related weather and economic conditions.

Company Overview Watsco, Inc. was incorporated in Florida in 1956, and, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, Watsco, the Company, or we, us, or our is the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration equipment, and related parts and supplies HVAC/R in the HVAC/R distribution industry in North America. At September 30, 2024, we operated from 689 locations in 43 U.S. States, Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico with additional market coverage on an export basis to portions of Latin America and the Caribbean. Revenues primarily consist of sales of air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration equipment, and related parts and supplies. Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of selling expenses, the largest components of which are salaries, commissions, and marketing expenses that are variable and correlate to changes in sales. Other significant selling, general and administrative expenses relate to the operation of warehouse facilities, including a fleet of trucks and forklifts, and facility rent, a majority of which we operate under non-cancelable operating leases.

Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal. Furthermore, profitability can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, particularly during the Summer and Winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is typically highest in the second and third quarters, and demand for heating equipment is usually highest in the first and fourth quarters. Demand related to the new construction sectors throughout most of the markets we serve tends to be fairly evenly distributed throughout the year and depends largely on housing completions and related weather and economic conditions. Climate Change and Reductions in CO 2 e Emissions We believe that our business plays an important and significant role in the drive to lower CO 2 e emissions. According to the United States Department of Energy, heating and air conditioning accounts for roughly half of household energy consumption in the United States. As such, replacing older, less efficient HVAC systems with higher efficiency systems is one of the most meaningful steps homeowners can take to reduce their electricity costs and carbon footprints. The overwhelming majority of new HVAC systems that we sell replace systems that likely operate below current minimum efficiency standards in the United States and may use more harmful refrigerants that have been, or are being, phased-out. As consumers replace HVAC systems with new, higher-efficiency systems, homeowners will consume less energy, save costs, and reduce their carbon footprints. The sale of high-efficiency systems has long been a focus of ours, and we have invested in tools and technology intended to capture an increasingly richer sales mix over time. In addition, regulatory mandates will likely periodically increase the required minimum Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio rating, referred to as SEER, thus providing a catalyst for greater sales of higher-efficiency systems. Recently enacted regulations increased the current minimum SEER beginning in 2023 (generally, to 14 SEER from 13 SEER in the Northern U.S. and to 15 SEER from 14 SEER for the Southern U.S.). Additionally, the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 granted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate hydrofluorocarbon HFC refrigerants. Although HFCs were introduced as alternatives to ozone-depleting substances like chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons, they are now recognized as potent greenhouse gases due to their high global warming potential GWP ). Consequently, a phasedown of HFC production and consumption by 85 over a 15-year period commenced on January 1, 2022, and regulations were established requiring HVAC systems to use refrigerants with a GWP under 750 by January 1, 2025. In response to these regulations, OEMs have begun the transition to new refrigerants. These regulations advance product innovation, improve homeowner energy efficiency, reduce the carbon footprint of end-users, and increase average selling prices over time. We offer a broad variety of systems that operate above the minimum SEER standards, ranging from base-level efficiency to systems that exceed 20 SEER. Based on estimates validated by independent sources, we averted an estimated 21.8 million metric tons of CO 2 e emissions from January 1, 2020 to September 30, 2024 through the sale of replacement residential HVAC systems at higher-efficiency standards. Federal Tax Credits and State Incentives Demand for higher-efficiency products, such as variable-speed systems and heat pumps, is expected to increase due to the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA in August 2022. This legislation is intended, in part, to promote the replacement of existing systems in favor of high-efficiency heat pump systems that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as compared to older systems, and thereby combat climate change. Programs under the IRA include enhanced tax credits for homeowners who install qualifying HVAC equipment and tax deductions for owners of commercial buildings that are upgraded to achieve defined energy savings. The IRA also sets aside 4.3 billion for state-administered consumer rebate programs designed to promote energy savings for low and medium-income households, including HVAC systems. Further details, including qualifying products, specific programs, states participating, and other regulatory requirements contemplated by the IRA are still being finalized. Impact of Hurricanes Hurricane Helene interrupted sales and operations in several of our markets in the Southeastern U.S. during the last week of September 2024. The disruptions to our sales and operations did not have a significant impact on our results of operations for the third quarter or nine months ended September 30, 2024. We do not expect the disruptions related to this storm to have a material impact on future operations.

Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida on October 10, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact of that storm on our operations; however, we do not expect the disruptions caused by this storm to be material. Critical Accounting Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, management reevaluates its judgments and estimates, which are based on historical experience, current trends, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our critical accounting estimates are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024. We believe that there have been no significant changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. New Accounting Standards Refer to Note 1 to our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recently adopted, and to be adopted, accounting standards.

Income taxes represent a composite of the income taxes attributable to our wholly owned operations and income taxes attributable to our joint ventures with Carrier, which are primarily taxed as partnerships for income tax purposes; therefore, Carrier is responsible for its proportionate share of income taxes attributable to its share of earnings from these joint ventures. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to higher share-based compensation deductions combined with lower earnings in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Net Income Attributable to Watsco, Inc. Net income attributable to Watsco, Inc. for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 14.3 million, or 3 , compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by higher selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher interest income, a reduction in income taxes, and a decrease in net income attributable to the non-controlling interest. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to execute our business strategy and fund operating and investing activities, taking into consideration the seasonal demand for HVAC/R products, which peaks in the months of May through August. Significant factors that could affect our liquidity include the following: 

cash needed to fund our business (primarily working capital requirements); 

borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility; 

the timing and extent of sales of Common stock under our at-the-market offering program; 

the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms; 

acquisitions, including joint ventures and investments in unconsolidated entities; 

dividend payments; 

capital expenditures; and 

the timing and extent of common stock repurchases. Sources and Uses of Cash We rely on cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes in the short-term and the long-term, including dividend payments (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, business acquisitions, and development of our long-term operating and technology strategies. Additionally, we may also generate cash through the issuance and sale of our Common stock. We believe that the combination of our operating cash flows, cash on hand, short-term cash investments, available borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, and funds available from sales of our Common stock under our 2024 ATM Program, each of which is described below, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that our current sources of available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we had 294.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which 126.4 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. The repatriation of cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries could have adverse tax impacts or be subject to capital controls; however, these balances are generally available to fund the ordinary business operations of our foreign subsidiaries without legal restrictions. We also had 255.7 million of short-term cash investments consisting of certificates of deposit with varying maturities through March 2025. Our access to funds under our revolving credit agreement depends on the ability of the syndicate banks to meet their respective funding commitments. Disruptions in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit agreement and may also adversely affect the determination of interest rates, particularly rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), which is one of the base rates under our revolving credit agreement. SOFR has limited historical data and is a secured lending rate, whereas our revolving credit agreement is unsecured and had primarily used LIBOR, an unsecured lending rate, as a base rate prior to the discontinuation of LIBOR in 2023. The use of SOFR as a base rate under our revolving credit agreement could give rise to uncertainties and volatility in the benchmark rates. Additionally, disruptions in the credit and capital markets could also result in increased borrowing costs or reduced borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement. Working Capital Working capital increased to 2,199.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 1,679.9 million at December 31, 2023, due to: (i) higher inventory balances in connection with our selling season; (ii) higher accounts receivable consistent with the seasonal increase in sales; and (iii) 255.7 million of short-term cash investments, which were offset by an increase in accounts payable consistent with the change in inventory.

 The individual items contributing to cash flow changes for the periods presented are detailed in the condensed consolidated unaudited statements of cash flows contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in 2024 as compared to 2023 was higher primarily due to the timing of vendor payments partially offset by an increase in inventory. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to the purchase of 255.7 million of short-term cash investments in 2024. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to higher net proceeds from the sale of Common stock under our 2021 ATM Program (as defined below), a portion of which was used for short-term cash investments, partially offset by an increase in dividends paid and repayments under our revolving credit agreement in 2024. Revolving Credit Agreement We maintain an unsecured, five-year 600.0 million syndicated multicurrency revolving credit agreement, which may be used for, among other things, funding seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases, and issuances of letters of credit. The revolving credit facility has a seasonal component from October 1 to March 31, during which the borrowing capacity may be reduced to 500.0 million at our discretion (which effectively reduces fees payable in respect of the unused portion of the commitment). Included in the revolving credit facility are a 125.0 million swingline loan sublimit, a 10.0 million letter of credit sublimit, a 75.0 million alternative currency borrowing sublimit, and an 10.0 million Mexican borrowing subfacility. The revolving credit agreement matures on March 16, 2028. At September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance under the revolving credit agreement. At December 31, 2023, 15.4 million was outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, and other customary restrictions. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2024. At-the-Market Offering Program On August 6, 2021, we executed a sales agreement with Robert W. Baird Co. Inc. Baird ), which enabled the Company to issue and sell shares of Common stock in one or more negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), for a maximum aggregate offering amount of up to 300.0 million (the 2021 ATM Program ). During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we issued and sold 712,000 shares of Common stock under the 2021 ATM Program for net proceeds of 281.8 million. We used the proceeds to pay off outstanding debt under our revolving credit agreement and purchased short-term cash investments with the remainder. In aggregate, 298.5 million of Common stock was sold under the 2021 ATM Program. On May 3, 2024, we executed an amended and restated sales agreement with Baird (the 2024 ATM Program ), which enables the further issuance of up to 400.0 million of Common stock. At September 30, 2024, 400.0 million was available for sale under the 2024 ATM Program. The offer and sale of shares under the 2024 ATM Program were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to our automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-260758) that expires on November 4, 2024 and for which we plan to file a replacement automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 immediately following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Purchase Obligations At September 30, 2024, we were obligated under various non-cancelable purchase orders with our key suppliers for goods aggregating approximately 460.0 million, with approximately 250.0 million attributable to Carrier and its affiliates. These purchase obligations represent commitments under purchase orders for goods in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding with defined terms as to price, quantity, and delivery. Investment in Unconsolidated Entity Carrier Enterprise I, one of our joint ventures with Carrier, in which we have an 80 controlling interest, has a 38.4 ownership interest in RSI, an HVAC distributor operating from 35 locations in the Western U.S. Our proportionate share of the net income of RSI is included in other income in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income. Carrier Enterprise I is a party to a shareholders agreement (the Shareholders Agreement with RSI and its shareholders, consisting of five Sigler second generation family siblings and their affiliates, who collectively own 55.4 of RSI (the RSI Majority Holders and certain next-generation Sigler family members and an employee, who collectively own 6.2 of RSI (the RSI Minority Holders and, together with the RSI Majority Holders, the RSI Shareholders ). Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, the RSI Shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on the higher of book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price for its 38.4 investment held in RSI. The RSI Shareholders may transfer their respective shares of RSI common stock only to members of the Sigler family or to Carrier Enterprise I, and, at any time from and after the date on which Carrier Enterprise I owns 85 or more of RSI s outstanding common stock, it has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from the RSI Shareholders the remaining outstanding shares of RSI common stock. At September 30, 2024, using the criteria set forth in the Shareholders Agreement, the valuation of the RSI Shareholders RSI common stock was approximately 477.0 million. On July 28, 2023, Watsco, Carrier Enterprise I, and the RSI Majority Holders entered into an agreement that (1) provides Carrier Enterprise I the discretion, but not the obligation, to fund up to 80 of any purchase from the RSI Majority Holders of their RSI common stock, as required under the Shareholders Agreement, using Watsco Common stock (the Offered Shares ), (2) provides that any Offered Shares actually issued would be valued based on the average volume-weighted average price of Watsco s Common stock for the ten trading days immediately preceding the payment date for the applicable RSI shares, and (3) limits the amount of RSI shares that may be collectively sold by the RSI Majority Holders to Carrier Enterprise I under the Shareholders Agreement to 125.0 million during any rolling 12-month period. We have not issued or sold any Offered Shares, and there is no assurance that we will issue and sell any Offered Shares, nor is the number of Offered Shares that may be issued and sold currently determinable. We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, short-term cash investments or funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement, or use of the 2024 ATM Program would be sufficient to purchase any additional ownership interests in RSI for cash pursuant to the agreement described in the preceding paragraph. Acquisitions On February 1, 2024, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired CSI, a distributor of HVAC products with annual sales of approximately 13.0 million, operating from two locations in Kentucky and Ohio. Consideration for the purchase consisted of 6.0 million in cash, 1,904 shares of Common stock having a fair value of 0.8 million, and 0.6 million for repayment of indebtedness, net of cash acquired of 1.4 million. On September 1, 2023, we acquired substantially all the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of GWS, a plumbing and HVAC distributor with annual sales of approximately 180.0 million, operating from 16 locations in South Carolina and North Carolina. Consideration for the net purchase price consisted of 4.0 million in cash, net of cash acquired of 3.1 million, and 280,215 shares of Common stock having a fair value of 101.6 million, net of a discount for lack of marketability. On March 3, 2023, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired Capitol, a distributor of plumbing and air conditioning and heating products with annual sales of approximately 13.0 million, operating from three locations in New York. Consideration for the purchase consisted of 1.2 million in cash, net of cash acquired of 0.1 million, and 1.9 million for repayment of indebtedness. We continually evaluate potential acquisitions and/or joint ventures and investments in unconsolidated entities. We routinely hold discussions with several acquisition candidates. Should suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require additional financing, we believe our financial position and earnings history provide a sufficient basis for us to either obtain additional debt financing at competitive rates and on reasonable terms or raise capital through the issuance of equity securities.

Common Stock Dividends We paid cash dividends of 7.85 and 7.35 per share on both Common and Class B common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On October 1, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 2.70 per share on both Common and Class B common stock that was paid on October 31, 2024 to shareholders of record as of October 16, 2024. Future dividends and/or changes in dividend rates are at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and depend upon factors including, but not limited to, cash flow generated by operations, profitability, financial condition, cash requirements, prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Dividend Reinvestment Plan On March 29, 2024, we implemented the Watsco, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the Plan ), under which existing shareholders may, in accordance with the Plan, acquire shares of Common stock or Class B common stock, as applicable (collectively common stock ), by reinvesting all or a portion of the cash dividends paid on such shareholders shares of common stock. The Plan has been registered under the Securities Act pursuant to our automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-260758). During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 13,394 and 13,398 shares of common stock under the Plan, respectively. Company Share Repurchase Program In September 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, at management s discretion, of up to 7,500,000 shares of common stock in the open market or via private transactions. Shares repurchased under the program are accounted for using the cost method and result in a reduction of shareholders equity. We last repurchased shares under this plan in 2008. In aggregate, 6,370,913 shares of Common and Class B common stock have been repurchased at a cost of 114.4 million since the inception of the program. At September 30, 2024, there were 1,129,087 shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the program. In considering any further stock repurchases under our repurchase program, we intend to evaluate the impact of the 1 excise tax on stock repurchases that became effective on January 1, 2023. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There have been no material changes to the information regarding market risk provided in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are, among other things, designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO ), Executive Vice President EVP ), and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and appropriate SEC filings. Our management, with the participation of our CEO, EVP and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and, based on that evaluation, our CEO, EVP and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at a reasonable assurance level, at and as of such date. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We continuously seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our internal controls. This results in refinements to processes throughout the Company. However, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
