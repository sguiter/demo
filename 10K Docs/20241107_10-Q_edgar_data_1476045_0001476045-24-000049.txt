 The Company estimates the fair value of its fixed rate debt by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at estimated market rates. All of the Company's mortgage loans are fixed-rate. Rates take into consideration general market conditions, quality and estimated value of collateral and maturity of debt with similar credit terms and are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

 The Company estimates the fair value of its variable rate debt by taking into account general market conditions and the estimated credit terms it could obtain for debt with similar maturity and is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

 The Company's mortgage debt agreements contain cash trap provisions that are triggered when the hotel s operating results fall below a certain debt service coverage ratio or debt yield. When these provisions are triggered, all of the excess cash flow generated by the hotel is deposited directly into cash management accounts for the benefit of the lenders until a specified debt service coverage ratio or debt yield is reached. Such provisions do not allow the lender the right to accelerate repayment of the underlying debt. As of September 30, 2024, of our mortgage debt lenders has enforced cash trap provisions resulting in million of restricted cash. The Company does not expect that such cash traps will affect its ability to satisfy its short-term liquidity requirements.

 Time-based LTIP unit awards will vest ratably provided that the recipient remains employed by the Company through the applicable vesting date, subject to acceleration of vesting in the event of the recipient s death, disability, termination without cause or resignation with good reason, or in the event of a change of control of the Company. Prior to vesting, a holder is entitled to receive distributions on the LTIP units that comprise the 2024 Time-Based LTIP Unit Awards and the prior year LTIP unit awards set forth in the table above. 
 
 Performance-Based LTIP Awards 
 
 On March 1, 2024, the Company's Operating Partnership, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, also granted performance-based LTIP unit awards (the "2024 Performance-Based LTIP Unit Awards"). The grants were made pursuant to award agreements that have market-based vesting conditions. The Performance-Based LTIP Unit Awards are comprised of Class A Performance LTIP Units that will vest only if and to the extent that (i) the Company achieves certain long-term market-based total shareholder return ("TSR") criteria established by the Compensation Committee and (ii) the recipient remains employed by the Company through the applicable vesting date, subject to acceleration of vesting in the event of the recipient s death, disability, termination without cause or resignation with good reason, or in the event of a change of control of the Company. Compensation expense is based on an estimated value of per 2024 Performance-Based LTIP Unit Award, which takes into account that the number of units that ultimately may vest will depend on the achievement of long-term market-based TSR criteria. The 2024 Performance-Based LTIP Unit Awards have an absolute negative TSR modifier which may reduce payout percentages if the absolute TSR over the measurement period is negative.

 Payouts at performance levels in between the hurdles will be calculated by straight-line interpolation. 
 
 The Company estimated the aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the service period determined as of the grant date under ASC 718, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures, using a Monte Carlo approach. In determining the discounted value of the LTIP units, the Company considered the inherent uncertainty that the LTIP units would never reach parity with the other common units of the Operating Partnership and thus have an economic value of zero to the grantee. Additional factors considered in estimating the value of LTIP units included discounts for illiquidity, expectations for future dividends, risk free interest rates, stock price volatility, and economic environment and market conditions.

The IHM management agreements provide for early termination at the Company s option upon sale of any IHM-managed hotel for no termination fee, with advance notice. The IHM management agreements may be terminated for cause, including the failure of the managed hotel to meet specified performance levels. Base management fees are calculated as a percentage of the hotel's gross room revenue. If certain financial thresholds are met or exceeded, an incentive management fee is calculated as of the hotel's net operating income less fixed costs, base management fees and a specified return threshold. The incentive management fee is capped at of gross hotel revenues for the applicable calculation.

 Cost reimbursements from related parties revenue represent reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of IHM. These costs relate primarily to office expenses shared with IHM. Various shared office expenses and rent are paid by the Company and allocated to IHM based on the amount of square footage occupied by each entity. As the Company records cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, the revenue and related expense has no impact on the Company s operating income or net income. Cost reimbursements are recorded based upon the occurrence of a reimbursed activity.

Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information 
 
 The following information contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements include information about possible or assumed future results of the lodging industry and our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, cash flow and plans and objectives. These statements generally are characterized by the use of the words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, plan, continue, intend, should, may, will, could or similar expressions. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, such forward-looking statements relate to future events, our plans, strategies, prospects and future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks that are difficult to predict, uncertainties and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control and which could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results are summarized below. Some factors that might cause such a difference include the following: local, national and global economic conditions, uncertainty surrounding the financial stability of the United States, Europe and China, increased direct competition, changes in government regulations or accounting rules, changes in local, national and global real estate conditions, declines in lodging industry fundamentals, increased operating costs, a potential recessionary environment, seasonality of the lodging industry, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing on satisfactory terms, changes in interest rates, our ability to identify suitable investments, our ability to close on identified investments, inaccuracies of our accounting estimates, the uncertainty and economic impact of pandemics like COVID-19, epidemics or other public health emergencies or fear of such events, the impact of and changes to various government programs, and our ability to dispose of selected hotel properties on the terms and timing we expect, if at all. Given these uncertainties, undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect future events or circumstances or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. The forward-looking statements should also be read in light of the risk factors identified in the Risk Factors section in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as updated by the Company's subsequent filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act. 

Overview 
 
 We are a self-advised hotel investment company organized in October 2009 that commenced operations in April 2010. Our investment strategy is to invest in upscale extended-stay and premium-branded select-service hotels in geographically diverse markets with high barriers to entry near strong demand generators. We may acquire portfolios of hotels or single hotels. We expect that a significant portion of our portfolio will consist of hotels in the upscale extended-stay or select-service categories, including brands such as Homewood Suites by Hilton , Residence Inn by Marriott , Hyatt Place , Courtyard by Marriott , SpringHill Suites by Marriott , Hilton Garden Inn by Hilton , Embassy Suites , Hampton Inn , Hampton Inn and Suites , Home2 Suites by Hilton and TownePlace Suites by Marriott . 
 
 The Company's future hotel acquisitions may be funded by issuances of both common and preferred shares or the issuance of partnership interests in our operating partnership, Chatham Lodging, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), draw-downs under our revolving credit facility, the incurrence or assumption of debt, available cash, or proceeds from dispositions of assets. We intend to acquire quality assets at attractive prices and improve their returns through knowledgeable asset management and seasoned, proven hotel management while remaining prudently leveraged. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our leverage ratio was 24.3 measured as the ratio of our net debt (total debt outstanding before deferred financing costs less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) to hotel investments at cost. Over the past several years, we have maintained a leverage ratio between the mid 20s and the low 50s. As of September 30, 2024, we have total debt of 438.5 million at a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 6.8 . 
 22 

We are a real estate investment trust REIT for federal income tax purposes. In order to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), we cannot operate our hotels. Therefore, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries lease our hotel properties to taxable REIT subsidiary lessees TRS Lessees ), who in turn engage eligible independent contractors to manage the hotels. Each of the TRS Lessees is treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes and is consolidated within our financial statements for accounting purposes. However, since we control both the Operating Partnership and the TRS Lessees, our principal source of funds on a consolidated basis is from the operations of our hotels. The earnings of the TRS Lessees are subject to taxation as regular C corporations, as defined in the Code, potentially reducing the TRS Lessees cash available to pay dividends to us, and therefore our funds from operations and the cash available for distribution to our shareholders. 
 
 Key Indicators of Operating Performance and Financial Condition 
 We measure financial condition and hotel operating performance by evaluating non-financial and financial metrics and measures such as: 
 
 Average Daily Rate ADR ), which is the quotient of room revenue divided by total rooms sold, 
 Occupancy, which is the quotient of total rooms sold divided by total rooms available, 
 Revenue Per Available Room RevPAR ), which is the product of occupancy and ADR, and does not include food and beverage revenue, or other operating revenue, 
 Funds From Operations FFO ), 
 Adjusted FFO, 
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), 
 EBITDA re , 
 Adjusted EBITDA, and 
 Adjusted Hotel EBITDA. 
 We evaluate the hotels in our portfolio and potential acquisitions using these metrics to determine each hotel s contribution toward providing income to our shareholders through increases in distributable cash flow and increasing long-term total returns through appreciation in the value of our common shares. RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy are hotel industry measures commonly used to evaluate operating performance. 
 
 See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further discussion of FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA.

Results of Operations 
 
 Industry Outlook 
 
 Smith Travel Research reported that U.S. lodging industry RevPAR increased 0.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, with RevPAR flat in July 2024, up 3.9 in August 2024 and down 1.3 in September 2024. We expect that over the remainder of 2024, lodging industry RevPAR will increase modestly. 
 
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include the operating activities of the hotels we owned during the period. We sold one hotel located in Denver, CO on January 9, 2024 and acquired one hotel located in Phoenix, AZ on May 30, 2024. The changes in results described below were driven primarily by the continued recovery of business travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, the sale of one hotel, the acquisition of one hotel, and inflationary cost pressures. 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Revenue, which consists primarily of room, food and beverage and other operating revenues from our hotels, was as follows for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Room 80,236 79,862 0.5 Food and beverage 1,832 1,975 (7.2) Other 4,826 4,623 4.4 Reimbursable costs from related parties 283 281 0.7 Total revenue 87,177 86,741 0.5 
 
 Total revenue was 87.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up 0.5 million compared to total revenue of 86.7 million for the corresponding 2023 period. The increase in total revenue primarily was related to the 1.3 increase in same property RevPAR. One hotel owned during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was not owned during the three months ended September 30, 2023, contributed 1.4 million of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This was offset by the decrease in revenue from the sale of one hotel that contributed 0 in room revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down 2.1 million from the 2.1 million that hotel contributed for the corresponding 2023 period. Since all of our hotels are select-service or limited-service hotels, room revenue is the primary revenue source as these hotels do not have significant food and beverage revenue or large group conference facilities. Room revenue comprised 92.0 and 92.1 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Food and beverage revenue was 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down 0.2 million compared to 2.0 million for the corresponding 2023 period. The decline in food and beverage revenue was related to the sale of one hotel. 
 
 Other operating revenue is comprised of parking, meeting room, gift shop, in-room movie and other ancillary amenities revenue. Other operating revenue was 4.8 million and 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in other operating revenue primarily was related to increases in revenue from parking. 
 
 Reimbursable costs from related parties were 0.3 million and 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cost reimbursements were offset by the reimbursed costs from related parties included in operating expenses. 
 
 24 

In the table below, we present both actual and same property room revenue metrics. Actual Occupancy, ADR and RevPAR metrics reflect the performance of the hotels for the actual days such hotels were owned by the Company during the periods presented. Same property Occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR reflect results for the hotels owned by us as of September 30, 2024 that have been in operation for a full year regardless of our ownership during the period presented, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Results for the hotels for periods prior to our ownership were provided to us by prior owners and have not been adjusted by us. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Percentage Change Same Property (38 hotels) Actual (39 hotels) Same Property (38 hotels) Actual (39 hotels) Same Property (38 hotels) Actual (39 hotels) Occupancy 79.9 79.2 79.9 79.6 0.0 (0.5) ADR 187.52 187.07 185.14 184.45 1.3 1.4 RevPAR 149.81 148.25 147.90 146.76 1.3 1.0 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 same property RevPAR increased 1.3 due to an increase in ADR of 1.3 and no change in occupancy. Same property RevPAR increased 0.2 in July 2024, increased 0.3 in August 2024, and increased 3.4 in September 2024. Same property RevPAR was 154.72 in July 2024, 143.59 in August 2024, and 151.16 in September 2024. 
 
 Hotel Operating Expenses 
 
 Hotel operating expenses consist of the following for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Hotel operating expenses: Room 17,011 17,223 (1.2) Food and beverage 1,592 1,510 5.4 Telephone 343 385 (10.9) Other hotel operating 1,188 949 25.2 General and administrative 7,506 7,503 Franchise and marketing fees 6,990 6,980 0.1 Advertising and promotions 1,677 1,538 9.0 Utilities 3,946 3,758 5.0 Repairs and maintenance 4,178 4,111 1.6 Management fees 2,959 2,994 (1.2) Insurance 851 717 18.7 Total hotel operating expenses 48,241 47,668 1.2 
 
 Hotel operating expenses increased 0.5 million, or 1.2 , to 48.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 47.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary causes of the increase in hotel operating expenses were increases in insurance costs, utilities costs, and other hotel operating expenses. 
 
 Room expenses, which are the most significant component of hotel operating expenses, decreased 0.2 million from 17.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 17.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in room expenses primarily was related to a decrease in costs for overtime, outsourced contracted labor, and travel agent commissions. 
 
 The remaining hotel operating expenses increased 0.8 million, from 30.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 31.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in other remaining expenses primarily was related to increases in insurance and utilities costs. 
 25 

Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was 15.3 million and 14.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Property Taxes, Ground Rent and Insurance 
 
 Total property taxes, ground rent and insurance expenses increased 0.5 million from 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily related to increases in property tax assessments and an increase in insurance costs. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses principally consist of employee-related costs, including base payroll, bonuses and amortization of restricted stock and awards of long-term incentive plan units. These expenses also include corporate operating costs, professional fees and trustees fees. Total general and administrative expenses (excluding amortization of stock based compensation of 1.7 million and 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively) was 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Reimbursable Costs from Related Parties 
 
 Reimbursable costs from related parties, comprised of corporate payroll and rent costs were 0.3 million and 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cost reimbursements were offset by the cost reimbursements from related parties included in revenues. 
 
 Interest and Other Income 
 
 Interest on cash and cash equivalents and other income decreased 0.4 million from 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was due to lower cash balances during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest Expense, Including Amortization of Deferred Fees 
 
 Interest expense increased 1.5 million from 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and is comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Mortgage debt interest 2,994 4,762 (37.1) Credit facility and term loan interest and unused fees 4,883 1,783 173.9 Interest on finance lease liability 6 100.0 Amortization of deferred financing costs 379 304 24.7 Total 8,262 6,849 20.6 
 
 The increase in interest expense was due to the refinancing of maturing debt which had interest rates below current levels. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 Income tax expense remained unchanged at zero for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We are subject to income taxes based on the taxable income of our TRS Lessees at a combined federal and state tax rate of approximately 25 . The Company s TRS has generated taxable losses over the last three years and recognizes a full valuation allowance equal to 100 of the gross deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the TRS's ability to utilize these deferred tax assets. 
 
 26 

Net Income 
 
 Net income was 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net income was primarily due to the factors discussed above. 

27 

Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the operating activities of the hotels we owned for the entire period. We sold one hotel located in Denver, CO on January 9, 2024 and acquired one hotel located in Phoenix, AZ on May 30, 2024. The changes in results described below were driven primarily by the continued recovery of business travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, the sale of one hotel, the acquisition of one hotel, and inflationary cost pressures. 
 
 Revenues 
 Revenue, which consists primarily of room, food and beverage and other operating revenues from our hotels, was as follows for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Room 221,762 219,019 1.3 Food and beverage 5,806 6,156 (5.7) Other 13,695 12,646 8.3 Reimbursable costs from related parties 836 1,011 (17.3) Total revenue 242,099 238,832 1.4 
 
 Total revenue was 242.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up 3.3 million compared to total revenue of 238.8 million for the corresponding 2023 period. The increase in total revenue primarily was related to the 2.1 increase in same property RevPAR, the acquisition of one hotel on May 30, 2024, partially offset by the decrease in revenue from the sale of one hotel January 9, 2024. The one hotel acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was not owned during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, contributed 1.8 million of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was partially offset by the decrease in revenue from the sale of one hotel that contributed 0.1 million in room revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down 4.9 million from the 5.0 million that hotel contributed for the corresponding 2023 period. Since all of our hotels are select-service or limited-service hotels, room revenue is the primary revenue source as these hotels do not have significant food and beverage revenue or large group conference facilities. Room revenue comprised 91.6 and 91.7 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Food and beverage revenue was 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down 0.4 million compared to food and beverage revenue of 6.2 million for the corresponding 2023 period. The decrease in food and beverage revenue was related to the sale of one hotel. 
 
 Other operating revenue, comprised of parking, meeting room, gift shop, in-room movie and other ancillary amenities revenue, increased 1.1 million to 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.6 million for the corresponding 2023 period. The increase in other operating revenue primarily was related to increases in revenue from parking. 
 
 Reimbursable costs from related parties were 0.8 million and 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cost reimbursements were offset by the reimbursed costs from related parties included in operating expenses. 
 
 In the table below, we present both actual and same property room revenue metrics. Actual Occupancy, ADR and RevPAR metrics reflect the performance of the hotels for the actual days such hotels were owned by the Company during the periods presented. Same property Occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR reflect results for the hotels we owned as of September 30, 2024 that have been in operation for a full year regardless of our ownership during the period presented, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Results for the hotels for periods prior to our ownership were provided to us by prior owners and have not been adjusted by us.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Percentage Change Same Property (38 hotels) Actual (40 hotels) Same Property (38 hotels) Actual (39 hotels) Same Property (38 hotels) Actual (40 / 39 hotels) Occupancy 77.4 77.1 76.2 75.7 1.6 1.8 ADR 180.93 180.73 180.03 179.15 0.5 0.9 RevPAR 140.08 139.35 137.16 135.68 2.1 2.7 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 same property RevPAR increased 2.1 due to an increase in ADR of 0.5 and an increase in occupancy of 1.6 primarily related to the continued recovery of business travel following the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Hotel Operating Expenses 
 Hotel operating expenses consist of the following for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Hotel operating expenses: Room 49,110 45,918 7.0 Food and beverage 4,683 4,651 0.7 Telephone 991 1,106 (10.4) Other hotel operating 3,031 2,812 7.8 General and administrative 21,903 21,616 1.3 Franchise and marketing fees 19,415 19,121 1.5 Advertising and promotions 4,604 4,513 2.0 Utilities 10,061 9,807 2.6 Repairs and maintenance 12,235 11,735 4.3 Management fees 8,118 8,073 0.6 Insurance 2,504 2,117 18.3 Total hotel operating expenses 136,655 131,469 3.9 
 
 Hotel operating expenses increased 5.2 million to 136.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 131.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in hotel operating expenses was related to the increase in revenues and occupancy caused by the continued recovery of business travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in staffing levels, wage and benefit costs, insurance costs, and inflation. The one hotel acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was not owned during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, contributed 1.2 million of operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was partially offset by the sale of one hotel during the first quarter of 2024 that contributed 0.2 million of operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down 3.2 million from the 3.4 million the sold hotel contributed during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Room expenses, which are the most significant component of hotel operating expenses, increased 3.2 million from 45.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 49.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in room expenses was related to an increase in occupancies and revenues at our hotels due to the continued recovery of business travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, increased staffing levels, wage and benefit costs, and inflation. 
 
 29 

The remaining hotel operating expenses increased 1.9 million, from 85.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 87.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in other remaining expenses primarily was related to an increase in occupancies and revenues at our hotels due to the continued recovery of business travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, increased insurance costs, and inflation. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 1.9 million from 43.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 45.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Property Taxes, Ground Rent and Insurance 
 Total property taxes, ground rent and insurance expenses decreased 0.5 million from 18.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 17.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily related to successful property tax appeals at multiple hotel properties. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses principally consist of employee-related costs, including base payroll, bonuses and amortization of restricted stock and awards of LTIP units. These expenses also include corporate operating costs, professional fees and trustees fees. Total general and administrative expenses (excluding amortization of stock-based compensation of 4.9 million and 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively) increased 0.1 million to 8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Reimbursable Costs from Related Parties 
 
 Reimbursable costs from related parties, comprised of corporate payroll and rent costs were 0.8 million and 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cost reimbursements were offset by the cost reimbursements from related parties included in revenues. 
 
 (Loss) Gain on Sale of Hotel Property 
 
 Loss on sale of hotel property was 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a gain on sale of hotel property of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The HGI Denver Tech hotel property was sold on January 9, 2024 which resulted in a loss of 0.2 million. 
 
 Interest and Other Income 
 
 Interest on cash and cash equivalents and other income increased 0.9 million from 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to higher cash 
 balances and higher interest rates received on cash balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 30 

Interest Expense, Including Amortization of Deferred Fees 
 
 Interest expense increased 3.6 million from 19.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 23.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and is comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Mortgage debt interest 13,148 14,020 (6.2) Credit facility and term loan interest and unused fees 9,092 4,399 106.7 Interest on finance lease liability 8 100.0 Interest rate cap (16) (100.0) Construction loan interest 415 (100.0) Amortization of deferred financing costs 1,044 911 14.6 Total 23,292 19,729 18.1 
 
 The increase in interest expense was due to the refinancing of maturing debt which had interest rates below current levels. 
 
 Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt 
 
 Loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased 0.7 million from 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The loss in 2023 is related to the Company's repayment of the construction loan on the Home2 Woodland Hills hotel property. 
 
 Gain from Partial Lease Termination 
 
 Gain from partial lease termination decreased 0.2 million from 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gain in 2023 is related to the Company's termination of a portion of its corporate office lease to vacate and surrender possession of 7,374 rentable square feet in exchange for an early termination payment of 0.1 million. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0 and 0, respectively. We are subject to income taxes based on the taxable income of our TRS Lessees at a combined federal and state tax rate of approximately 25 . The Company s TRS is expecting taxable losses in 2024 and recognizes a full valuation allowance equal to 100 of the gross deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the TRS's ability to utilize these deferred tax assets. 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Net income was 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 5.9 million from net income of 11.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net income was primarily due to the factors discussed above. 
 
 31 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We consider the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our operating performance: (1) FFO, (2) Adjusted FFO, (3) EBITDA, (4) EBITDA re , (5) Adjusted EBITDA and (6) Adjusted Hotel EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as prescribed by GAAP as a measure of our operating performance. 
 
 FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not represent cash generated from operating activities under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA are not measures of our liquidity, nor are FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. These measurements do not reflect cash expenditures for long-term assets and other items that have been and will be incurred. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures, property acquisitions, and other commitments and uncertainties. 
 
 We calculate FFO in accordance with standards established by Nareit, which defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment write-downs, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures following the same approach. We believe that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it measures our performance without regard to specified non-cash items such as real estate depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on sale of real estate assets and certain other items that we believe are not indicative of the property level performance of our hotel properties. We believe that these items reflect historical cost of our asset base and our acquisition and disposition activities and are less reflective of our ongoing operations, and that by adjusting to exclude the effects of these items, FFO is useful to investors in comparing our operating performance between periods and between REITs that also report FFO using the Nareit definition. 
 
 We calculate Adjusted FFO by further adjusting FFO for certain additional items that are not addressed in Nareit s definition of FFO, including other charges, losses on the early extinguishment of debt and similar items related to unconsolidated real estate entities that we believe do not represent costs related to hotel operations. We believe that Adjusted FFO provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs that make similar adjustments to FFO. 
 32 

The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO and Adjusted FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except share data): 
 For the three months ended For the nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Funds From Operations FFO ): Net income 4,339 7,499 5,889 11,822 Preferred dividends (1,987) (1,987) (5,962) (5,962) Net income (loss) attributable to common shares and common units 2,352 5,512 (73) 5,860 Loss (gain) on sale of hotel properties 14 (1) 154 (56) Depreciation of hotel properties owned 14,803 14,634 44,711 43,454 FFO attributable to common share and unit holders 17,169 20,145 44,792 49,258 Amortization of finance lease assets 430 580 Other charges 6 77 44 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 5 17 696 Gain from partial lease termination (164) Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders 17,599 20,156 45,466 49,834 Weighted average number of common shares and units Basic 50,813,521 50,437,656 50,737,772 50,352,175 Diluted 50,975,806 50,591,401 51,110,972 50,482,886 
 
 Diluted weighted average common share and unit count used for calculation of Adjusted FFO per share may differ from diluted weighted average common share count used for calculation of GAAP Net Income per share due to the inclusion of LTIP units, which may be converted to common shares of beneficial interest if Net Income per share is negative and Adjusted FFO is positive. Unvested restricted shares and unvested LTIP units that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future would not be included in the computation of diluted loss per share for the periods where a loss has been recorded because they would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented. 
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") is defined as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sales of assets; (3) depreciation and amortization; and (4) unconsolidated real estate entity items including interest, depreciation and amortization excluding gains and losses from sales of real estate. We consider EBITDA useful to an investor in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of our operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results. In addition, EBITDA is used as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions. 
 In addition to EBITDA, we present EBITDA re in accordance with Nareit guidelines, which defines EBITDA re as net income or loss excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA re provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs. 
 We also present Adjusted EBITDA, which includes additional adjustments for items such as other charges, gains or losses on extinguishment of indebtedness, the amortization of share-based compensation, and certain other expenses that we consider outside the normal course of operations. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income, EBITDA and EBITDA re , is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our performance. 

33 

The following is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 
 For the three months ended For the nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization EBITDA ): Net income 4,339 7,499 5,889 11,822 Interest expense, including amortization of deferred fees 8,262 6,849 23,292 19,729 Depreciation and amortization 15,287 14,687 45,455 43,615 EBITDA 27,888 29,035 74,636 75,166 Loss (gain) on sale of hotel properties 14 (1) 154 (56) EBITDA re

 Adjusted Hotel EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, corporate general and administrative, impairment loss, loss on early extinguishment of debt, other charges, interest and other income, losses on sales of hotel properties and income or loss from unconsolidated real estate entities. We present Adjusted Hotel EBITDA because we believe it is useful to investors in comparing our hotel operating performance between periods and comparing our Adjusted Hotel EBITDA to those of our peer companies. 
 The following is a presentation of, and a reconciliation of net income to, Adjusted Hotel EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 
 For the three months ended For the nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income 4,339 7,499 5,889 11,822 Add: Interest expense, including amortization of deferred fees 8,262 6,849 23,292 19,729 Depreciation and amortization 15,287 14,687 45,455 43,615 Corporate general and administrative 4,395 4,218 13,623 13,172 Other charges 6 77 44 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 5 17 696 Loss on sale of hotel properties 14 154 Less: Interest and other income (97) (479) (1,627) (688) Gain on sale of hotel properties (1) (56) Gain from partial lease termination (164) Adjusted Hotel EBITDA 32,200 32,784 86,880 88,170 
 
 34 

Although we present FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA because we believe they are useful to investors in comparing our operating performance between periods and between REITs that report similar measures, these measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are: 
 
 FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect funds available to make cash distributions; 
 EBITDA, EBITDA re, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; 
 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may need to be replaced in the future, and FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 
 Non-cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period using Adjusted EBITDA; 
 Adjusted FFO, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges (including acquisition transaction costs) that result from matters we consider not to be indicative of the underlying performance of our hotel properties; and 
 Other companies in our industry may calculate FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 
 In addition, FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA are not measures of our liquidity. Because of these limitations, FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDA re, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA only supplementally. Our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere are prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 Our principal sources of cash include net cash from operations, availability under our credit facility, proceeds from debt and equity issuances, and proceeds from the sale of hotel properties. Our principal uses of cash include acquisitions, capital expenditures, operating costs, corporate expenditures, interest costs, debt repayments and distributions to equity holders. 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled 28.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 56.9 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities of 60.9 million, net cash used in investing activities of 52.1 million, and net cash used in financing activities of 65.7 million. 
 
 Cash from Operations 
 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased 5.4 million to 60.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 66.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily due to higher interest expense and higher operating costs, partially offset by improving revenue from our hotels which generated same property RevPAR growth of 2.1 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

35 

Investing Activities Cash Flows 
 
 Net cash flows used in investing activities increased 30.7 million to (52.1) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (21.4) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in investing activities of (52.1) million consisted of 24.9 million related to capital improvements on our hotels, 43.7 million related to the acquisition of one hotel, and 0.7 million of payments of franchise application costs, partially offset by 17.2 million in net proceeds related to the sale of one hotel. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in investing activities of (21.4) million consisted of 21.4 million related to capital improvements on our hotels during the period. 
 
 We expect to invest approximately 11.9 million on renovations, discretionary and emergency expenditures on our existing hotels during the remainder of 2024, including improvements required under any brand PIP. 
 
 Financing Activities Cash Flows 
 
 Net cash flows used in financing activities increased 65.6 million to (65.7) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (0.1) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in financing activities of (65.7) million were comprised of the repayment of mortgage debt of 282.9 million, distributions to common share and unit holders of 10.8 million, distributions on preferred shares of 6.0 million, payments of financing costs of 1.1 million, and payments of offering costs on common shares of 0.3 million, partially offset by net borrowings on our revolving credit facility of 125.0 million, borrowings on our unsecured term loan of 50.0 million, and proceeds from the issuance of mortgage debt of 60.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in financing activities of (0.1) million were comprised of the repayment of our construction loan of 39.3 million, principal payments on mortgage debt of 116.1 million, distributions to common share and unit holders of 10.7 million, distributions on preferred shares of 6.0 million, and payments of deferred financing costs of 1.0 million, partially offset by borrowings on our unsecured term loan of 90.0 million and proceeds from the issuance of five new mortgage loans of 82.9 million. 
 
 We declared total dividends of 0.21 and 0.21 per common share and LTIP unit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We declared total dividends of 1.24218 and 1.24218 per Series A preferred share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 
 Our material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had total debt principal and interest obligations of 545.6 million with 59.3 million of principal and interest payable within the next 12 months from September 30, 2024. 30.1 million of debt principal obligations payable during the next 12 months relate to maturities of the Company's mortgage loans secured by the Homewood Suites Billerica and Hampton Inn Suites Houston Medical Center hotel properties. See Note 6, Debt to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our property loans, revolving credit facility, and unsecured term loan. 
 
 Lease payments due within the next 12 months from September 30, 2024 total 1.9 million. See Note 12, Leases to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our corporate office and ground leases. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our leverage ratio was approximately 24.3 measured as the ratio of our net debt (total debt outstanding before deferred financing costs less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) to hotel investments at cost. Over the past several years, we have maintained a leverage ratio between the mid 20s and the low 50s. At September 30, 2024, we had total debt of 438.5 million at an average interest rate of approximately 6.8 . 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 125.0 million and 0, respectively, in outstanding borrowings under our 260.0 million revolving credit facility. We had 140.0 million and 90.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our unsecured term loan at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 36 

Our revolving credit facility and term loan contain representations, warranties, covenants, terms and conditions customary for credit facilities of this type, including a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum net worth financial covenants, limitations on (i) liens, (ii) incurrence of debt, (iii) investments, (iv) distributions, and (v) mergers and asset dispositions, covenants to preserve corporate existence and comply with laws, covenants on the use of proceeds and default provisions, including defaults for non-payment, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, non-performance of covenants, cross-defaults and guarantor defaults. We were in compliance with all financial covenants at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our mortgage debt agreements contain cash trap provisions that are triggered when the hotel s operating results fall below a certain debt service coverage ratio or debt yield. When these provisions are triggered, all of the excess cash flow generated by the hotel is deposited directly into cash management accounts for the benefit of our lenders until a specified debt service coverage ratio or debt yield is reached. Such provisions do not allow the lender the right to accelerate repayment of the underlying debt. As of September 30, 2024, one of our mortgage debt lenders has enforced cash trap provisions resulting in 0.3 million of restricted cash. We do not expect that such cash traps will affect our ability to satisfy our short-term liquidity requirements. 
 
 In December 2017, we established a 50.0 million dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan (the "DRSPP") which renewed in December 2020 and renewed again in January 2024. Under the DRSPP, shareholders may purchase additional common shares by reinvesting some or all of the cash dividends received on common shares. Shareholders may also make optional cash purchases of common shares subject to certain limitations detailed in the prospectuses for the DRSPP. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 1,640 common shares under the DRSPP at a weighted-average price per share of 8.45, which generated 14 thousand of proceeds. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 4,392 common shares under the DRSPP at a weighted-average price of 9.25, which generated 41 thousand of proceeds. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately 50.0 million in common shares available for issuance under the DRSPP. 
 
 In January 2021, we established an "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "ATM Program") whereby, from time to time, we may publicly offer and sell our common shares having an aggregate maximum offering price up to 100.0 million by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), in negotiated transactions or in transactions that are deemed to be "at-the-market" offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Cantor Fitzgerald Co., Barclays Capital Inc., BMO Capital Markets Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., BTIG, LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Regions Securities LLC, Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities act as sales agents under the ATM Program. The Company did not issue any shares under the ATM Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately 77.5 million in common shares available for issuance under the ATM Program. 
 
 We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through existing cash balances and availability under our credit facility. We believe that our existing cash balances and availability under our credit facility will be adequate to fund operating obligations, pay interest on any borrowings and fund dividends in accordance with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, such as hotel property acquisitions and debt maturities or repayments through additional long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or the possible sale of existing assets. 
 
 We intend to continue to invest in hotel properties as suitable opportunities arise. We intend to finance our future investments with free cash flow, the net proceeds from additional issuances of common and preferred shares, issuances of common units in our Operating Partnership or other securities, borrowings or asset sales. The success of our acquisition strategy depends, in part, on our ability to access additional capital through other sources. There can be no assurance that we will continue to make investments in properties that meet our investment criteria. Additionally, we may choose to dispose of certain hotels as a means to provide liquidity. 
 
 We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at September 30, 2024. 

Dividend Policy 
 
 Our common share dividend policy has been to distribute, annually, approximately 100 of our annual taxable income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company declared total common share dividends of 0.21 per share and distributions on LTIP units of 0.21 per unit. We plan to pay dividends required to maintain REIT status. The amount of any dividend is determined by our Board of Trustees.

Chatham declared dividends of 1.24218 per share of 6.625 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Inflation 
 
 Operators of hotels, in general, possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation. However, competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates. Inflation may also affect our expenses and costs of capital investments by increasing, among other things, the costs of construction, labor, employee-related benefits, food, commodities and other materials, taxes, property and casualty insurance and utilities. 

Seasonality 
 
 Demand for our hotels is affected by recurring seasonal patterns. Generally, we expect that we will have lower revenue, operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenue, operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters. These general trends are, however, influenced by overall economic cycles and the geographic locations of our hotels. To the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter, due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue, we expect to utilize cash on hand or borrowings under our credit facility to pay expenses, debt service or to make distributions to our equity holders. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies, including certain critical accounting estimates, are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 
 We may be exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of maintaining floating rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan, assumption of long-term debt in connection with our acquisitions, and upon refinancing of existing debt. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we seek to borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and, in some cases, with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates. With respect to variable rate financing, we will assess interest rate risk by identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities. 
 
 The Company estimates the fair value of its fixed rate debt by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at estimated market rates. Rates take into consideration general market conditions, maturity and fair value of the underlying collateral. The estimated fair value of the Company s fixed rate debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 185.2 million and 396.0 million, respectively. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our consolidated debt was comprised of floating and fixed interest rate debt. The fair value of our fixed rate debt indicates the estimated principal amount of debt having the same debt service requirements that could have been borrowed at the date presented, at then current market interest rates. The following table provides information about the maturities of our financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (dollars in thousands): 
 
 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total/ Weighted Average Fair Value Floating rate: Debt 140,000 125,000 265,000 265,000 Average interest rate 6.90 6.92 6.91 Fixed rate: Debt 14,311 15,975 24,590 118,635 173,511 185,212 Average interest rate 4.32 4.25 7.61 7.16 6.72 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that a hypothetical 100 basis points increase in SOFR would result in additional interest of approximately 2.7 million annually. This assumes that the amount of floating rate debt outstanding on our revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan remains 265.0 million, the total balance as of September 30, 2024.
