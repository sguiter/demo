Current and future inflationary effects may continue to be impacted by, among other things, supply chain disruptions, governmental stimulus or fiscal and monetary policies, changes in interest rates, and changing demand for certain goods and services. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact that interest rates, a global or any regional recession, or higher inflation may have on our customers or suppliers. Additionally, we are unable to predict the potential effects that any future pandemic, or the continuation or escalation of global conflicts, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rising instability in the Middle East and Myanmar, and related sanctions or market disruptions, may have on our business. It remains uncertain how long any of these conditions may last or how severe any of them may become.

As of September 30, 2024, Ball s Argentinean business had net asset exposure of million, which consisted primarily of working capital and property, plant and equipment. Aluminum Cups The Ball Aluminum Cups business was launched during 2019 to serve the growing demand for innovative, sustainable beverage packaging among customers and consumers. The aluminum cups business has allowed us to use our years of experience and specialized expertise to serve an unmet need with an environmentally friendly addition to our portfolio of aluminum packages. At this time, the growth of this business has not been at the level we initially expected. As a result, the company is currently evaluating various options for this business. If the company decides to pursue a different path, it could present a risk of future impairment loss. As of September 30, 2024, the Ball Aluminum Cups business had net assets of million, which consisted primarily of working capital and property, plant and equipment. The business, which is a non-reportable operating segment, represented less than one percent of the company s total net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

New Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements Climate Disclosures In 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted final rules to require disclosures about material climate-related risks, the actual and potential impact of the risks and additional related disclosures. The final rules are currently under a stay by the SEC and the effective dates for the rules are uncertain. The company is continuing to assess the impact that the adoption of this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and expects to meet the disclosure requirements on a prospective basis when the rules become effective for Ball. Income Tax Disclosures In 2023, new guidance was issued by the FASB with the goal of providing financial statement users with more information in the income tax rate reconciliation table and regarding income taxes paid. The company is assessing the impact that the adoption of this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and expects to meet the disclosure requirements on a prospective basis in its 2025 annual report.

Contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plans were million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to million for the first nine months of 2023, and such contributions are expected to be approximately million for the full year of 2024. This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act, actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow, among other factors. In November 2023, the Trustee Board of the U.K. defined benefit pension plan entered into an agreement with an insurance company for a bulk annuity purchase, or buy-in , for its U.K. defined benefit pension plan to reduce retirement plan risk, while delivering promised benefits to plan participants. This transaction allows the company to reduce volatility by removing investment, longevity, mortality, interest rate and inflation risk upon the transfer of substantially all of the pension plan assets to the insurer in exchange for the group annuity insurance contract. At this time the company retains both the fair value of the annuity contract within plan assets and the pension benefit obligations related to these participants. The plan was frozen on April 5, 2024, and future service accruals were replaced with enhanced defined contribution benefits for the impacted employees. The company anticipates the buy-out may occur within three years of the plan freeze, which will trigger a pension settlement that will result in all plan balances, including accumulated pension components within other comprehensive income, being charged to expense as a noncash settlement charge.

First, the company enters into container sales contracts that include aluminum-based pricing terms which generally reflect the same price fluctuations under commercial purchase contracts for aluminum sheet. The terms include fixed, floating or pass through aluminum component pricing. Second, the company uses certain derivative instruments, including option and forward contracts, as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there are material differences between sales and purchase contracted pricing and volume. Interest Rate Risk - The company s objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives,

 Net gain (loss) included in AOCI, after-tax ) ) Net gain (loss) included in AOCI, after-tax, expected to be recognized in net earnings within the next 12 months ) Longest duration of forecasted cash flow hedge transactions in years In July 2024, we entered into and designated two net investment hedges against the net assets of our euro denominated operations. We utilized cross-currency interest rate swaps for which the notional amounts of million and million mature in the first quarter of 2027 and the second quarter of 2029, respectively. As we have designated each of these cross currency swaps as net investment hedges, we record changes in fair value due to fluctuations in the spot rate to accumulated other comprehensive earnings (AOCI). Gains and losses remain in AOCI until a sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective underlying net investment in the foreign entity. As of September 30, 2024, a million net loss remained in AOCI, after tax. The changes in fair value of the swaps attributable to changes other than those due to fluctuations in the spot rate are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recorded as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the hedge in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of earnings. The reduction in interest expense from these excluded components for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was million. Common Stock Price Risk The company s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable plan accounting and, accordingly, is marked to fair value using the company s closing stock price at the end of the related reporting period. The company entered into total return swaps to reduce the company s earnings exposure to these fair value fluctuations that will be outstanding through March 2025, and which have a combined notional value of million shares. Based on the current number of shares in the program, each change in the company s stock price would have an insignificant impact on pretax earnings, net of the impact of related derivatives.

 Currency contracts Interest rate and other contracts Total current derivative contracts Other current assets Currency contracts Total noncurrent derivative contracts Other noncurrent assets Liabilities: Commodity contracts Currency contracts Interest rate and other contracts Total current derivative contracts Other current liabilities Currency contracts Total noncurrent derivative contracts Other noncurrent liabilities The company uses closing spot and forward market prices as published by the London Metal Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Reuters and Bloomberg to determine the fair value of any outstanding aluminum, currency, energy, cross currency swaps and interest rate spot and forward contracts. Option contracts are valued using a Black-Scholes model with observable market inputs for aluminum, currency and interest rates. The company values each of its financial instruments either internally using a single valuation technique, from a reliable observable market source or from third-party software. The present value discounting factor is based on the comparable time period Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or 12-month LIBOR. Ball performs validations of the company s internally derived fair values reported for the company s financial instruments on a quarterly basis utilizing counterparty valuation statements. The company additionally evaluates counterparty creditworthiness and, as of September 30, 2024, has not identified any circumstances requiring the reported values of the company s financial instruments be adjusted.

On February 1, 2012, Ball Metal Beverage Container Corp. BMBCC filed suit against Crown Technology Holding, Inc. Crown in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio seeking a declaratory judgment that the CDL beverage can end made and sold by BMBCC did not infringe certain U.S. patents held by Crown. In response, Crown filed a counterclaim alleging that the CDL ends made and sold by BMBCC infringed the subject patents and seeking damages. On September 25, 2019, the District Court granted BMBCC s motion for summary judgment holding that the patents at issue were invalid due to indefiniteness. On October 20, 2019, Crown appealed this decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit CAFC ). On December 31, 2020, the CAFC in a non-precedential decision, vacated the decision of the District Court finding that the District Court had not considered an additional factor under a novel position advanced by the CAFC, and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. On August 2, 2023, the District Court again granted summary judgment to Ball finding that patent claims at issue are invalid due to invalidity under the revised analytical framework specified by the CAFC. On August 4, 2023, Crown appealed this decision to the CAFC. Briefing for this appeal concluded on February 20, 2024. Oral argument is expected to be scheduled during 2024 with a decision to follow. Based on the information available at the present time, the Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this claim including the amount of any reasonably possible loss and we intend to vigorously defend this matter.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (consolidated financial statements) and accompanying notes included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as Ball Corporation, Ball, the company, we or our in the following discussion and analysis. OVERVIEW Business Overview and Industry Trends Ball Corporation is one of the world s leading aluminum packaging suppliers. With a growth mindset and by pursuing operational excellence, we lean on our competitive strengths to reach our financial goals. We are focused on maintaining our strong financial position by listening to and partnering with our global customers, delivering operational efficiencies and an innovative product portfolio from our best-in-class manufacturing facilities and returning value to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. In the aluminum packaging industry, sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products, expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions. We sell our aluminum packaging products mainly to large, multinational beverage, personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long-term relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a significant portion of our packaging products to major companies and brands, as well as to numerous regional customers. The overall global aluminum beverage and aerosol container industries are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term. We purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers. We also have exposure to inflation, in particular the rising costs of raw materials, as well as other direct cost inputs. We mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of aluminum through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through aluminum price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments. The pass through provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact, if any, on net earnings; however, there may be timing differences of when the costs are passed through. Because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss, insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss, and our long-term relationships represent a known, stable customer base. From time to time, we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible transactions that we believe will benefit the company and our shareholders, which may include strategic acquisitions, divestitures of parts of our company or equity investments. At any time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations at various stages of development with respect to one or more possible transactions or may have entered into non-binding letters of intent. As part of any such initiatives, we may participate in processes being run by other companies or leading our own activities.

 RESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS Management s discussion and analysis for our results of operations on a consolidated and segment basis include a quantification of factors that had a material impact. Other factors that did not have a material impact, but that are significant to understand the results, are qualitatively described. On February 16, 2024, the company completed the divestiture of its aerospace business. Effective as of the first quarter of 2024, the company reports its financial performance in three reportable segments: (1) beverage packaging, North and Central America; (2) beverage packaging, Europe, Middle East and Africa (beverage packaging, EMEA) and (3) beverage packaging, South America. See Note 1 for further information on the basis of presentation. Global Economic Environment Recent data has indicated continued high inflation in the regions where we operate. Current and future inflationary effects may continue to be impacted by, among other things, supply chain disruptions, governmental stimulus or fiscal and monetary policies, changes in interest rates, and changing demand for certain goods and services. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact that interest rates, a global or any regional recession, or higher inflation may have on our customers or suppliers. Additionally, we are unable to predict the potential effects that any future pandemic, or the continuation or escalation of global conflicts, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rising instability in the Middle East and Myanmar, and related sanctions or market disruptions, may have on our business. It remains uncertain how long any of these conditions may last or how severe any of them may become. Consolidated Sales and Earnings

Sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 244 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to decreases of 232 million resulting mainly from lower aluminum prices and 70 million from lost volumes as a result of the 2023 fire at the company s Verona, Virginia extruded aluminum slug manufacturing facility, partially offset by an increase of 33 million from higher volumes. Net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 6 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to a decrease of 65 million from lower discontinued operations, net of tax and an increase in costs of 56 million from business consolidation and other activities, partially offset by increases of 55 million from lower interest expense and 49 million from the results of the reportable segments discussed below . Net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 3.49 billion compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to increases of 3.44 billion from discontinued operations, net of tax, 132 million from the results of the reportable segments discussed below, 123 million from lower interest expense and 36 million from higher interest income in corporate undistributed expenses, net, partially offset by increases in costs of 128 million from business consolidation and other activities and 82 million from incremental compensation cost from the successful sale of the aerospace business . When analyzing net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation as a percentage of net sales, it is important to note that net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation includes discontinued operations, net of tax resulting from the net sales attributable to the historical aerospace reportable segment through the date of the divestiture on February 16, 2024, that are now reported as discontinued operations. However, net sales attributable to the historical aerospace reportable segment are not included in the net sales figures in the table above.

 Cost of Sales (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization) Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, was 2,425 million and 2,512 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 7,065 million and 7,450 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts represented 79 percent and 81 percent of consolidated net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 79 percent and 81 percent of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, including lower aluminum costs of 41 million, and other items discussed in the reportable segment sections below. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, including lower aluminum costs of 269 million and lower freight costs of 53 million, and other items discussed in the reportable segment sections below. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense was 150 million and 152 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 460 million and 449 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts represented 5 percent of consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the company s larger depreciable asset base. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative was 142 million and 133 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 518 million and 409 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts represented 5 percent and 4 percent of consolidated net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 6 percent and 4 percent of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to increased compensation costs of 98 million, including incremental compensation cost from the successful sale of the aerospace business consisting of cash bonuses and stock based compensation. Business Consolidation and Other Activities Business consolidation and other activities resulted in charges of 85 million and 29 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and charges of 171 million and 43 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The amounts in 2024 and 2023 primarily included facility shutdown costs. Further details regarding business consolidation and other activities are provided in Note 6 . Interest Income Interest income was 14 million and 12 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 58 million and 23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases in interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily due to the higher amount of cash on hand in 2024 from the aerospace sale. Interest Expense Interest expense was 67 million and 122 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 228 million and 351 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense as a percentage of average borrowings decreased by approximately 50 basis points from 5.1 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 4.6 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and remained constant at 4.9 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The interest expense decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by a decrease of 29 million from a smaller amount of weighted average principal outstanding during the quarter, resulting mainly from the use of proceeds from the aerospace disposal, and a decrease of 26 million from lower weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt during the quarter. The interest expense decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was driven by a smaller amount of weighted average principal outstanding during the year, resulting mainly from the use of proceeds from the

Table of Contents 
 aerospace disposal. The company expects to carry a smaller amount of weighted average principal throughout 2024 compared to 2023, with nearly all amounts outstanding having fixed rates. See Note 15 for further details. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 18.5 and 22.3 percent, respectively, compared to 25.7 percent and 22.3 percent for the same periods in 2023. The decrease of 7.2 percentage points for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to increased tax benefits from state and local tax credits. Similar impacts may occur in future periods, but given their inherent uncertainty, the company is unable to reasonably estimate their potential future impacts. RESULTS OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS Segment Results Ball s operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and geographical areas, and its operating results are presented in the three reportable segments discussed below.

 Management Performance Measures Management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as comparable operating earnings (earnings before interest expense, taxes and business consolidation and other non-comparable items); comparable net earnings (net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation before business consolidation and other non-comparable items after tax); comparable diluted earnings per share (comparable net earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding); return on average invested capital (net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period); economic value added (EVA dollars (net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed); earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); and diluted earnings per share. In addition, management uses operating cash flows, free cash flow (cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures; and, it may be adjusted for additional items that affect comparability between periods) and adjusted free cash flow (free cash flow adjusted for payments made for income tax liabilities related to the aerospace disposition and other material dispositions) as measures to evaluate the company s liquidity. We believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria that management uses to make strategic decisions. These financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods, including business consolidation and other non-comparable items. Nonfinancial measures used in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures; environmental, health and safety statistics; production and sales volume data; asset utilization rates and measures of sustainability. References to sales volume data represent units shipped. Many of the above noted financial measurements are presented on a non-U.S. GAAP basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements included within Item 1 of this report. Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A presentation of earnings in accordance with U.S. GAAP is available in Item 1 of this report. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included within Item 1 of this report on Form 10-Q. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows and Capital Expenditures Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external borrowings. We believe that cash flows from operating activities, even in the absence of operating cash flows from the historical aerospace reportable segment, and cash provided by short-term, long-term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments, anticipated share repurchases and anticipated capital expenditures. We have limited near-term debt maturities and our senior credit facilities are in place until 2027. The following table summarizes our cash flows: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities (385) 1,127 Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities 5,181 (826) Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities (3,998) 490 Cash flows from the historical aerospace reportable segment are presented within each cash flow statement category in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures and significant operating and investing noncash items of the aerospace discontinued operation are presented in Note 4 .

 Cash flows used in operating activities were 385 million in 2024, primarily driven by working capital outflows of 630 million. On February 16, 2024, the company completed the divestiture of the aerospace business. We currently estimate a cash tax of 950 million to be recorded as a cash outflow from operations in 2024, of which 484 million has been paid as of September 30, 2024. See Note 4 for further details. In an elevated interest rate environment, payment terms with our customers and vendors become a more important element of total mix of information used to negotiate our contract terms. At September 30, 2024, days sales outstanding, net of factored receivables, was 78 days; therefore, a change of one day in days sales outstanding will impact cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities by 34 million. At September 30, 2024, days payable outstanding was 117 days; therefore, a change of one day in days payable outstanding will impact cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities by 27 million. At September 30, 2024, days inventory outstanding was 51 days; therefore, a change of one day in days inventory outstanding will impact cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities by 27 million. Cash flows provided by investing activities were 5.18 billion in 2024, primarily driven by the initial cash proceeds received at close from the sale of the aerospace business of 5.42 billion, which is subject to further customary closing adjustments. Cash flows used in financing activities were 4.00 billion in 2024, primarily driven by net repayments of long-term borrowings of 2.83 billion and repurchases of common stock of 1.06 billion. See Note 15 for further details on the company s borrowings, and additional amounts available. We have entered into several regional accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain of our accounts receivable. The programs are accounted for as true sales of the receivables, with limited recourse to Ball, and had combined limits of approximately 1.63 billion and 2.00 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. A total of 702 million and 350 million were available for sale under these programs as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The combined limit and available for sale amount as of December 31, 2023, included 160 million and 97 million, respectively, associated with receivable factoring programs included within the historical aerospace reportable segment. The company has recorded expense related to its factoring programs of 12 million and 29 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 35 million and 69 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and has presented these amounts in selling, general and administrative in its unaudited condensed consolidated statements of earnings. The company has several regional supplier finance programs with various financial institutions that act as the paying agent for certain payables of the company. The amount of obligations outstanding that the company confirmed as valid to the financial institutions under the company's programs was 432 million and 703 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our payment terms are not dependent on whether the suppliers participate in the supplier finance programs or if the suppliers decide to factor their receivables with the financial institutions; therefore, we do not believe that future changes in the availability of supplier finance programs will have a significant impact on our liquidity. Contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plans were 24 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 13 million in the same period of 2023, and such contributions are expected to be approximately 30 million for the full year of 2024. This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act, actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow, among other factors. The company expects that 2024 capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment will likely be in the range of 650 million. Approximately 167 million of capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were contractually committed as of September 30, 2024, and the company intends to return approximately 245 million to shareholders in the form of dividends for the full year 2024, inclusive of the cash dividend of 20 cents per share, payable December 16, 2024, to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2024.

 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 820 million of our cash was held outside of the U.S. In the event that we would need to utilize any of the cash held outside of the U.S. for purposes within the U.S., there are no material legal or other economic restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from any of the countries outside the U.S. where we have cash. The company believes its U.S. operating cash flows and cash on hand, as well as availability under its long-term, revolving credit facilities, uncommitted short-term credit facilities and accounts receivable factoring programs, will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the U.S. portion of our ongoing operations, scheduled principal and interest payments on U.S. debt, dividend payments, capital expenditures and other U.S. cash requirements. If non-U.S. funds are needed for our U.S. cash requirements and we are unable to provide the funds through intercompany financing arrangements, we may be required to repatriate funds from non-U.S. locations where the company has previously asserted indefinite reinvestment of funds outside the U.S. Based on its indefinite reinvestment assertion, the company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations. It is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that might become payable if these earnings were remitted to the U.S. Share Repurchases The company s share repurchases totaled 1.06 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3 million of repurchases during the same period of 2023. The repurchases were completed using cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the sale of businesses and available borrowings. The company plans to continue capital return to shareholders via an estimated 1.4 billion in share repurchases in 2024 using cash from the aerospace divestiture and operating activities. On April 24, 2024, Ball s Board of Directors approved the repurchase by the company of up to a total of 40 million shares of its common stock. This repurchase authorization replaced all previous authorizations. Debt Facilities and Refinancing Given our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until June 2027, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements. Total interest-bearing debt of 5.82 billion and 8.62 billion was outstanding at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. On February 14, 2024, Ball announced a public tender of the 1.00 billion 5.25 senior notes due July 2025 and the 750 million 4.875 senior notes due March 2026. On March 14, 2024, 811 million of the 1.00 billion 5.25 senior notes and 494 million of the 750 million 4.875 senior notes were validly tendered and accepted. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, Ball repaid at maturity the outstanding 0.875 euro denominated senior notes due in the amount of 817 million and prepaid 700 million of the Term A loan outstanding balance. The company s senior credit facilities include a 1.35 billion term loan and long-term, multi-currency revolving facilities that mature in June 2027, which provide the company with up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of 1.75 billion. At September 30, 2024, approximately 1.72 billion was available under the company s long-term, multi-currency committed revolving credit facilities. In addition to these facilities, the company had 193 million of committed short-term loans outstanding and a 25 million short-term finance lease outstanding. The company also had approximately 1.04 billion of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at September 30, 2024, of which 42 million was outstanding and due on demand. At December 31, 2023, the company had 196 million of committed short-term loans outstanding and 13 million outstanding under short-term uncommitted credit facilities. While ongoing financial and economic conditions in certain areas may raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by allocating the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party. We also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis.

 We were in compliance with the leverage ratio requirement at September 30, 2024, and for all prior periods presented, and have met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividend payments, share repurchases, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. The most restrictive of our debt covenants requires us to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined) of no greater than 5.0 times, which will change to 4.5 times as of September 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the company could borrow an additional 2.39 billion under its long-term multi-currency committed revolving facilities and short-term uncommitted credit facilities. Additional details about our debt are available in Note 15 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 1 of this report. In July 2024, we entered into and designated two net investment hedges against the net assets of our euro denominated operations. See Note 20 for further details. Argentina See Note 1 for information relevant to economic and other government policies that may have an impact on the financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of the company s Argentina operations. Aluminum Cups See Note 1 for considerations regarding the Ball Aluminum Cups business as the company assesses options for how to best position the business for future success. Defined Benefit Pension Plans In November 2023, the Trustee Board of the U.K. defined benefit pension plan entered into an agreement with an insurance company for a bulk annuity purchase, or buy-in, for its U.K. defined benefit pension plan to reduce retirement plan risk, while delivering promised benefits to plan participants. The plan was frozen on April 5, 2024. See Note 17 for further details. CONTINGENCIES, INDEMNIFICATIONS AND GUARANTEES Details of the company s contingencies, legal proceedings, indemnifications and guarantees are available in Note 21 and Note 22 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 1 of this report. The company is routinely subject to litigation incidental to operating its businesses and has been designated by various federal, state, and international environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the clean-up of several hazardous waste sites. The company believes the matters identified will not have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity, results of operations or financial condition. Guaranteed Securities The company s senior notes are guaranteed on a full and unconditional, joint and several basis by the issuer of the company s senior notes and the subsidiaries that guarantee the notes (the obligor group). The entities that comprise the obligor group are 100 percent owned by the company. As described in the supplemental indentures governing the company s existing senior notes, the senior notes are guaranteed by any of the company s domestic subsidiaries that guarantee any other indebtedness of the company. The following summarized financial information relates to the obligor group as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Intercompany transactions, equity investments and other intercompany activity between obligor group subsidiaries have been eliminated from the summarized financial information. Investments in subsidiaries not forming part of the obligor group have also been eliminated. The results and balance sheet information of the historical aerospace reportable segment are included in the following summarized financial information of the obligor group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, as the guarantees of the aerospace business legal entities were in effect through that date. On February 16, 2024, the company completed the divestiture of the aerospace business. As such, the following summarized financial information of the obligor group as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, does not include results and balance sheet information of the historical aerospace reportable segment.

A description of the terms and conditions of the company s debt guarantees is located in Note 22 of Item 1 of this report. Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company employs established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce the company s commercial risk exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, net investments in foreign operations and prices of the company s common stock with regard to common share repurchases and the company s deferred compensation stock plan. However, there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful. Although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements. The company monitors counterparty credit risk, including lenders, on a regular basis, but Ball cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective. Additionally, in the event of default under the company s master derivative agreements, the non-defaulting party has the option to set off any amounts owed with regard to open derivative positions. Further details are available in Item 7A within Ball s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 20, 2024, and in Note 20 accompanying the consolidated financial statements included within Item 1 of this report. Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer participated in management s evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as of the end of the period covered by this report and concluded that our controls and procedures were effective. There were no changes to internal controls during the company s third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 (c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the agreement contained in this Section 11.4 is an integral part of the Transactions and that, without this agreement, Seller would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Purchaser fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 11.4 , and, in order to obtain such payment, Seller commences a Proceeding against Purchaser for the Purchaser Termination Fee, Purchaser shall pay to Seller its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such Proceeding, together with interest on the amount of the Purchaser Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal).
 (d) Except for Seller s right of specific performance to the extent permitted by Section 12.10 , (x) Seller s right to receive the Purchaser Termination Fee when payable pursuant to Section 11.4(a) , together with any related costs, expenses and interest payable pursuant to Section 11.4(c) , shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedies of Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives against Purchaser or any of its former, current and future Affiliates, their respective Representatives, and the respective successors and assigns of the foregoing Persons, in respect of this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or the Transactions, including for any Proceeding, Liabilities and Losses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) suffered or incurred by Seller arising out of this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or the Transactions, including the termination of this agreement or any breach of this Agreement by Purchaser), Seller shall not bring nor permit any of its Controlled Affiliates or their respective Representatives, or any successor or assign of any of the foregoing Persons, to bring any Proceeding against Purchaser or any of its former, current and future Affiliates, their respective Representatives, and the respective successors and assigns of the foregoing Persons seeking such Liabilities or Losses suffered or incurred as a result of or under, or otherwise relating to or arising out of, this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or the Transactions, including the termination of this agreement or any breach of this Agreement by Purchaser and (y) upon the payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee, together with any related costs, expenses and interest payable pursuant to Section 11.4(c) , none of Purchaser or any of its former, current and future Affiliates, their respective Representatives, and the respective successors and assigns of the foregoing Persons, shall have any further Liability or other obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or the Transactions; provided , that Purchaser 

shall remain obligated with respect to the Non-Disclosure Agreement, pursuant to Section 12.1 and pursuant to Section 6.10 (with respect to the confidentiality, reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Purchaser therein). Purchaser s former, current and future Affiliates, their respective Representatives, and the respective successors and assigns of the foregoing Persons are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 11.4(d) .
 (e) The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) in no event shall Purchaser be required to pay the Purchaser Termination Fee on more than one occasion and (ii) any payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee is not a penalty but is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Seller in the circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

their respective successors and assigns of the foregoing, in each case in their capacity as such (each, a Seller Releasing Party ), acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, any and all rights, claims, demands, obligations, liabilities, defenses, setoffs, counterclaims, actions and causes of action whatsoever (in each case, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, known or unknown, or due or to become due, express or implied, in law or in equity, or based on contract, tort or otherwise) it has, had, may have or may have had against Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies), or any of its or their respective past, present and future Representatives or other representatives, and all successors, assigns, executors and heirs of the foregoing, in each case in their capacity as such (each, a Purchaser Releasee ), now or in the future, in case of each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), to the extent relating to, arising out of or in connection with Seller and its Controlled Affiliates ownership or operation of, or involvement with, in each case in respect of periods at or prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies or the Business (collectively, the Released Matters ), whether arising under, or based upon, any Legal Requirement (including common law) or otherwise (including any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages or any other recourse or remedy, including as may arise under common law) are, in each case, hereby knowingly, voluntarily, irrevocably and unconditionally waived, released, discharged and relinquished; provided , however , that nothing contained in this Section 12.12 or otherwise shall limit in any respect the rights of any of Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Agreements or any such other schedule, annex, exhibit, Seller Disclosure Schedule, certificate or other document or agreement entered into, made, delivered or made available in connection herewith or entered into after the Closing. Furthermore, without limiting the generality of this Section 12.12 , from and after the Closing, no demand, claim or cause of action will be brought or maintained by, or on behalf of, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) against any Seller Releasee, or Seller or any of its Affiliates against any Purchaser Releasee, and no recourse will be sought or granted against any of them, by virtue of, or based upon, the Released Matters; provided , however , that nothing contained in this Section 12.12 or otherwise shall limit in any respect the rights of any of Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Agreements or any such other schedule, annex, exhibit, Seller Disclosure Schedule, certificate or other document or agreement entered into, made, delivered or made available in connection herewith or entered into after the Closing. Purchaser acknowledges, for itself and on behalf of the other Purchaser Releasing Parties, and Seller acknowledges, for itself and on behalf of the other Seller Releasing Parties, that the Legal Requirements of certain states provide substantially the following: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. Purchaser acknowledges, for itself and on behalf of the other Purchaser Releasing Parties, and Seller acknowledges, for itself and on behalf of the other Seller Releasing Parties, that such Legal Requirements are designed to protect a Person from waiving claims which it does not know exist or may exist. Nonetheless, Purchaser knowingly and irrevocably acknowledges and agrees, for itself and on behalf of the other Purchaser Releasing Parties, that, from and after the Closing, Purchaser and the other Purchaser Releasing Parties shall be deemed to waive their rights under any such Legal Requirements as and to the extent set forth 

in this Section 12.12(a) , and Seller knowingly and irrevocably acknowledges and agrees, for itself and on behalf of the other Seller Releasing Parties, that, from and after the Closing, Seller and the other Seller Releasing Parties shall be deemed to waive their rights under any such Legal Requirements as and to the extent set forth in this Section 12.12(a) ; provided , however , that nothing contained in this Section 12.12 or otherwise shall limit in any respect the rights of any of Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Agreements or any such other schedule, annex, exhibit, Seller Disclosure Schedule, certificate or other document or agreement entered into, made, delivered or made available in connection herewith or entered into after the Closing.
 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (except Section 12.21 ), Purchaser and Seller each acknowledges and agrees that no recourse under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement shall be had against any Seller Releasee (other than Seller) or any Purchaser Releasee (other than Purchaser), as applicable, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Legal Requirement, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Seller Releasee (other than Seller) for any obligation of Seller under this Agreement or any documents or instructions delivered in connection with this Agreement or by any Purchaser Releasee (other than Purchaser) for any obligation of Purchaser under this Agreement or any documents or instructions delivered in connection with this Agreement, as applicable, for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. 
 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller, for itself and on behalf of its Controlled Affiliates, and its and their respective Representatives, hereby waives any rights, claims, demands, obligations, liabilities, defenses, setoffs, counterclaims, actions and causes of action against any Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing, in each case, in respect of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or in equity, and Seller, for itself and on behalf of its Controlled Affiliates, and its and their respective Representatives, agrees not to commence any Proceeding against any Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing, in each case, in respect of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or in equity. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, Seller, for itself and on behalf of its Controlled Affiliates, and its and their respective Representatives, hereby acknowledges and agrees that no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability for any claims or damages to Seller or its Controlled Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 12.12(c) shall limit, impair or otherwise modify (i) the rights of any of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter (including Purchaser or its Affiliates party to the Debt Commitment Letter and their respective successors and assigns) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof or (ii) any liability or obligation of any of the Debt Financing Sources, or any of the rights of Purchaser or its Affiliates under any of the definitive documentation with respect to the Debt Financing.

 12.16 Provision Regarding Legal Representation . It is acknowledged by each party that Seller has retained Skadden and Axinn to act as its counsel in connection with the Transactions 

and that neither Skadden nor Axinn has acted as counsel for any other party in connection with such Transactions. The parties agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closings between Seller or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser, any Acquired Company or their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, Skadden or Axinn (or both) may represent Seller and its Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of Seller and its Affiliates may be directly adverse to Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates, and even though Skadden or Axinn may have represented any of the Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates in a matter substantially related to such dispute prior to the Closing or may be handling ongoing matters for Purchaser, any Acquired Compa ny or any of their respective Affiliates . Purchaser further agrees that all communications among Seller, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Affiliates (in the case of the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates, solely prior to the Closing), on the one hand, and their counsel, including in-house counsel, Skadden and Axinn, on the other hand, that relate in any way to the Transactions shall be deemed attorney-client privileged communications (collectively, the Privileged Communications and the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and may be controlled by Seller and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser, any Acquired Company or any of their Affiliates. The Privileged Communications are (and upon the Closing shall remain) the property of Seller. As to any such Privileged Communications made prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser, together with its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies), successors and assigns, further agrees that no such party may access, obtain, use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications for any purpose without a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, which waiver shall be in Seller s sole discretion. The Privileged Communications may be used by Seller in connection with any dispute that relates in any way to the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser, any Acquired Company or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any other Person or Persons (other than a party to this Agreement or any of its respective Affiliates), on the other hand, after the Closing, such Acquired Company and its Affiliates may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of the Privileged Communications to such Person or Persons; provided, however, that none of the Acquired Companies nor their Affiliates may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of Seller. 12.17 No Other Duties . The only duties and obligations of the parties under this Agreement are as specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no other duties or obligations shall be implied in fact, Legal Requirement or equity, or under any principle of fiduciary obligation.
 12.18 Reliance on Counsel and Other Advisors . Each party has consulted such legal, financial, technical or other experts as it deems necessary or desirable before entering into this Agreement.

 12.21 Purchaser Guarantor . 
 (a) To induce Seller to enter into this Agreement, Purchaser Guarantor, intending to be legally bound, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Seller, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the due and punctual payment of the Purchase Price by Purchaser (or any Purchaser Designee) under Article II of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with and solely if, as and when required by the terms of this Agreement (the Obligations ). Purchaser Guarantor agrees that its Obligations under this Section 12.21 are irrevocable, continuing, absolute and unconditional and shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by, and Purchaser Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses to enforcement it may have (now or in the future) by reason of (i) any illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any Obligation or this Agreement or any related agreement or instrument, or any Legal Requirement or Order of any jurisdiction or any other event affecting any term of the Obligations; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment or performance of, or in any other term of the Obligations, or any rescission, waiver, release, assignment, amendment or other modification of this Agreement except to the extent Seller has consented thereto; (iii) any taking, exchange, substitution, release, impairment, amendment, waiver, modification or non-perfection of any collateral or any other guaranty for the Obligations, or any manner of sale, disposition or application of proceeds of any collateral or other assets to all or part of the Obligations; (iv) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations; (v) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure, ownership or existence of Purchaser Guarantor or Purchaser (or any Purchaser Designee) or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Purchaser (or any Purchaser Designee) or its (or their) assets or any resulting restructuring, release or discharge of any Obligations; (vi) the failure of Seller to assert any claim or demand or to exercise or enforce any right or remedy under the provisions of this Agreement or otherwise; or (vii) the existence of any claim, set-off, counterclaim, recoupment 

or other rights that Purchaser Guarantor or Purchaser (or any Purchaser Designee) may have against Seller (other than a defense of payment or performance); provided , however , that, notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.21 to the contrary, Purchaser Guarantor does not waive any defenses to the payment of the Obligations that are available to Purchaser under the express terms of this Agreement.
 (b) Purchaser Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to Seller as follows:
 (1) Purchaser Guarantor is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Legal Requirements of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. 
 (2) Purchaser Guarantor has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement to which it is a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and under each other Transaction Agreement to which it is a party and to consummate the Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement to which it is a party. The execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser Guarantor of this Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement to which it is a party and the consummation of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Purchaser Guarantor and such authorization has not been subsequently modified or rescinded.
 (3) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Purchaser Guarantor and constitutes, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller, a valid and binding legal obligation of Purchaser Guarantor, enforceable against Purchaser Guarantor in accordance with the terms hereof. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of each other Transaction Agreement to which Purchaser Guarantor is a party by the other parties thereto, each such Transaction Agreement will constitute a valid and binding legal obligation of Purchaser Guarantor, enforceable against Purchaser Guarantor in accordance with the terms thereof.
 (4) The execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser Guarantor of this Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement to which Purchaser Guarantor is a party and the consummation of the Transactions does not conflict with, violate or result in a breach of any Contract, Legal Requirement or Order applicable to Purchaser Guarantor, except for such conflicts, violations or breaches that would not materially adversely affect or delay the ability of Purchaser Guarantor to pay the Obligations. 
 (c) Purchaser Guarantor further acknowledges and agrees as follows:
 (1) Purchaser Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Section 12.21 and acknowledges that this Section 12.21 is continuing in nature and applies to all presently existing and future Obligations, until the complete, irrevocable and indefeasible payment and satisfaction in full of the Obligations or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1 .
 (2) This Section 12.21 is a direct guaranty and independent of the obligations of Purchaser (or any Purchaser Designee) under this Agreement. Seller may 

resort to Purchaser Guarantor for payment and performance of the Obligations whether or not Seller shall have proceeded against Purchaser (or any Purchaser Designee) with respect to the Obligations. Seller may, at Seller s option, proceed against Purchaser Guarantor and Purchaser (or any Purchaser Designee), jointly and severally, or against Purchaser Guarantor only without having obtained a judgment against Purchaser (or any Purchaser Designee).
 (3) Purchaser Guarantor agrees that its guaranty hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time all or part of any payment of any Obligation is voided, rescinded or recovered or must otherwise be returned by Seller upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Purchaser (or any Purchaser Designee).
 (d) Purchaser Guarantor waives and shall not exercise any rights that it may acquire by way of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement or indemnification for payments made under this Section 12.21 until all Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid and discharged in full. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser Guarantor shall not be deemed to be a party to this Agreement for purposes of any provisions other than this Section 12.21 .

 In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a shareholder s notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders; provided , however , that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public disclosure of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder s notice as described above. To be in proper written form, a shareholder s notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director and as to the shareholder giving the notice and any Shareholder Associated Person (as defined below) (i) the name, age, business address, residence address and record address of such person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person, (iv) any information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (v) the nominee holder for, and number of, shares owned beneficially but not of record by such person, (vi) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options or borrowed or loaned shares) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such person with respect to any share of stock of the corporation, (vii) to the extent known by the shareholder giving the notice, the name and address of any other shareholder supporting the nominee for election or reelection as a director on the date of such shareholder s notice, (viii) a description of 

Exhibit 3(ii)

Any information required by this paragraph shall be supplemented by the shareholder giving the notice not later than ten (10) days after the record date for the meeting as of the record date. Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director for a full term if elected. The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee. Additionally, without limiting the other provisions and requirements of this Section D, unless otherwise required by law, if any shareholder (i) provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b) under the Exchange Act, and (ii) subsequently fails to comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(2) and Rule 14a-19(a)(3) under the Exchange Act, then the corporation shall disregard any proxies or votes solicited for such shareholder s nominees. Upon request by the corporation, if any shareholder provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b) under the Exchange Act, such shareholder shall deliver to the corporation, no later than five business days prior to the applicable meeting, reasonable evidence that it has met the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(3) under the Exchange Act. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section D (including the provision of the information required pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph). If the Chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall be disregarded.

In no event shall the public disclosure of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder s notice as described above. To be in proper written form, a shareholder s notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting and as to the shareholder giving the notice and any Shareholder Associated Person, (i) the name and record address of such person, (ii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person, (iii) the nominee holder for, and number of, shares owned beneficially but not of record by such person, (iv) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options or borrowed or loaned shares) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such person with respect to any share of stock of the corporation, (v) to the extent known by the shareholder giving the notice, the name and address of any other shareholder supporting the proposal of business on the date of such shareholder s notice, (vi) a description of all arrangements or understandings between or among such persons in connection with the proposal of such business by such shareholder and any material interest in such business and (vii) a representation that the shareholder giving the notice intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting.

Exhibit 3(ii)

 Section C. Director Resignation Policy. 
 In an uncontested election of directors of the corporation, any nominee who receives a greater number of votes withheld from his or her election than votes for his or her election will, within ten (10) days following the certification of the shareholder vote, tender his or her written resignation to the chairman of the board for consideration by the Nominating/Corporate 

Exhibit 3(ii) 
 Governance Committee (the Committee ). As used in this Section C, an uncontested election of directors of the corporation is an election in which the only nominees are persons nominated by the board of directors of the corporation. The Committee will consider such tendered resignation and, within sixty (60) days following the certification of the shareholder vote, will make a recommendation to the board of directors concerning the acceptance or rejection of such resignation. In determining its recommendation to the board, the Committee will consider all factors deemed relevant by the members of the Committee. The Committee also will consider a range of possible alternatives concerning the director s tendered resignation as the members of the Committee deem appropriate, including, without limitation, acceptance of the resignation, rejection of the resignation or rejection of the resignation coupled with a commitment to seek to address and cure the underlying reasons reasonably believed by the Committee to have substantially resulted in the withheld votes. The board of directors of the corporation will take formal action on the Committee s recommendation no later than ninety-five (95) days following the certification of the shareholder vote. In considering the Committee s recommendation, the board will consider the information, factors and alternatives considered by the Committee and such additional information, factors and alternatives as the board deems relevant. Following the board s decision on the Committee s recommendation, the corporation, within four (4) business days after such decision is made, will publicly disclose, in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the board s decision, together with an explanation of the process by which the decision was made and, if applicable, the board s reason or reasons for its decision. No director who, in accordance with this Section C, is required to tender his or her resignation, shall participate in the Committee s deliberations or recommendation, or in the board s deliberations or determination, with respect to accepting or rejecting his or her resignation as a director. If a majority of the members of the Committee received a greater number of votes withheld from their election than votes for their election, then the independent directors then serving on the board of directors who received a greater number of votes for their election than votes withheld from their election, and the directors, if any, who were not standing for election, will appoint an ad hoc board committee from among themselves (the Ad Hoc Committee ), consisting of such number of directors as they may determine to be appropriate, solely for the purpose of considering and making a recommendation to the board with respect to the tendered resignations. The Ad Hoc Committee shall serve in place of the Committee and perform the Committee s duties for purposes of this Section C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Ad Hoc Committee would have been created but fewer than three directors would be eligible to serve on it, the entire board of directors (other than the director whose resignation is being considered) will make the determination to accept or reject the tendered resignation without any recommendation from the Committee and without the creation of an Ad Hoc Committee. 

Exhibit 3(ii) 
 This director resignation policy set forth in this Section C, as it may from time to time be amended, will be summarized or included in the corporation s proxy statement for each meeting of shareholders (annual or special) at which directors are to be elected.

 (1) Temporary and standing committees, including an executive committee, and the respective chairmen thereof, may be appointed by the board of directors, from time to time. The board of directors may invest such committees with such powers and limit the authority of such committees as it may see fit, subject to conditions as it may prescribe. The executive committee shall consist of three or more members of the board. All other committees shall consist of one or more members of the board. All committees so appointed shall keep regular minutes of the transactions of their meetings, shall cause them to be recorded in books kept for that purpose in the office of the corporation, and shall report the same to the board of directors at its next meeting.

 (2) The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent is not, of itself, determinative that the director or officer did not meet the standard of conduct set forth in the IBCL.
 (3) To the extent that a director or officer has been wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he was a party, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, because he is or was a director or officer of the corporation, the corporation shall indemnify the director or officer against reasonable expenses incurred by him in connection therewith regardless of whether the director or officer has met the standards set forth in the IBCL and without any action or determination under Section D of this Article Five.

Exhibit 3(ii) 
 Section B. Advancement of Expenses. 
 (1) The corporation shall pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director or officer who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition of the proceeding if:
 (a) The director or officer furnishes the corporation a written affirmation of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct set forth in the IBCL;
 (b) The director or officer furnishes the corporation a written undertaking, executed personally or on his behalf, to repay any advances if it is ultimately determined that he is not entitled to indemnification under this Article Five; and
 (c) A determination is made that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification under the IBCL.
 (2) The undertaking required by paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this Section B must be an unlimited general obligation of the director or officer but need not be secured and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.
 Section C. Limitations on Indemnification. 
 (1) The corporation shall not indemnify a director or officer under Section A of this Article Five unless a determination has been made in the specific case that indemnification of the director is permissible in the circumstances because he has met the standard of conduct set forth in the IBCL. Such determination shall be made within sixty (60) days of the request for indemnification: 
 (a) By the board of directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;
 (b) If a quorum cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection, by majority vote of a committee duly designated by the board of directors (in which designation directors who are parties may participate), consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;
 (c) By special legal counsel:
 (i) Selected by the board of directors or its committee in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection; or
 (ii) If a quorum of the board of directors cannot be obtained under paragraph (a) of this subsection and a committee cannot be designated under paragraph (b) of this subsection, selected by majority vote of the full board of directors (in which selection directors who are parties may participate); or
 (d) By the shareholders, but the shares owned by or voted under the control of the officers and directors who are at the time parties to the proceeding may not be voted on the 

Exhibit 3(ii) 
 determination; provided, however, that following a change of control of the corporation, with respect to all matters thereafter arising out of acts, omissions or events prior to the change of control of the corporation concerning the rights of any person seeking indemnification under this Article Five, such determination shall be made by special legal counsel selected by such person and approved by the board of directors or its committee in the manner described in Section C(1)(c) above (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), which counsel has not otherwise performed services (other than in connection with similar matters) within the five (5) years preceding its engagement to render such opinion for such person or for the corporation or any affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) of the corporation (whether or not they were affiliates when services were so performed) Independent Counsel ). Unless such person has theretofore selected Independent Counsel pursuant to this Section C and such Independent Counsel has been approved by the corporation, legal counsel approved by a resolution or resolutions of the board of directors of the corporation prior to a change of control of the corporation shall be deemed to have been approved by the corporation as required. Such Independent Counsel shall determine as promptly as practicable whether and to what extent such person would be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law and shall render its written opinion to the corporation and such person to such effect. In making a determination under this Section C, the special legal counsel and Independent Counsel referred to above shall determine that indemnification is permissible unless clearly precluded by this Article Five or the applicable provisions of the IBCL. The corporation agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the Independent Counsel referred to above and to fully indemnify such Independent Counsel against any and all expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Article Five or its engagement pursuant hereto. 
 (2) Authorization of indemnification or an obligation to indemnify and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made as set forth in paragraph (a) above, except that if the determination is made by special legal counsel (pursuant to Section C(1)(c) above), authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made by those entitled under Section C(1)(c) above to select counsel.
 (3) Indemnification under this Article Five in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation shall be limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding.
 Section D. Enforceability. The provisions of this Article Five shall be applicable to all proceedings commenced after its adoption, whether such arise out of events, acts, omissions or circumstances which occurred or existed prior or subsequent to such adoption, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person. This Article Five shall be deemed to grant each person who is entitled to indemnification hereunder rights against the corporation to enforce the provisions of this Article Five, and any repeal or other modification of this Article Five or any repeal or modification of the IBCL or any other applicable law shall not limit any rights of indemnification then existing or arising out of events, acts, omissions, circumstances occurring or existing prior to such repeal or modification, including, without limitation, the right to indemnification for proceedings commenced after such repeal or modification to enforce this Article Five with regard to acts, omissions, events or circumstances occurring or existing prior to such repeal or modification. 

Exhibit 3(ii) 
 Section E. Severability. If this Article Five or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director or officer of the corporation as to liabilities incurred in connection with any proceeding, including an action by or in the right of the corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article Five that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by the Articles and by applicable law.

Exhibit 99 SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Reform Act), Ball is hereby filing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause Ball s actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Ball. Forward-looking statements may be made in several different contexts; for example, in the company s Form 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), quarterly and annual earnings news releases, quarterly earnings conference calls hosted by the company, public presentations at investor and credit conferences, the company s Annual Report and in other periodic communications with investors. As time passes, the relevance and accuracy of forward-looking statements may change; however, except as required by law, the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You are advised to consult any further disclosures and cautionary statements Ball makes on related subjects in our Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports and other filings with the SEC. The Reform Act defines forward-looking statements as statements that express or imply an expectation or belief and contain a projection, plan or assumption with regard to, among other things, future revenues, income, earnings per share, cash flow or capital structure. Words such as expects, anticipates, estimates, believes, targets, likely, foresees , positions and similar expressions typically identify forward-looking statements, which are generally any statements other than statements of historical fact. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and you should therefore not place undue reliance upon such statements. Rather, these statements involve estimates, assumptions uncertainties and known and unknown risks, many of which are outside our control, and such statements are therefore qualified in their entirety by reference to the following important factors, among others (including those described in any Risk Factors section of our most current Form 10-K, 10-Q or other filings with the SEC), that could cause Ball s actual results or performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Ball: Fluctuation in customer and consumer growth, spending, demand or preferences, and changes in consumption patterns, both on a seasonal basis and those that may be longer-term or structural in nature, including any effect on demand for our products as a result of the enactment of laws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption or altering the package or portion size of certain of our customers products. Customer, competitor or supplier consolidation and potential correspondent supply chain influence.
