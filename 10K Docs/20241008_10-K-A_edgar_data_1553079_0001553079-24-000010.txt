 EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A (this amended Annual Report amends the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the Original Form 10-K ), filed by Empire State Realty OP, L.P. our Company, we, us, our, and the Operating Partnership with the SEC on February 28, 2024. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references herein to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, this Form 10-K, this Annual Report and similar names refer to the Original Form 10-K, as amended by this amended Annual Report. 
 This amended Annual Report is limited in scope to the portions of this amended Annual Report set forth above. This amended Annual Report does not modify, amend, or update in any way any other items or disclosures contained in the Original Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements set forth in the Original Form 10-K or XBRL data filed in Exhibit 101. 
 Except as noted herein, this amended Annual Report has not been updated for other events or information subsequent to the date of the filing of the Original Form 10-K, and should be read in conjunction with the Original Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. 
 Material Weakness 
 In August 2024, EY, our independent registered public accounting firm, informed us that following EY s internal post audit quality review of its audit of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, EY had identified control deficiencies in the design of certain information technology IT general controls ITGCs for our information systems and applications which were relevant to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023. In particular, the Company s ITGCs included: (i) controls to approve and monitor changes within information systems and related applications, but the monitoring controls were not designed to ensure a complete population of changes were subject to the control procedures across all relevant IT components, and (ii) controls to approve and monitor user access to information systems and related applications, but the monitoring controls were not designed to review the appropriateness of permissions granted to approved users. As a result, business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the ineffective ITGCs, or that rely on data produced from systems impacted by the ineffective ITGCs, were also deemed ineffective. In consideration of this, management, after discussion with EY, concluded there was a material 

weakness resulting from those ITGCs as the compensating business process controls in place to mitigate this control deficiency were impacted by the ineffective ITGCs. As a result, we reevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and ESRT's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls were not effective at a reasonable level of assurance for the periods presented in the Original Form 10-K because of the material weakness. 
 Despite the finding of the material weakness, we have concluded that our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in our Original Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in the Original Form 10-K. Such financial statements are reincluded in this amended Annual Report for purposes of EY's opinions, but have not been amended or restated in any way since the Original Form 10-K. 
 Management s Remediation Efforts 
 We are in the process of implementing changes associated with the design, implementation and monitoring of ITGCs in the areas of logical access and change management for IT applications that support our financial statement preparation and reporting processes to ensure that internal controls are designed and operating effectively. Our remediation plans will include: 
 Enhancing the current change monitoring control to use an appropriate system source to help ensure a complete population of changes are reviewed to detect if any changes were made outside the Company s established change control process across all relevant IT components. 
 Adding controls to manage the appropriate assignment and maintenance of permission configurations within access groups and the users they are assigned to. 
 Increasing the frequency of periodic re-evaluation of user access privileges. 
 Training of relevant personnel on the design and operation of our ITGCs over financial reporting. 
 We believe that these actions, collectively, will remediate the material weakness identified. However, we will not be able to conclude that we have completely remediated the material weakness until the applicable controls are fully implemented and operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through formal testing, that the remediated controls are operating effectively. We will continue to monitor the design and effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures, and controls and will make any further changes management deems appropriate.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Prior to the filing of the Original Form 10-K, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including ESRT's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. At the time that the Company filed the Original Form 10-K, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 As discussed in the Explanatory Note to this amended Annual Report, subsequent to the filing of the Original Form 10-K, we reevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and ESRT's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls were not effective at a reasonable level of assurance for the periods presented in the Original Form 10-K because of the material weakness described in "Management's report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting" below. 
 Despite the finding of the material weakness, we have concluded that our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in our Original Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in the Original Form 10-K. Such financial statements are reincluded in this amended Annual Report for purposes of Ernst and Young LLP s ("EY") opinions, but have not been amended or restated in any way since the Original Form 10-K. 
 Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 
 Management, including ESRT's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions. 
 (a) Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Prior to the filing of the Original Form 10-K, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including ESRT's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we 
 2 

conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 as required by Rule 13(a)-15(f) under the Exchange Act. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria ). A material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 In Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included in the Original Form 10-K, management, including ESRT's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. As discussed in the Explanatory Note to this amended Annual Report, subsequent to the filing of the Original Form 10-K, we reevaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, and management has now concluded that a material weakness in the design of ITGCs related to IT systems and applications relevant to preparation of our financial statements existed as of December 31, 2023 for the periods presented in the Original Form 10-K, and thus our disclosure controls were not effective at a reasonable level of assurance for the periods presented in the Original Form 10-K. Accordingly, management has restated its report on internal control over financial reporting. 
 Despite the finding of the material weakness, management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Original Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this report. Additional detail on the nature of the material weakness, and management s conclusions can be found below. 
 Design of Information Technology General Controls 
 We identified a material weakness in the design of ITGCs related to IT systems and applications relevant to preparation of our financial statements. In particular, the Company's ITGCs included: (i) controls to approve and monitor changes within information systems and related applications, but the monitoring controls were not designed to ensure a complete population of changes were subject to the control procedures across all relevant IT components and (ii) the controls to approve and monitor user access to information systems and related applications, but the monitoring controls were not designed to review the appropriateness of permissions granted to approved users. As a result, business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the ineffective ITGCs, or that rely on data produced from systems impacted by the ineffective ITGCs, were also deemed ineffective. 
 In light of these findings, EY has issued an adverse report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the period ended December 31, 2023, as stated in its report, which is included herein. 
 As a result of the identification of the material weakness, and prior to filing this amended Annual Report, we performed further analysis and completed additional procedures intended to ensure our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and for the three years ended December 31, 2023 and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Based on these procedures and analysis, and notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) included in this amended Annual Report fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 ESRT's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have certified that, based on each such officer s knowledge, the financial statements, as well as the other financial information included in this amended Annual Report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this amended Annual Report. In addition, EY has issued an unqualified opinion on our financial statements, which is included in Part IV of this amended Annual Report, and we have developed a remediation plan for the material weakness, which is described below. 
 Remediation of the Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We are in the process of implementing changes associated with the design, implementation and monitoring of ITGCs in the areas of logical access and change management for IT applications that support our financial statement preparation and reporting processes to ensure that internal controls are designed and operating effectively. Our remediation plans will include: 
 3 

Enhancing the current change monitoring control to use an appropriate system source to help ensure a complete population of changes are reviewed to detect if any changes were made outside the Company s established change control process across all relevant IT components. 
 Adding controls to manage the appropriate assignment and maintenance of permission configurations within access groups and the users they are assigned to. 
 Increasing the frequency of periodic re-evaluation of user access privileges. 
 Training of relevant personnel on the design and operation of our ITGCs over financial reporting. 
 We believe that these actions, collectively, will remediate the material weakness identified. However, we will not be able to conclude that we have completely remediated the material weakness until the applicable controls are fully implemented and operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through formal testing, that the remediated controls are operating effectively. We will continue to monitor the design and effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures, and controls and will make any further changes management deems appropriate. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the unremediated material weaknesses noted above, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. 
 (b) Attestation report of the independent registered public accounting firm 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Partners of Empire State Realty OP, L.P. 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Empire State Realty OP, L.P. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Empire State Realty OP, L.P. (the Operating Partnership) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria . 
 In our report dated February 28, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion that the Operating Partnership maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. Management has subsequently identified deficiencies in controls related to the design of information technology ("IT") general controls ("ITGCs") for IT systems and applications supporting the Operating Partnership s internal control over financial reporting processes and has further concluded that such deficiencies represented a material weakness as of December 31, 2023. Consequently, automated and IT dependent manual business process controls that rely upon information from the IT systems were also deemed ineffective. As a result, management has revised its assessment, as presented in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, to conclude that the Operating Partnership s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023. Accordingly, our present opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, as expressed herein, is different from that expressed in our previous report. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management s assessment. Management has identified a material weakness related to the design of ITGCs for IT systems and applications supporting the Operating Partnership s internal control over financial reporting processes. Consequently, automated and IT dependent manual business process controls that rely upon information from the IT systems were also deemed ineffective. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related 
 4 

consolidated statement of operations, comprehensive income (loss), capital and cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). The material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated February 28, 2024, except for the effect of the material weakness described above and the Critical Audit Matter described in our Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, as to which the date is October 8, 2024, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Operating Partnership s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Operating Partnership s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Operating Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Partners of Empire State Realty OP, L.P. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Empire State Realty OP, L.P. (the Operating Partnership) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss) , capital and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2024, except for the effects of the material weakness described in the third paragraph of that report as which the date is October 8, 2024, expressed an adverse opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Operating Partnership s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Operating Partnership s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Operating Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Valuation of goodwill - observatory Description of the Matter At December 31, 2023, the Operating Partnership s goodwill related to the observatory reporting unit was 227.5 million as disclosed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. 
 The Operating Partnership performed its annual impairment testing as of October 1, 2023 and engaged a third-party valuation specialist to perform valuation procedures. 
 Auditing management s goodwill impairment test was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the assumptions used. The fair value estimates were sensitive to significant assumptions such as revenue and cost projections and the weighted average cost of capital, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. 
 
 F-1 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit To test the implied fair value of the Operating Partnership s observatory reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among other procedures, assessing the methodologies and testing the significant assumptions and underlying data used by the Operating Partnership. We utilized internal valuation specialists in assessing the fair value methodologies applied and evaluating the reasonableness of certain assumptions selected by management. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, recent historical performance, and other relevant factors, and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the observatory reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. 

/s/ 
 We have served as the Operating Partnership s auditor since 2010. 
 
 February 28, 2024, except for the effects of the material weakness described in the second paragraph above and the Critical Audit Matter described above, as to which the date is October 8, 2024.

Our office portfolio included properties (including long-term ground leasehold interests) encompassing approximately million rentable square feet. of these office properties are located in midtown Manhattan and encompass approximately million rentable square feet, including the Empire State Building.

Additionally, we have entitled land adjacent to one of the Stamford office properties that can support the development of either office or residential per local zoning. Our multifamily portfolio included residential units in New York City. 
 We were organized as a Delaware limited partnership on November 28, 2011, and commenced operations upon completion of the initial public offering of ESRT s Class A common stock and related formation transactions on October 7, 2013 (the "IPO"). ESRT's Class A common stock, par value per share, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ESRT." ESRT, as the sole general partner in our Company, has responsibility and discretion in the management and control of our Company, and our limited partners, in such capacity, have no authority to transact business for, or participate in the management activities, of our Company.

 Real Estate Properties and Related Intangible Assets 
 capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the shorter of years, the useful life, or the remaining term of any leasehold interest. Tenant improvement costs, which are included in building and improvements in the consolidated balance sheets, are depreciated over the shorter of (i) the related remaining lease term or (ii) the life of the improvement. Corporate and other equipment is depreciated over three to . 
 Acquisitions of properties are accounted for utilizing the acquisition method and accordingly the purchase cost is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their fair values. The fair value of tangible assets acquired is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, applying methods similar to those used by independent appraisers of income-producing property. The resulting value is then allocated to land, buildings and improvements, and tenant improvements based on our determination of the fair value of these assets. The assumptions used in the allocation of fair values to assets acquired are based on our best estimates at the time of evaluation. 
 Fair value is assigned to above-market and below-market leases based on the difference between (a) the contractual amounts to be paid by the tenant based on the existing lease and (b) our estimate of current market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, over the remaining terms of the in-place leases. Capitalized above-market lease amounts are

During the fourth quarter 2021, we concluded that the cost basis of 383 Main Avenue, Norwalk, Connecticut exceeded its fair value when we reduced our hold period given our intent to transfer property ownership to the lender. As such, we incurred a million i mpairment charge in the year ended December 31, 2021. Our methodology to calculate the fair value of the property involved a combination of the discounted cash flow method, utilizing Level 3 unobservable inputs such as market capitalization rates obtained from external sources, and the market-based approach utilizing recent sales comparables. In April 2022, we transferred this asset back to the lender in a consensual foreclosure. Refer to Note 3 Acquisitions and Dispositions. We do not believe that the value of any of our other properties and intangible assets were impaired during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

An employee is retirement eligible when the employee attains the (i) age of for awards granted in 2020 and after and age of for awards granted before 2020 and (ii) the date on which the employee has first completed the requisite years of continuous service with us or our affiliates. Share-based compensation for market-based equity awards and performance-based equity awards is measured at the fair value of the award on the date of grant and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over three or . Additionally, for the performance-based equity awards, we assess, at each reporting period, whether it is probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied. We recognize expense respective to the number of awards we expect to vest at the conclusion of the measurement period. Changes in estimate are accounted for in the period of change through a cumulative catch-up adjustment. Any forfeitures of share-based compensation awards are recognized as they occur. 
 The determination of fair value of these awards is subjective and involves significant estimates and assumptions including expected volatility of ESRT stock, expected dividend yield, expected term, and assumptions of whether these awards will achieve parity with other operating partnership units or achieve performance thresholds. We believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized are appropriate based on the information available to management at the time of grant.

 reportable segments: (1) Real Estate and (2) Observatory. Our real estate segment includes all activities related to the ownership, management, operation, acquisition, repositioning and disposition of our real estate assets. Our Observatory segment operates the 86th and 102nd floor observatories at the Empire State Building. These lines of businesses are managed separately because each business requires different support infrastructures, provides different services and has dissimilar economic characteristics such as investments needed, stream of revenues and different marketing strategies. We account for intersegment sales and rent as if the sales or rent were to third parties, that is, at current market prices.

 As of December 31, 2023, we had goodwill of million. In 2013, we acquired the interests in Empire State Building Company, L.L.C. and 501 Seventh Avenue Associates, L.L.C. for an amount in excess of their net tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities and as a result we recorded goodwill related to the transaction. Goodwill was allocated million to the Observatory operations of the Empire State Building, million to Empire State Building, and million to 501 Seventh Avenue. 
 We performed our annual goodwill testing in October 2023, where we bypassed the optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment and proceeded directly to a quantitative assessment of the Observatory reportable segment and engaged a third-party valuation consulting firm to perform the valuation process. The quantitative analysis used a combination of the discounted cash flow method (a form of the income approach) utilizing Level 3 unobservable inputs and the guideline company method (a form of the market approach). Significant assumptions under the former included revenue and cost projections, weighted average cost of capital, long-term growth rate and income tax considerations while the latter included guideline company enterprise values, revenue multiples, EBITDA multiples and control premium rates. Our methodology to review goodwill impairment, which included a significant amount of judgment and estimates, provided a reasonable basis to determine whether impairment had occurred. The quantitative analysis performed concluded the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. Many of the factors employed in determining whether or not goodwill is impaired are outside of our control, and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods. We will continue to assess the impairment of the Observatory reporting unit goodwill going forward.

 Unsecured Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facilities 
 
 On August 29, 2022, we entered into a third amendment to our amended and restated credit agreement dated August 29, 2017 with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto, which governs our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and term loan facility (collectively, the BofA Credit Facility ). The BofA Credit Facility is

billion, which consists of a million revolving credit facility that matures on March 31, 2025, and a million term loan facility that matures on March 19, 2025. The third amendment revised the terms of the BofA Credit Facility to (i) replace LIBOR with SOFR given the phase out of LIBOR and (ii) permit the addition of multifamily assets as Unencumbered Eligible Property (as defined therein) and add a capitalization rate for such assets. As of December 31, 2023 , we had borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million under the term loan facility. 
 
 On August 29, 2022, we entered into a second amendment to our credit agreement dated March 19, 2020 with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which governs a senior unsecured term loan facility (the Wells Term Loan Facility ). The Wells Term Loan Facility is in the original principal amount of million and matures on December 31, 2026. The second amendment revised the terms of the Wells Term Loan Facility to (i) replace LIBOR with SOFR given the phase out of LIBOR and (ii) permit the addition of multifamily assets as Unencumbered Eligible Property (as defined therein) and add a capitalization rate for such assets. We may request the Wells Term Loan Facility be increased through one or more increases or the addition of new pari passu term loan tranches, for a maximum aggregate principal amount not to exceed million. As of December 31, 2023 , our borrowings amounted to million under the Wells Term Loan Facility. 
 
 The terms of both the BofA Credit Facility and the Wells Term Loan Facility include customary covenants, including limitations on liens, investment, distributions, debt, fundamental changes, and transactions with affiliates and require certain customary financial reports. Both facilities also require compliance with financial ratios including a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio, and a maximum unsecured leverage ratio. The agreements governing both facilities also contain customary events of default (subject in certain cases to specified cure periods), including but not limited to non-payment, breach of covenants, representations or warranties, cross defaults, bankruptcy or other insolvency events, judgments, ERISA events, invalidity of loan documents, loss of real estate investment trust qualification, and occurrence of a change of control. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants.

 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had interest rate swaps and caps with an aggregate notional value of million and million, respectively. The notional value does not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks. As of December 31, 2023, the fair values of our derivative instruments amounted to million which is included in prepaid expenses and other assets, and million) which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of our derivative instruments amounted to million which is included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. These interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and hedge the variability in future cash flows associated with our existing variable-rate term loan facilities. Interest rate caps not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements, but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. 
 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our cash flow hedges are deemed highly effective and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, net unrealized gains (losses) of ) million and million, respectively, are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) relating to both active and terminated cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.

years. Certain leases have renewal options for additional terms. The leases provide for base monthly rentals and reimbursements for real estate taxes, escalations linked to the consumer price index or common area maintenance known as operating expense escalation. Operating expense reimbursements are reflected in our December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 consolidated statements of operations as rental revenue.

 We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our operating lease agreements relate to ground lease assets and are reflected in right-of-use assets of million and lease liabilities of million in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are excluded from the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. 
 The ground leases are due to expire between the years 2050 and 2077, inclusive of extension options, and have no variable payments or residual value guarantees. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we determined our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the date of adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), in determining the present value of lease payments. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate used to calculate the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 was . Rent expense for lease payments related to our operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the leases.

 former investors (the "Claimants") in Empire State Building Associates L.L.C. ESBA ), which prior to the initial public offering of our Company (the "Offering"), owned the fee title to the Empire State Building, filed an arbitration with the American Arbitration Association against Peter L. Malkin, Anthony E. Malkin, Thomas N. Keltner, Jr., and our subsidiary ESRT MH Holdings LLC, the former supervisor of ESBA, (the "Respondents"). The statement of claim (also filed later in federal court in New York for the expressed purpose of tolling the statute of limitations) alleged breach of fiduciary duty and related claims in connection with the Offering and formation transactions and sought monetary damages and declaratory relief. Claimants had opted out of a prior class action bringing similar claims that was settled with court approval. Respondents filed an answer and counterclaims. In March 2015, the federal court action was stayed on consent of all parties pending the arbitration. Arbitration hearings started in May 2016 and concluded in August 2018. On August 26, 2020, the arbitration panel issued an award that denied all Claimants claims with one exception, on which it awarded Claimants approximately million, inclusive of of interest through October 2, 2020. This amount was recorded as an IPO litigation expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 
 Respondents believe that such award in favor of the Claimants is entirely without merit and sought to vacate that portion of the award. On September 27, 2021, a federal district court denied Respondents' petition to vacate and entered judgement in the aforementioned amount, inclusive of accumulated interest. Respondents appealed that ruling. On May 10, 2022, Respondents moved to dismiss the appeal and judgment on the grounds that a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court held that the federal courts have no subject matter jurisdiction over the case. On April 20, 2023, the federal appeals court granted the motion and the federal court action challenging the award was dismissed. On April 21, 2023, the Respondents filed a petition to vacate in part and otherwise confirm in New York State court. On April 28, 2023, the Claimants filed a petition to confirm in that same court. On July 31, 2023, the New York State court denied the Respondents petition to vacate in part and confirmed the award. On January 22, 2024, that court entered judgment in favor of the Claimants (save for one Claimant, whose petition to confirm is still pending in New York state court) in an amount of approximately million, inclusive of interest. The Respondents believe those rulings are incorrect and have appealed them. In addition, certain of the Claimants in the federal court action brought to toll the statute of limitations sought to pursue claims in that case against Respondents. Respondents believe that any such claims are meritless. The magistrate judge assigned to the action issued a Report and Recommendation rejecting Claimants claims; the district judge will decide whether to adopt the Report and Recommendation.

 Asset Retirement Obligations 
 We are required to accrue costs that we are legally obligated to incur on retirement of our properties which result from acquisition, construction, development and/or normal operation of such properties. Retirement includes sale, abandonment or disposal of a property. Under that standard, a conditional asset retirement obligation represents a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement is conditional on a future event that may or may not be within a company s control and a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation must be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Environmental site assessments and investigations have identified asbestos or asbestos-containing building materials in certain of our properties. As of December 31, 2023, management has no plans to remove or alter these properties in a manner that would trigger federal and other applicable regulations for asbestos removal, and accordingly, the obligations to remove the asbestos or asbestos-containing building materials from these properties have indeterminable settlement dates.

 An aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock was authorized for issuance under awards granted pursuant to the 2019 Plan, and as of December 31, 2023, approximately million shares of common stock remain available for future issuance under the Plans. 
 Long-term incentive plan ("LTIP") units are a special class of partnership interests in the Operating Partnership. Each LTIP unit awarded will be deemed equivalent to an award of share of stock under the Plans, reducing the availability for other equity awards on a -for-one basis. The vesting period for LTIP units, if any, will be determined at the time of issuance. Under the terms of the LTIP units, the Operating Partnership will revalue for tax purposes its assets upon the occurrence of certain specified events, and any increase in valuation from the time of one such event to the next such event will be allocated first to the holders of LTIP units to equalize the capital accounts of such holders with the capital accounts of OP unitholders. Subject to any agreed upon exceptions, once vested and having achieved parity with OP unitholders, LTIP units are convertible into OP Units in the Operating Partnership on a -for-one basis. 
 LTIP units subject to time-based vesting, whether vested or not, receive the same per unit distributions as OP Units, which equal per share dividends (both regular and special) on our common stock. Market and performance-based LTIPs receive of such distributions currently, unless and until such LTIP units are earned based on performance, at which time they will receive the accrued and unpaid and will commence receiving of such distributions thereafter. 
 In March 2023, we made grants of LTIP units to executive officers under the 2019 Plan, including a total of LTIP units that are subject to time-based vesting, LTIP units that are subject to market-based vesting and units

million, million and million, respectively. In March 2023, we made grants of LTIP units and restricted stock to certain other employees under the 2019 Plan, including a total of LTIP units and shares of restricted stock that are subject to time-based vesting, LTIP units that are subject to market-based vesting and LTIP units that are subject to performance-based vesting, with fair market values of million and million, respectively, for the time-based vesting awards, million for the market-based vesting awards and million for the performance-based vesting awards. The awards subject to time-based vesting vest ratably over , subject generally to the grantee's continued employment, with the first installment vesting on January 1, 2024. The vesting of the LTIP units subject to market-based vesting is based on the achievement of relative total stockholder return hurdles over a performance period, commencing on January 1, 2023. The vesting of the LTIP units subject to performance-based vesting is based on the achievement of (i) operational metrics over a performance period, subject to a absolute TSR modifier, and (ii) environmental, social and governance metrics over a performance period, in each case, commencing on January 1, 2023. Following the completion of the respective performance periods, our Compensation and Human Capital Committee will determine the number of LTIP units to which the grantee is entitled based on our performance relative to the performance hurdles set forth in the LTIP unit award agreements the grantee entered in connection with the award grant. These LTIP units then vest in equal installments, on January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2026, subject generally to the grantee's continued employment on those dates. 
 In March 2023, we also made one-time additional grants of LTIP units to certain non-executive employees under the 2019 Plan. At such time, we granted to certain other employees a total of LTIP units that are subject to time-based vesting, with a fair market value of million that vest over four and five year periods. 
 
 In 2023, our named executive officers could elect to receive their annual incentive bonus in any combination of (i) cash or vested LTIPs at the face amount of such bonus or (ii) time-vesting LTIPs which would vest over , subject to continued employment, at a premium over such face amount for awards granted in 2021, 2022, and 2023; for years prior to 2021). In March 2023, we made grants of LTIP units to executive officers under the 2019 Plan in connection with the 2022 bonus election program. We granted to executive officers a total of LTIP units that are subject to time-based vesting with a fair market value of million. Of these LTIP units, LTIP units vest ratably over from January 1, 2023, subject generally to the grantee's continued employment. The first installment vests on January 1, 2024, and the remainder will vest thereafter in equal annual installments on January 1, 2025 and January 1, 2026. We also granted to our retired general counsel LTIP units that vested immediately on the grant date. 
 
 Annually, we make grants of LTIP units to our non-employee directors under the 2019 Plan. In May 2023, each of our directors received of their annual base retainer in the form of equity vesting ratably over , and could elect to receive the remaining of such base retainer in (i) cash at the face value of the award, (ii) immediately vesting equity at the face value of the award, or (iii) equity vesting ratably over at of the face amount. Each director could elect to receive any equity portion of the base retainer in either (i) LTIP units or (ii) restricted shares of our Class A common stock. In accordance with each director's election, in May 2023, we granted a total of LTIP units that are subject to time-based vesting with fair market values of million. The LTIP units vest ratably over three or four years from the date of the grant, based on grantee election, subject generally to the director's continued service on ESRT's Board of Directors. 
 
 During July 2023, we granted our new directors, Christina Van Tassell and Hannah Yang, a total of LTIP units which are subject to time-based vesting with a combined fair market value of million. One-fourth of the units will vest on May 12, 2024, and the remainder shall vest in substantially equal installments on each subsequent anniversary for a period of three years thereafter. 
 
 Share-based compensation for time-based equity awards is measured at the fair value of the award on the date of grant and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the shorter of (i) the stated vesting period, which is generally three , four or , or (ii) the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes retirement eligible, which may occur upon grant. An employee is retirement eligible when the employee attains the (i) age of for awards granted in 2020 and after, and age of for awards granted before 2020 and (ii) the date on which the employee has first completed the requisite years of continuous service with us or our affiliates. Share-based compensation for market-based equity awards and performance-based equity awards is measured at the fair value of the award on the date of grant and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over three or . Additionally, for the performance-based equity awards, we assess, at each reporting period, whether it is probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied. We recognize expense respective to the number of awards we expect to vest at the conclusion of the measurement period. Changes in estimate are accounted for in the period of change through a cumulative catch-up adjustment. Any forfeitures of share-based compensation awards are recognized as they occur.

 million, to an entity affiliated with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony E. Malkin (the Westport Transaction ). The Company determined to make the sale to the related party entity after a marketed sale process conducted from February 2022 through August 2022 through a broker in which it received several third-party bids. Deals with third-party purchasers failed to materialize due to adverse changes in capital market conditions during that time. The Westport Transaction materialized due to timing because the related party entity had recently completed a sale of property and was in the market for exchange property to defer tax in a 1031 exchange, and the Company recently executed on the acquisition of 298 Mulberry Street. The million valuation for the Westport Transaction is in the range of the bids the Company received during the marketed sale process. 
 In connection with the Westport Transaction, we advanced a loan to the buyer to facilitate closing with a maximum principal amount of up to million, which bore interest at SOFR plus and required repayment of principal to the extent of available cash flow of the property. As of December 31, 2023, the loan has been fully paid. 
 The Company has a written Related Party Transactions Policy (the Policy which requires the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to review the material facts of all related party transactions and consider all relevant factors in approving any related party transaction. Further, the Policy provides that a director or executive officer shall not participate in any consideration, discussion or approval of such related party transaction in which he or she is a related party. The Westport Transaction process was completed in compliance with the Policy. 
 The independent members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducted an independent review under the guidance of outside counsel and then approved the transaction. The Company reviewed with outside counsel best

properties, which we refer to in this section as the protected assets. 
 First, this agreement provides that we will not sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of such protected assets, or any interest in a protected asset, until (i) October 7, 2025, with respect to one protected asset, First Stamford Place, and (ii) the later of (x) October 7, 2021 and (y) the death of both Peter L. Malkin and Isabel W. Malkin, who are 90 and 87 years old, respectively, for the three other protected assets, Metro Center, 298 Mulberry Street substituted basis property as contemplated by the tax protection agreement for 10 Bank Street, which was sold on December 7, 2022) and 1542 Third Avenue, unless: 
 (1) Anthony E. Malkin consents to the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition; or 
 (2) we deliver to each protected party thereunder a cash payment intended to approximate the tax liability arising from the recognition of the pre-contribution built-in gain resulting from the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of such protected asset (with the pre-contribution built-in gain being not more than the taxable gain that would have been recognized by such protected party if the protected asset been sold for fair market value in a taxable transaction at the time of the consolidation) plus an additional amount so that, after the payment of all taxes on amounts received pursuant to the agreement (including any tax liability incurred as a result of receiving such payment), the protected party retains an amount equal to such protected party s total tax liability incurred as a result of the recognition of the pre-contribution built-in gain pursuant to such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition; or 
 (3) the disposition does not result in a recognition of any built-in gain by the protected party. 
 Second, with respect to the Malkin Group, including Anthony E. Malkin and Peter L. Malkin, and one additional third-party investor in Metro Center (who was one of the original landowners and was involved in the development of the property), to protect against gain recognition resulting from a reduction in such continuing investor s share of our liabilities, the agreement provides that during the period from October 7, 2013 until such continuing investor owns less than the aggregate number of operating partnership units and shares of ESRT common stock equal to of the aggregate number of such units and shares such investor received in the formation transactions, which we refer to in this section as the tax protection period, we will (i) refrain from prepaying any amounts outstanding under any indebtedness secured by the protected assets and (ii) use our commercially reasonable efforts to refinance such indebtedness at or prior to maturity at its current principal amount, or, if we are unable to refinance such indebtedness at its current principal amount, at the highest principal amount possible. The agreement also provides that, during the tax protection period, we will make available to such continuing investors the opportunity (i) to enter into a bottom dollar guarantee of their allocable share of million of our aggregate indebtedness meeting certain requirements or (ii) in the event we have recourse debt outstanding and such a continuing investor agrees, in lieu of guaranteeing debt pursuant to clause (i) above, to enter into a deficit restoration obligation, in each case, in a manner intended to provide an allocation of our liabilities to the continuing investor. In the event that a continuing investor guarantees our debt, such continuing investor will be responsible, under certain circumstances, for the repayment of the guaranteed amount to the lender in the event that the lender would otherwise recognize a loss on the loan, such as, for example, if property securing the loan was foreclosed and the value was not sufficient to repay a certain amount of the debt. A deficit restoration obligation is a continuing investor s obligation, under certain circumstances, to contribute a designated amount of capital to us upon our liquidation in the event that our assets are insufficient to repay our liabilities. 
 Because we expect that we will at all times have sufficient liabilities to allow us to meet our obligations to allocate liabilities to our partners that are protected parties under the tax protection agreement, our indemnification obligation with respect to certain tax liabilities would generally arise only in the event that we dispose in a taxable transaction of a protected asset within the period specified above in a taxable transaction. In the event of such a disposition, the amount of our indemnification obligation would depend on several factors, including the amount of built-in gain, if any, recognized and allocated to the indemnified partners with respect to such disposition and the effective tax rate to be applied to such gain at the time of such disposition. Our disposition of the 10 Bank Street asset on December 7, 2022 did not trigger any obligation of payment pursuant to the tax protection agreement.

 Registration Rights 
 We entered into a registration rights agreement with certain persons receiving shares of ESRT common stock or operating partnership units in the formation transactions, including certain members of ESRT's senior management team and our other continuing investors. In connection therewith, we have filed, and are obligated to maintain the effectiveness of, an automatically effective shelf registration statement, along with a prospectus supplement, with respect to, among other things, shares of ESRT Class A common stock that may be issued upon redemption of operating partnership units or issued upon conversion of shares of ESRT Class B common stock to continuing investors in the public existing entities. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, under certain circumstances, ESRT will also be required to undertake an underwritten offering upon the written request of the Malkin Group, which we refer to as the holder, provided (i) the registrable shares to be registered in such offering will have a market value of at least million, (ii) ESRT will not be obligated to effect more than underwritten offerings during any 12-month period; and (iii) the holder will not have the ability to effect more than underwritten offerings. In addition, if ESRT files a registration statement with respect to an underwritten offering for its own account or on behalf of the holder, the holder will have the right, subject to certain limitations, to register such number of registrable shares held by him, her or it as each such holder requests. With respect to underwritten offerings on behalf of the holder, ESRT will have the right to register such number of primary shares as it requests; provided, however, that if cut backs are required by the managing underwriters of such an offering, ESRT's primary shares shall be cutback first (but in no event will our shares be cut back to less than million). 
 ESRT has also agreed to indemnify the persons receiving rights against specified liabilities, including certain potential liabilities arising under the Securities Act, or to contribute to the payments such persons may be required to make in respect thereof. ESRT has agreed to pay all of the expenses relating to the registration and any underwritten offerings of such securities, including, without limitation, all registration, listing, filing and stock exchange or FINRA fees, all fees and expenses of complying with securities or blue sky laws, all printing expenses and all fees and disbursements of counsel and independent public accountants retained by ESRT, but excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, any out-of-pocket expenses (except ESRT will pay any holder s out-of-pocket fees (including disbursements of such holder s counsel, accountants and other advisors) up to in the aggregate for each underwritten offering and each filing of a resale shelf registration statement or demand registration statement), and any transfer taxes. 
 Employment Agreement and Change in Control Severance Agreements 
 ESRT entered into an employment agreement with Anthony E. Malkin, which provides for salary, bonuses and other benefits, including among other things, severance benefits upon a termination of employment under certain circumstances and the issuance of equity awards. In addition, ESRT entered into change in control severance agreements with Thomas P. Durels and Christina Chiu.

multi-family properties and net leased retail properties, (including single tenant retail property in Greenwich, Connecticut). The Malkin Group also owns non-controlling interests in Manhattan office property, Manhattan retail properties and several retail properties outside of Manhattan, none of which were contributed to us in the formation transactions, and retail properties in Westport, Connecticut acquired from ESRT in February 2023 (see Sale of Westport Retail Properties above). We refer to the non-controlling interests described above collectively as the excluded properties. In addition, the Malkin Group owns interests in senior equity fund and property managers, which we refer to collectively as the excluded businesses. We do not believe that the excluded properties or the excluded businesses are consistent with our current commercial portfolio or strategic direction. 
 Pursuant to management and/or service agreements with the owners of interests in those excluded properties and businesses, we are designated as the asset manager (supervisor) and/or property manager of the excluded properties, provide services to certain of the excluded properties and the other excluded businesses. As the manager or service provider, we are paid a management or other fee with respect to those excluded properties and businesses where our predecessor had previously received a management fee, and reimbursed for our costs in providing the management and other services to those excluded properties and businesses where our predecessor had not previously received a management fee. Our management of the excluded properties and provision of services to the residential property managers and the existing managers of the other excluded businesses represent a minimal portion of our overall business. There is no established time period in which we will continue to provide such services; and Peter L. Malkin and Anthony E. Malkin expect to sell certain properties or unwind these businesses over time. We are not precluded from acquiring all or certain interests in the excluded properties or businesses. If we were to attempt any such acquisition, we anticipate that Anthony E. Malkin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will not participate in the negotiation process on our behalf with respect to our potential acquisition of any of these excluded properties or businesses, and the approval of a majority of our independent directors will be required to approve any such acquisition. 
 Services are and were provided by us to excluded properties and businesses. These transactions are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as third-party management and other fees. 
 We earned asset management (supervisory) and service fees from excluded properties and businesses of million, million and million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 We earned property management fees from excluded properties of million, million and million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
