Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues, net . Revenues increased 2.0 million, or 10 , to 22.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by an increase in member count as well as improvements in ARPU Average Revenue Per User ). 
 Cost of revenues . Cost of revenues increased 0.1 million or 3.3 to 3.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which is primarily related to the increase in revenues and revenue mix. Gross profit margin increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 86.0 from 85.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to improvements in ARPU. 
 14 

Selling and operating expenses . Selling and operating expenses increased 2.1 million, or 12.9 , to 18.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by the absence of the ERTC Employee Retention Tax Credit benefit recognized in the third quarter 2023. Without the credit of 1.75 million in 2023, selling and operating expense during the three months ended September 30, 2023 would have been 18.1 million. As a percentage of net revenues, selling and operating expenses increased to 83.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 80.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Corporate, general and administration expenses . Corporate, general and administration expenses increased 0.6 million, or 42.9 to 2.0 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.4 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net revenues, these expenses increased to 9.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues, net . Revenues increased 6.2 million, or 10.4 , to 65.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 59.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by an increase in member count as well as an increase in ARPU. 
 Cost of revenues . Cost of revenues increased 1.1 million or 12.8 to 9.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which is primarily related to the increase in revenues and revenue mix. Gross profit margin decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 85.3 from 85.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increased content amortization related to an overall increase in our investment of our original content offerings and revenue mix. 
 Selling and operating expenses . Selling and operating expenses increased 5.4 million, or 10.9 , to 54.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 49.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by an increase in marketing expense and people related expenses in addition to the absence of an ERTC benefit recognized in the third quarter 2023. Without the credit of 1.75 million in 2023, selling and operating expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 would have been 51.3 million. As a percentage of net revenues, selling and operating expenses increased to 83.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 82.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Corporate, general and administration expenses . Corporate, general and administration expenses increased 0.9 million, or 19.1 to 5.6 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.7 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net revenues, these expenses increased to 8.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Seasonality 
 Our member base reflects seasonal variations driven primarily by periods when consumers typically spend more time indoors and, as a result, tend to increase their viewing, similar to those of traditional TV and cable networks. We have generally experienced the greatest member growth in the fourth and first quarters (October through February), and slowest during May through August. This drives quarterly variations in our spending on member acquisition efforts and the number of net new subscribers we add each quarter but does not result in a corresponding seasonality in net revenue. As we continue to expand internationally, we expect regional seasonality trends to demonstrate more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have a longer history to assess such patterns. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our capital needs arise from working capital required to fund operations, capital expenditures related to acquisition and development of media content, development and marketing of our digital platforms, acquisitions of new businesses and other investments, replacements, expansions and improvements to our infrastructure, and future growth. These capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including the rate of market acceptance of our offerings, our ability to expand our customer base, the cost of ongoing upgrades to our offerings, our expenditures for marketing, and other factors. Additionally, we will continue to pursue opportunities to expand our media libraries, evaluate possible investments in businesses and technologies, and increase our marketing programs as needed. 
 Our budgeted content and capital expenditures for the remainder of 2024 are expected to be between 3.0 to 4.0 million which we intend to fund with cash flows generated from operations. These planned expenditures will be predominately utilized to expand our content library and build out the capabilities of our digital platforms. The planned expenditures are discretionary and, with our in-house production capabilities, we have the ability to scale expenditures based on the available cash flows from operations. We began to generate positive cash flows from operations in 2020 and have continued to generate cash flows from operations since. We expect 
 15 

to continue generating positive cash flows from operations during the remainder of 2024. We generated approximately 4.3 million in cash flows from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, our cash balance was 4.4 million. 
 As described in Note 4, during August 2022, we entered into a Credit Agreement with KeyBank, which provides for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to 10.0 million. Funds from the Credit Agreement are available for working capital and general corporate purposes, but not to fund any permitted acquisitions or other investments. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. 
 As described in Note 10, in April 2024, the Company entered into a series of transactions with its subsidiary, Igniton, and a third-party entity to purchase a perpetual license for a total of 16.2 million of consideration comprised of 10.2 million of cash and 5.0 million of common stock of Igniton and 1.0 million of the Company s equity security investment in Telomeron (the License Purchase ). The license allows the Company to utilize the technology developed by the third party. This license is being recorded within the Technology license, net line item on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The License Purchase was primarily funded through an equity financing through Igniton which raised 6.8 million of cash from third-party investors. 
 In the normal course of our business, we investigate, evaluate and discuss acquisition, joint venture, minority investment, strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in our market. For any future investment, acquisition, or joint venture opportunities, we may consider using then-available liquidity, issuing equity securities or incurring indebtedness. 
 While there can be no assurances, we believe our cash on hand, our cash expected to be generated from operations, our potential additional borrowing capabilities now that we have a history of generating positive operating cash flows, and our potential capital raising capabilities will be sufficient to fund our operations on both a short-term and long-term basis. However, our projected cash needs may change as a result of acquisitions, product development, unforeseen operational difficulties, or other factors.

Operating activities . Cash flows provided by operations increased approximately 1.6 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by changes in earnings and the timing of working capital, primarily accrued liabilities and deferred revenues. 
 Investing activities . Cash flows used, including the investing activities within our 71 owned subsidiary, increased 10.9 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to a technology license acquired during the second quarter. Excluding this subsidiary license purchase, the cash flow used would be a decrease of 3.0 million. 
 Financing activities . Cash flows provided by financing activities were primarily impacted by raising funds through Gaia s subsidiary, Igniton. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management (i.e., the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer), conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon its evaluation as of September 30, 2024, our management has concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level based on the previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. Notwithstanding the previously identified material weaknesses, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Previously Identified Material Weakness 
 In the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, we identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses as of December 31, 2023. 
 Specifically, we determined that we did not have appropriate technical accounting and financial reporting capabilities to properly record in our financial statements certain complex or unusual transactions. Additionally, we determined our financial close and reporting process was inadequate due to insufficient analysis of certain accounts and inadequate financial reporting systems. 
 These material weaknesses resulted in incorrect accounting entries that were identified and corrected through the audit of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, these material weaknesses resulted in errors in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 through September 30, 2023. 
 Ongoing Remediation of Previously Identified Material Weakness 
 We have begun taking measures, and plan to continue to take measures, to remediate the material weaknesses. In order to address these material weaknesses, we have begun to implement additional procedures and controls in the financial statement close and reporting process, which include enhanced system capabilities in most areas, enhanced reconciliation controls, enhanced review controls and financial close checklists which aim to ensure all necessary reviews and reconciliations are occurring as designed. Additionally, we have begun to enhance access to accounting training, literature, research materials and plan to increase communication channels among our personnel and outsourced third-party professionals with whom we may consult regarding the application of complex accounting transactions. We also hired additional accounting and finance personnel with technical accounting and financial reporting experience. 
 We believe the measures described above along with other elements of our remediation plan will remediate the material weaknesses identified and strengthen our internal controls over financial reporting. We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and have begun to implement the measures described above. We will also continue to review, optimize and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional measures to address control deficiencies or we may modify certain of the remediation measures described above. We will not consider our material weaknesses remediated until the applicable remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 For more information concerning the material weakness identified and remediation steps, see the section titled Risk Factors Risks Related to our Material Weakness and Restatements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on March 29, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the ongoing material weakness remediation activities described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
