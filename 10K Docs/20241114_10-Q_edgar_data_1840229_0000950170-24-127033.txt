 million and cash and cash equivalents of million. MiNK believes that its cash and cash equivalents balance, plus anticipated funding from partnerships, will be sufficient to satisfy its liquidity requirements for more than one year from when these financial statements were issued. Because the completion of anticipated funding is not entirely within the Company s control, the Company is required to disclose that substantial doubt exists about its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q . Management continually monitors MiNK's liquidity position and adjusts spending as needed in order to preserve liquidity. To support its liquidity requirements the Company will require additional funding. Potential sources of additional funding for the Company include: (1) seeking strategic partnerships and collaborations, as well as out-licensing opportunities, for the Company's portfolio programs and product candidates, (2) exploring avenues for securing non-dilutive financing, such as grants, collaborations, and providing fee-based services to strengthen the Company's balance sheet, and (3) potential of equity or debt financing options. The financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes MiNK will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. MiNK s product candidates are in various stages of development and additional expenditures will be required if the Company starts new trials, encounters delays in its programs, applies for regulatory approvals, continues development of its technologies, expands its operations, and/or brings its product candidates to market. The eventual total cost of each clinical trial is dependent on a number of factors such as trial design, length of the trial, number of clinical sites, and number of patients. The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new therapeutic products is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. Because all of the Company s programs are at an early stage of clinical development, the Company is unable to reliably estimate the cost of completing its research and development programs or the timing for bringing such programs to various markets or substantial partnering or out-licensing arrangements, and, therefore, when, if ever, material cash inflows are likely to commence .

The Company is also entitled to use Agenus business offices and laboratory space and equipment in exchange for the Company contributing a proportionate payment for the use of such facilities and equipment, and the Company will be covered by certain Agenus insurance policies, subject to certain conditions, including the Company paying the cost of such coverage. Either party may terminate the New Intercompany Agreement upon days prior written notice and individual services upon days prior written notice. Allocated Agenus services primarily include payroll related expenses, facility costs, insurance and stock-based compensation, and are included in the accompanying financial statements based on certain estimates and allocations described above. Under the Prior Intercompany Agreement, the allocation methods primarily included time devoted to activities and headcount-based allocations. Agenus business services and occupancy costs were allocated to the Company based on the Company s headcount as a percentage of Agenus and the Company was required to pay of Agenus costs for these business services and occupancy costs. Research services were charged between the entities based on hours recorded by Agenus employees as time spent on specific projects, applied to hourly wage rates, and the Company paid of Agenus costs for these research services. As such, these allocations may not be indicative of the actual amounts that would have been recorded had the Company operated as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented. Allocation of Agenus services, net of approximately and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is included in Operating expenses in the Company s statement of operations and Due to related parties, of million as of September 30, 2024, in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet.

The Purchase Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions, including representations and warranties, for the Company s issuance and sale of the Note to Agenus. The Company may draw down on the principal amount of the Note from time to time with Agenus s consent in any increment, either in the form of advancements or payments made by Agenus on the Company s behalf.

 Our most advanced product candidate, agenT-797, is an off-the-shelf, allogeneic, native iNKT cell therapy. iNKTs are a potent class of immune cells and serve as master regulators of immune response, possessing the killing power of NK cells and the memory of T-cells. Our proprietary manufacturing platform enables the infusion of these cells in billion-fold quantities, equipping the immune system to combat cancer and other life-threatening diseases. We have successfully established and launched in-house iNKT cell manufacturing and product release capacity, capable of supplying over 5,000 doses annually through a U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA )-cleared, scalable, fully closed, and automated process. 
 Our clinical development of agenT-797 is advancing in multiple therapeutic areas of significant unmet needs. These include a Phase 2 trial in 2L gastric cancer and viral acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS in populations of patients where there are critical gaps in current treatment options. 
 In solid cancers, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of agenT-797 in solid tumor cancers, both as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab. The trial demonstrated durable clinical benefits with a tolerable safety profile across various heavily pre-treated solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC ), testicular cancer, and gastric cancer. Notably, the median progression-free survival exceeded six months, with approximately 30 of patients experiencing durable disease stabilization, even in cancers refractory to prior therapies such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab. Building on these results, a randomized, Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial led by Dr. Yelena Janjigian at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center is actively enrolling. This trial aims to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of the combination of agenT-797, botensilimab (a novel Fc-enhanced CTLA-4 inhibitor), balstilimab (anti-PD-1), ramucirumab, and paclitaxel in patients with previously treated, advanced esophageal, gastric, or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. The study, which is expected to enroll approximately 38 patients with advanced, unresectable, or metastatic forms of these cancers, is a priority program for us. Encouraging activity was observed with agenT-797 in both monotherapy and combination settings, with durable responses and disease stabilization, as presented at the American Association for Cancer Research AACR and more recently at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer SITC conference in November 2023. 
 In inflammatory diseases, we have completed a phase 1 study of agenT-797 in viral ARDS, leveraging the unique anti-inflammatory properties of iNKT cells. Results from our Phase 1 study were published in Nature Communications and presented at the American Thoracic Society International Conference over the past two years. We reported an encouraging survival benefit of 75 , compared to approximately 10-22 in an in-hospital control group and time-matched data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a cohort of 21 patients on mechanical ventilation, survival rates exceeded 70 , with an 80 survival rate among those on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In addition to a survival benefit, agenT-797 improved lung function and significantly reduced inflammation and secondary infections, which are major contributors to comorbidity and mortality in intensive 
 13 

care units. Given the lack of approved therapies for ARDS, we plan to advance agenT-797 in viral ARDS through strategic collaborations and non-dilutive external financing into a randomized Phase 2 trial. 
 
 Our pipeline is advancing next-generation allogeneic, engineered iNKT programs. Our two most advanced engineered programs are (1) MiNK-215, an IL-15 armored tumor stromal targeting FAP-CAR-iNKT and (2) MiNK-413, an IL-15 armored CAR-iNKT program targeting BCMA program. MiNK-413 has demonstrated tumor clearance and improved persistence in preclinical models, as well as manufacturing and logistical improvements over current BCMA cell therapies. MiNK-215 has demonstrated efficacy in NSCLC and melanoma preclinical models, promoting curative responses, eliminating tumor burden in the lungs, and enhancing tumor specific CD8+ T cell infiltration through tumor stroma. These data and programs were presented at AACR in 2024, International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference in 2023, SITC in 2023, and the American Society of Cell and Gene Therapy in 2023. Most recently, preclinical data from MiNK-215 in microsatellite stability colorectal cancer liver metastases were presented at AACR 2024. This presentation highlighted MiNK-215 s potent anti-tumor activity, immune activation, and tumor stroma remodeling against this difficult-to-treat solid tumor setting. Investigational new drug IND enabling activities are underway we expect to submit an IND to the FDA in 2025. 
 In December 2023, we announced a collaboration with ImmunoScape, Inc. ("ImmunoScape") to discover and develop next-generation T-cell receptor therapies against novel targets in solid tumors. We will combine our unique, proprietary library of T cell antigens with ImmunoScape s platform for rapid discovery of novel T cell receptors. ImmunoScape s unique Deep Immunomics platform enables high-throughput and sensitive screening of T cells against relevant tumor targets for the rapid discovery of rare, therapeutically-relevant T-cell receptors TCRs ). We have a proprietary library of phospho-peptide neoantigens derived from a wide range of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. In this collaborative effort, ImmunoScape will leverage its capabilities in multiplex antigen screening and in-depth T cell profiling to identify relevant TCRs targeting the library of phospho-peptide antigens. We will further characterize these tumor-specific TCRs, leveraging our proprietary capabilities to analyze and select TCR candidates for optimal tumor targeting. Any intellectual property resulting from the arrangement would be jointly owned by the parties.

Historical Results of Operations 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Research and development expense 
 Research and development R D expense includes the costs associated with our internal research and development activities, including compensation and benefits, occupancy costs, manufacturing costs, costs of expert consultants, and administrative costs. R D expense decreased 84 to 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a 1.8 million gain recorded from the forgiveness of certain previously recorded liabilities, decreased costs associated with both the timing of our clinical trials and pre-clinical activities, and decreased personnel costs, primarily due to decreased headcount. 
 General and administrative expense 
 General and administrative G A expense consists primarily of personnel costs, facility expenses, and professional fees. G A expense decreased 35 to 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily due to decreased personnel costs, mainly due to decreased share based compensation expense and decreased headcount. 
 Interest income, net 
 Interest income decreased 29,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from income of 107,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to income of 78,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to decreased interest earned on our money market funds and interest expense accrued under our related party note (the Note ). 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Research and development expense 
 R D expense includes the costs associated with our internal research and development activities, including compensation and benefits, occupancy costs, manufacturing costs, costs of expert consultants, and administrative costs. R D expense decreased 60 to 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 12.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily due to a 1.8 million gain recorded from the forgiveness of certain previously recorded liabilities, decreased costs associated with both the timing of our clinical trials and pre-clinical activities, and decreased personnel costs, primarily due to decreased headcount. 
 General and administrative expense 
 G A expense consists primarily of personnel costs, facility expenses, and professional fees. G A expense decreased 33 to 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is primarily due to decreased personnel costs, mainly due to decreased share based compensation expense and decreased headcount. 
 Other income, net 
 Other income, net of approximately 331,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consists primarily of the 185,000 gain recognized on the deconsolidation of a foreign subsidiary and the recognition of a refundable R D tax credit in the UK. 
 Interest income, net 
 Interest income decreased 289,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from income of 422,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to income of 133,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to decreased interest earned on our money market funds and interest expense accrued under the Note. 
 Research and Development Programs 
 R D program costs include compensation and other direct costs plus an allocation of indirect costs, based on certain assumptions.

Our product candidates are in various stages of development and significant additional expenditures will be required if we start new clinical trials, encounter delays in our programs, apply for regulatory approvals, continue development of our technologies, expand our operations and/or bring our product candidates to market. The total cost of any particular clinical trial is dependent on a number of factors such as trial design, length of the trial, number of clinical sites, number of patients and trial sponsorship. The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new products is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Because of the current stage of our product candidates, among other factors, we are unable to reliably estimate the cost of completing our research and development programs or the timing for bringing such programs to various markets or substantial partnering or out-licensing arrangements, and, therefore, when, if ever, material cash inflows are likely to commence. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have incurred annual operating losses since inception in 2017, and we had an accumulated deficit of 141.7 million as of September 30, 2024. We expect to incur losses over the next several years as we continue development of our technologies and product candidates, manage our regulatory processes, initiate and continue clinical trials, and prepare for potential commercialization of products. 
 In October 2021, we completed an initial public offering of 3,333,334 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of 12.00 per share. The gross proceeds from the offering, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses, were approximately 46.0 million, which included the exercise of the underwriters option to acquire an additional 500,000 shares at the public offering price, which shares were delivered in November 2021. Underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses, were approximately 6.2 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately 39.8 million. 
 In December 2018, we entered into an agreement with the Walloon Region in which the Walloon Region agreed to provide a grant of up to 1.3 million and an advance of up to 8.3 million for the development of one of our research programs. As of September 30, 2024, we had received 881,000 of the grant portion and 5.2 million of the advance. During 2020, we discontinued research efforts related to this program, and in 2021 we provided additional information as requested by the Walloon Region to terminate the agreement. We learned in the second quarter of 2022 that the Walloon Region had obtained a default judgment in the amount of 2,086,712 for repayment of the advance. In view of the default judgment, we reduced the recorded liability and recorded a gain of approximately 2.7 million in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have included the remaining balance of 2.3 million in other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. On May 13, 2024, the tribunal de l entreprise du Brabant Wallon appointed a bankruptcy trustee and declared AgenTus Therapeutics SA bankrupt. 
 We had a Note outstanding as of September 30, 2024 of 5.0 million in principal plus accrued and unpaid interest of approximately 54,000. The Note provides that we will pay Agenus on demand the principal amount outstanding, together with any unpaid interest, on or after January 1, 2026. In the event of a qualified financing event, as described in the Note, at Agenus election, we must pay the principal amount outstanding and any unpaid interest, either in full or in the form of equity securities. 
 In May 2024, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with an investor, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 4,640,000 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of 1.25 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 5.8 million. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents balance as of September 30, 2024 was 6.3 million. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance, plus anticipated funding from partnerships, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for more than one year from when these financial statements were issued. Because the completion of anticipated funding is not entirely within our control, we are required to disclose that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Management continually monitors the Company's liquidity position and adjusts spending as needed in order to preserve liquidity. To support our liquidity requirements we will require additional funding. Potential sources of additional funding include: (1) 
 16 

seeking strategic partnerships and collaborations, as well as out-licensing opportunities, for our portfolio programs and product candidates, (2) exploring avenues for securing non-dilutive financing, such as grants, collaborations, and providing fee-based services to strengthen our balance sheet, and (3) potential of equity or debt financing options. 
 The financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes we will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 7.8 million and 12.7 million, respectively. Our future ability to generate cash from operations will depend on achieving regulatory approval and market acceptance of our product candidates, and our ability to enter into collaborations. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as could, expect, anticipate, estimate, target, may, project, guidance, intend, plan, believe, will, potential, opportunity, and future, and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. You can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements relate to, among other things, our business strategy, our research and development, our product development efforts, our ability to develop, including our ability to develop and obtain licensure of agenT-797, MiNK-215, and MiNK-413, our prospects for initiating partnerships or collaborations, the timing of the introduction of products, the effect of new accounting pronouncements, uncertainty regarding our future operating results and our profitability, our cash runway and anticipated sources of funds as well as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. 
 More detailed descriptions of these risks and uncertainties and other risks and uncertainties applicable to our business that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements are included in in Part I-Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. We encourage you to read those descriptions carefully. Although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved. We caution investors not to place significant reliance on forward-looking statements contained in this document; such statements need to be evaluated in light of all the information contained in this document. Furthermore, the statements speak only as of the date of this document, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. 
 JOBS Act 
 We qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies, including reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements, exemption from the requirements to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments and exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. 
 We may take advantage of these exemptions until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company earlier if we have more than 1.235 billion in annual revenue, we have more than 700.0 million in market value of our stock held by non-affiliates (and we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one annual report on Form 10-K) or we issue more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted, and intend, to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions. 
 In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard and will do so until such time that we either (i) irrevocably elect to opt out of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualify as an 
 17 

emerging growth company. Therefore, the reported results of operations contained in our consolidated financial statements may not be directly comparable to those of other public companies.

 This item is not required for smaller reporting companies. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. It should be noted that any system of controls is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurances that the system will achieve its stated goals under all reasonably foreseeable circumstances. Our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective at a level that provides such reasonable assurances. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
