 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this quarterly report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed under the headings Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements in both our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in this quarterly report. 
 Overview 
 Our mission is to improve the lives of people with diabetes. We are primarily engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of our proprietary Omnipod platform, a continuous insulin delivery system for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. The Omnipod platform includes: the most recent generation Omnipod 5 and its predecessors Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod, all of which eliminate the need for multiple daily injections using syringes or insulin pens or the use of pump and tubing. Omnipod 5, which builds on our Omnipod DASH mobile platform, is a tubeless automated insulin delivery system, that integrates with continuous glucose monitors CGM to manage blood sugar and is fully controlled by a compatible personal smartphone or Omnipod 5 Controller. The CGMs are sold separately by third parties. Omnipod DASH features a secure Bluetooth enabled Pod that is controlled by a smartphone-like Personal Diabetes Manager PDM with a color touch screen user interface. 
 Our financial objective is to sustain profitable growth. To achieve this, we launched Omnipod 5 in the United States in 2022, and in the United Kingdom and Germany in June and August 2023, respectively. Most recently, in June 2024, we launched our full market releases of Omnipod 5 in the Netherlands and France. We are working on further building our international teams and advancing our regulatory, reimbursement, and market development efforts so we can bring Omnipod 5 to additional international markets. 
 In June 2024, we submitted our 510(k) for an expanded indication of Omnipod 5 for type 2 diabetes to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA for 510(k) clearance and in August 2024, we received FDA clearance for the expansion of Omnipod 5 for people with type 2 diabetes. Due to the positive results of our Omnipod 5 type 2 pivotal trial and the learnings from our Omnipod GO pilot, we made a strategic decision to drive growth in the type 2 diabetes market with Omnipod 5 and, accordingly, during the second quarter, we decided not to move forward with the commercialization of Omnipod GO. 
 During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we completed participant enrollment in our RADIANT study in France, the U.S, and Belgium, which is our Omnipod 5 with Libre 2 randomized controlled trial. Similar to the randomized control trial that we completed in the U.S. and France for Omnipod 5 with DexCom s G6 CGM, the objective is to provide data to support our pricing and market access initiatives as we roll out Omnipod 5 with multiple sensors across our international markets. 
 We also continue to focus on our product development efforts, including automated insulin delivery AID offerings, such as choice of smartphone integration and CGM, and enhancing the customer experience through digital product and data capabilities. In June 2024, we began our full market release of Omnipod 5 with Dexcom s G7 CGM in the United States. Similarly, in June 2024 we launched our full market release of Omnipod 5 with Libre 2 Plus for individuals aged two years and older with type 1 diabetes in both the U.K. and the Netherlands, where we now offer sensor of choice (integration with either Abbott s Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor or Dexcom s G6 CGM). Omnipod 5 integration with Dexcom s G6 CGM is also available in the U.K. and Germany. Additionally, in June 2024, we launched a limited market release in the U.S. of our Omnipod 5 app for iPhone compatible with Dexcom s G6 CGM, and in October we launched our U.S. full market release. 
 Finally, we continue to take steps to strengthen our global manufacturing capabilities. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we began producing sellable product at our newly constructed manufacturing plant in Malaysia. This plant provides us with increased capacity to satisfy our growing demand, supports our international expansion strategy, and is expected to drive higher gross margins over time. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 Our Pods are intended to be used continuously for up to three days, after which it may be replaced with a new disposable Pod. The unique patented design of the Omnipod allows us to provide Pod therapy at a relatively low or no up-front investment in regions where reimbursement allows for it and our pay-as-you-go pricing model reduces the risk to third-party payors. As we grow our customer base, we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenues through recurring sales of our disposable Pods, which provide recurring revenue. 
 Following our strategic decision to not move forward with the commercialization of Omnipod GO discussed above, we recorded a charge of 13.5 million related to certain inventory components that we no longer expect to utilize, which is included in our consolidated statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 We continue to experience challenges stemming from the global supply chain disruption; however, while there is no guarantee of future performance, to date we have been able to successfully mitigate this disruption and ensure uninterrupted supply to our customers by increasing our inventory levels and taking other measures. While our mitigation efforts and inflation have and are expected to continue to negatively impact gross margins and net income throughout the year, we intend to continue to work to improve productivity to help offset these costs.

 Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 111.2 million, or 25.7 , to 543.9 million, compared with 432.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 286.8 million, or 24.2 , to 1,474.1 million, compared with 1,187.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Constant currency revenue growth of 25.4 and 23.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, was primarily driven by higher volume largely attributable to our growing customer base and, to a lesser extent, higher price. 
 U.S. 
 Revenue from the sale of Omnipod products in the U.S. increased 75.0 million, or 23.4 , to 395.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 320.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase primarily resulted from higher volume driven by growing our customer base. To a lesser extent, the revenue increase was driven by a higher average selling price, due to a wholesale acquisition cost WAC increase implemented during the second quarter of 2024. Revenue from the sale of Omnipod products in the U.S. for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 171.3 million of related party revenue, compared with 112.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 59.3 million increase resulted from growth through the pharmacy channel. 
 Revenue from the sale of Omnipod products in the U.S. increased 209.2 million, or 24.4 , to 1,065.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 856.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase primarily resulted from higher volume through the pharmacy channel driven by growing our customer base, partially offset by a decrease in estimated inventory days-on-hand at distributors and lower conversions to Omnipod 5. Inventory days-on-hand declined to more normal levels following an acceleration of orders by U.S. pharmacy wholesalers in advance of the implementation of our new ERP system on January 1, 2024. We experienced a benefit from conversions to Omnipod 5 in the prior year following the launch of the product in the latter half of 2022 since users generally fill both their Omnipod 5 starter kit and their first month of refills simultaneously. Conversions to Omnipod 5 declined since the vast majority of U.S. conversions to Omnipod 5 occurred in 2023. To a lesser extent, the revenue increase was driven by a higher average selling price resulting from our annual WAC increases and growth in the pharmacy channel. Revenue from the sale of Omnipod products in the U.S. for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 430.4 million of related party revenue, compared with 318.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 112.4 million increase resulted from growth through the pharmacy channel. 
 For full year 2024, we expect strong U.S. revenue growth primarily driven by continued volume growth of Omnipod 5 due to an increase in our customer base and the benefits of our recurring revenue model, partially offset by a decrease in estimated inventory days-on-hand at distributors. A higher average selling price for Omnipod 5, resulting from our annual WAC increases and growth in the pharmacy channel, is also expected to contribute to the year over year increase in revenue.

 International 
 Revenue from the sale of Omnipod products in our international markets increased 36.6 million, or 36.1 , to 138.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 101.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the 1.3 favorable impact of currency exchange, the remaining 34.8 increase in revenue was primarily due to higher volumes from the launches of Omnipod 5 in the U.K. and Germany in the prior year, driven by our growing customer base and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of conversions to Omnipod 5 as users generally obtain both their starter kit and refills simultaneously. A higher average selling price for Omnipod 5, compared with Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod, also contributed to the revenue increase. 
 Revenue from the sale of Omnipod products in our international markets increased 77.7 million, or 25.6 , to 381.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 303.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the 0.9 favorable impact of currency exchange, the remaining 24.7 increase in revenue was primarily due to higher volumes from the launches of Omnipod 5 in the U.K. and Germany in the prior year, including the favorable impact of conversions to Omnipod 5. A higher average selling price for Omnipod 5 compared with Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod also contributed to the revenue increase, although to a lesser extent. 
 For full year 2024, we expect higher International Omnipod revenue due to continued volume growth driven by new customers and conversions to Omnipod 5 primarily due to the launches of Omnipod 5 in the U.K. and Germany in the prior year. 
 Drug Delivery 
 Substantially all of our Drug Delivery revenue consists of sales of pods to Amgen for use in the Neulasta Onpro kit, a delivery system for Amgen s Neulasta to help reduce the risk of infection after intense chemotherapy. 
 Drug Delivery revenue of 10.3 million and 27.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were level with the comparative prior year periods . An increase in orders from our partner during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was offset by a reimbursement from our partner to cover a portion of our increased production costs in the prior year, which did not repeat in the current year. For full year 2024, we expect Drug Delivery revenue to continue to approximate prior year.

 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 27.4 million, or 19.7 , to 166.8 million, compared with 139.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin was 69.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 67.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 150 basis point increase in gross margin was primarily driven by pricing benefits in both the U.S. pharmacy channel and in our international markets and improved manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by higher costs due to inflation. 
 Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 70.7 million, or 18.2 , to 459.3 million, compared with 388.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin was 68.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 67.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 150 basis point increase in gross margin was primarily driven by pricing benefits in both the U.S. pharmacy channel and in our international markets and improved manufacturing efficiencies. This increase was partially offset by a 13.5 million charge related to certain components utilized in Omnipod GO, which we decided not to commercialize, a 10.7 million accrual reversal during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 associated with the voluntary Medical Device Correction MDC notices we issued in 2022, which did not recur in the current period and higher costs due to inflation.

Table of Contents 

 For full year 2024, we expect gross margin to be approximately 69 . We anticipate gross margin to increase due to higher average selling prices and improved manufacturing efficiencies. These increases will be partially offset by the 13.5 million charge related to the discontinuance of Omnipod GO discussed above and 11.5 million of income in the prior year associated with a reduction to our MDC warranty accrual, which will not recur in the current year. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses of 54.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were relatively level with the three months ended September 30, 2023. Research and development expenses as a percent of revenue declined to 10.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 13.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in sustaining costs following the launch of Omnipod 5 in the United States and Europe, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 Research and development expenses of 159.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were relatively level with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Research and development expenses as a percent of revenue declined to 10.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 13.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in sustaining costs following the launch of Omnipod 5 in the United States and Europe, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 53.4 million, or 29.6 , to 234.1 million, compared with 180.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to year-over-year headcount additions to support commercial and international growth, to sustain Omnipod 5 and due to a 15.9 million increase in advertising expense. To a lesser extent, the increase was a result of our new organizational structure that is designed to accelerate innovation and commercialization and higher legal fees. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 134.1 million, or 25.7 , to 656.2 million, compared with 522.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to year-over-year headcount additions to support commercial and international growth and sustain Omnipod 5 and as a result of our new organizational structure. To a lesser extent, the increase was due to an 18.9 million increase in advertising expense, higher legal fees to support our business growth, and higher costs associated with the continued commercial rollout of Omnipod 5 in international markets. 
 We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2024 compared with 2023 due to investments in our operating structure, primarily headcount additions, particularly in the areas of sales and engineering, to facilitate continued growth. We also plan to make additional investments to support the Omnipod platform, including market acceptance, access and awareness, as well as to support the phased launch of Omnipod 5 in our international markets and to defend our intellectual property. 
 Non-Operating Items 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.9 million to 12.3 million, compared with 10.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4.5 million to 34.0 million, compared with 29.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to fees paid to amend our Term Loan. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.9 million to 10.5 million, compared with 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.8 million to 29.2 million, compared with 22.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily driven by increased average cash balances and higher interest rates. 
 Other (Expense) Income, net 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, other expense, net was 3.4 million and 5.9 million, respectively, compared with other income, net of 0.7 million and 0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense for the current periods was primarily driven by a 2.0 million and 3.8 million loss during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, resulting from fair value adjustments for a strategic debt investment.

 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit 
 Our effective tax rate was 6.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 3.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to changes in the distribution of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate and a corresponding reduction in available net operating loss carryforwards to reduce taxable income, partially offset by a 12.1 million non-cash tax benefit related to the valuation allowance release and a 2.7 million discrete tax benefit associated with a U.S. federal research and development tax credit recovery project for tax years 2017 through 2022. 
 Our effective tax rate was a benefit of 68.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with expense of 3.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to a 165.6 million non-cash tax benefit from releasing the majority of our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and a 7.5 million discrete tax benefit associated with the research and development tax credit recovery project discussed above. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable may change if estimates of future taxable income are revised. Refer to Note 15 for additional information regarding the release of our valuation allowance. 
 In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD and G20 international forum released the Model Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules Model Rules under Pillar Two. These Model Rules set forth the common approach for a Global Minimum Tax at 15 for multinational enterprises with revenue greater than 750 million and is expected to be applicable to Insulet. Pillar Two has been adopted by the Council of the European Union for implementation by European Union member states by December 31, 2023, with effect for tax years beginning 2024. Similar directives under Pillar Two are already adopted or expected to be adopted by taxing authorities in other countries where Insulet has business operations, with widespread implementation of the Global Minimum Tax in calendar years 2024 and 2025. While we do not expect the Pillar Two Model Rules and related legislation to have a significant impact on our financial statements for 2024, we continue to evaluate their potential impact on future years.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Management uses the non-GAAP financial measures described below. 
 Constant currency revenue growth represents the change in revenue between current and prior year periods using the exchange rate in effect during the applicable prior year period. We present constant currency revenue growth because we believe it provides meaningful information regarding our results on a consistent and comparable basis. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to financial measures in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate our operating results. It is also one of the performance metrics that determines management incentive compensation. 
 Adjusted EBITDA represents net income plus net interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other significant transactions or events, such as legal settlements, medical device corrections, gains (losses) on investments, and loss on extinguishment of debt, that affect the period-to-period comparability of our performances, as applicable. We present Adjusted EBITDA because management uses it as a supplemental measure in assessing our performance, and we believe that it is helpful to investors and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative performance from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA is a commonly used measure in determining business value and we use it internally to report results.

 Summary of Cash Flows 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 282.6 100.5 Investing activities (78.2) (87.8) Financing activities (7.2) (15.8) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 
 1.2 (1.2) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 198.4 (4.3) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 282.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to net income, as adjusted for deferred income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and a 17.7 million working capital outflow. The working capital outflow was driven by a 38.6 million increase in inventories, a 16.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and a 14.9 million increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by a 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 32.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities and a 20.0 million increase in accounts payable. The increase in inventories was primarily due to a planned inventory build to satisfy our growing demand and, to a lesser extent, to mitigate supply chain risk. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily driven by an increase in prepaid income taxes, cloud computing implementation costs and capitalized commissions. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in sales driven by our growing customer base. The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in accrued rebates due to higher revenue subject to pharmacy rebates and an increase in direct-to-consumer advertising spend, partially offset by the annual payout of cash bonuses for performance in the prior year. Finally, the increase in accounts payable was driven by the timing of payments. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 78.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 87.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Capital Spending Capital expenditures were 71.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 46.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 25.0 million increase primarily related to the purchase of machinery, equipment and tooling to increase our manufacturing capacity for our new Malaysia manufacturing facility and continuous improvements at our other owned manufacturing facility. We expect capital expenditures for 2024 to increase compared with 2023 given the timing of spending on machinery, equipment and tooling for our new Malaysia manufacturing facility, as well as the purchase of land and manufacturing facility in Malaysia. We also expect capital expenditure to increase due to investments in our information technology infrastructure and continuous improvements at our other owned manufacturing facility. We expect to fund our capital expenditures using existing cash. 
 Investments in Developed Software Investments in developed software were 6.7 million and 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and primarily related to investments in projects to support our cloud-based capabilities. 
 Acquisitions and Investments During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid Bigfoot Biomedical, Inc. 25.1 million, including transaction costs, to acquire patent assets related to pump-based AID technologies. We also paid a purchase price holdback of 3.0 million associated with our 2022 acquisition of substantially all the assets related to the manufacture and production of shape-memory alloy wire assemblies used in the production of our product from Dynalloy, Inc. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made strategic investments in private companies in the amount of 7.2 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 15.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Debt Issuance and Repayments During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we refinanced our Term Loan, which resulted in cash proceeds of 130.0 million, net of issuance costs, and the simultaneous repayment of 132.2 million of the Term Loan. Refer to Note 9 for more information regarding this refinancing. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made 21.1 million in aggregate principal payments on our equipment financings, Term Loan, and mortgage, compared with 20.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Proceeds and Repayments from Secured Borrowing During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 32.6 million of cash advances from a third-party to whom we outsource our insurance claim submissions process in a certain country. Additionally, we repaid 17.2 million of cash advances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Finance Lease Repayments During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made 6.0 million in finance lease repayments associated with our Malaysia manufacturing facility. 
 Proceeds from Option Exercises and Shares Issued Under Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") Total proceeds from option exercises and issuance of shares under the ESPP were 13.7 million and 17.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 4.2 million decrease was primarily driven by option exercises by former executives in the prior year. 
 Payment of Taxes for Restricted Stock Net Settlements Payments for taxes related to net restricted and performance stock unit settlements were 7.0 million and 13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 6.1 million decrease was primarily driven by a lower fair market value of the restricted stock units that vested during the period. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 19.2 million of letters of credit outstanding, primarily under our 20.0 million uncommitted letter of credit facility to backstop bank guarantees for the same amount. The bank guarantees primarily serve as security for our newly constructed manufacturing building in Malaysia until we purchase the property. We pay interest on outstanding borrowings and commitment fees on the maximum amount available to be drawn under the letters of credit at a rate of between 1.65 and 2.25 , depending on our credit rating. The letters of credit include customary covenants, none of which are considered restrictive to our operations. We had letters of credit outstanding totaling 20.9 million as of December 31, 2023.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 
 Our accounting policies for revenue recognition, income taxes, product warranty and inventory reserves are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. There have been no significant changes to the above critical accounting policies or in the underlying accounting assumptions and estimates used in such policies from those disclosed in our annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Accounting Standards Issued and Not Yet Adopted 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . ASU 2023-07 requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis, including enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. We are required to comply with these new disclosure requirements beginning with our annual filing for 2024. The guidance is applied retrospectively. We do not plan to early adopt ASU 2023-07. ASU 2023-07 is not expected to impact the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09 includes improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to information about rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The new guidance requires disclosure of specific categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and adds a requirement to disaggregate income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The new guidance also requires disclosure of pretax income disaggregated between domestic and foreign, income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign, and removes certain existing disclosure requirements. We are required to comply with these new disclosure requirements beginning with our annual filing for 2025. The guidance may be applied on a prospective basis or retrospective basis. We do not plan to early adopt the requirements of ASU 2023-09. ASU 2023-09 is not expected to impact the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) . ASU 2024-03 requires disclosure, in the notes to the financial statements, of specified information about certain costs and expenses, including amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization included in each relevant expense caption, as well as a qualitative description of amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. ASU 2024-03 also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual periods, an entity s definition of selling expenses. We are required to comply with these new disclosure requirements beginning with our annual filing for 2027. The guidance may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. We do not plan to early adopt ASU 2024-03. ASU 2024-03 is not expected to impact the Company s financial position or results of operations.

 The risk factors discussed in Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in this Quarterly Report could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. In addition, there may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements; accordingly, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements other than as required by law. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Refer to Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of our interest rate, market price sensitive instruments and foreign currency exchange risk. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act ), as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation, our chief executive officer (principal executive officer) and chief financial officer (principal financial officer) concluded that, as of that date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness identified in the fourth quarter of 2023 described below.

 Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 As previously disclosed in "Part II. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, due to a material weakness relating to information technology general controls ITGCs ). Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain effective ITGCs around systems that support the Company s financial reporting outside of North America. Automated and manual business process controls that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely affected to the extent that they rely upon information and configurations from the affected systems. 
 Remediation Activities 
 Management has been actively engaged in remediating the deficiencies described above. The following remedial actions were taken during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Evaluated the design of ITGCs that have been implemented by an outsourced provider, and 
 Implemented enhanced procedures related to security access controls over the Company s enterprise resource planning ERP system. 
 Management believes that these actions will remediate the material weakness; however, the material weakness will not be considered remediated until management has concluded that these controls are operating effectively. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
