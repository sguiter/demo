The Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of September 30, 2024. A significant portion of the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due to a one-time contractual commitment for marketing spend on a theatrical release, legal expenses related to unfavorable outcome of arbitration and increased marketing expenses to grow Angel Guild memberships.

The Company will negotiate the terms of the theatrical distribution window (ranging from a few weeks to a few months), profit sharing percentage, and collection terms with the theater owners prior to the release.

Content Licensing The Company s content licensing arrangements include fixed fee and minimum guarantee arrangements, and sales or usage based royalties. The Company s fixed fee or minimum guarantee licensing arrangements may, in some cases, include multiple titles, multiple license periods (windows), rights to exploitation in different media, or rights to exploitation in multiple territories, which may be considered distinct performance obligations. When these performance obligations are considered distinct, the fixed fee or minimum guarantee in the arrangement is allocated to the title, window, media right or territory as applicable, based on estimates of relative standalone selling prices. The amounts related to each performance obligation (i.e., title, window, media or territory) are recognized when the content has been delivered, and the window for the exploitation right in that territory has begun, which is the point in time at which the customer is able to begin to use and benefit from the content. Sales or usage based royalties represent amounts due to us based on the sale or usage of the Company s content by the customer, and revenues are recognized at the later of when the subsequent sale or usage occurs, or the performance obligation to which some or all the sales or usage-based royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Generally, when the Company licenses completed content (with standalone functionality, such as a movie, or television show), its performance obligation will be satisfied prior to the sale or usage. The actual amounts due to the Company under these arrangements are typically not reported to the Company until several months after the close of the reporting period. The Company records revenue under these arrangements for the amounts due and not yet reported to the Company based on estimates of the sales or usage of these customers and pursuant to the terms of the contracts. Such estimates are based on information from the Company s customers, historical experience with similar titles in that market or territory, the performance of the title in other markets and/or available data in the industry. While the Company believes these estimates are reasonable estimates of the amounts due under these arrangements, such estimated amounts could differ from the actual amounts to be subsequently reported by the customer, which could be higher or lower than the Company s estimates, and could result in an adjustment to revenues in future periods. Any adjustments booked during the September 30, 2024 and 2023 periods have been immaterial.

The revenue participation rights allow Angel P A the right to receive an amount not to exceed (initial investment plus a return) of their invested amount. Angel P A has priority on the cash receipts to the Company of the particular film they invested in and shall be paid in full before any other claims, with the exception of crowdfunding P A raised (if any) which would take first priority, from the film are paid. An initial draw of million took place in March 2024 and was paid back in June 2024 along with the return. A draw of million was made in July 2024 and paid back in September 2024 along with the return. Once Angel P A receives the repayment on these notes, the interest portion will be distributed to the institutional investors and the original investment can either remain at Angel P A for additional P A loans needed by the Company or be returned to the institutional investors until the Company has further need of the funds. The commitment period between Angel P A and the Company, and between Angel P A and the investors, lasts through February 2027. Angel P A has employees and is not anticipated to incur any operating expenses.

Overview We were founded in 2013 by our Chief Executive Officer, Neal Harmon, along with his brothers Daniel, Jeffrey and Jordan, and their cousin, Benton Crane. We are a values-based distribution company for stories that amplify light to mainstream audiences. As of November 4, 2024, through the Angel Guild, over 450,000 members from more than 150 different countries help decide what film and television projects ASI will market and distribute. With over 124,000 individual investments, more than 93,000 early investors have invested over 103.0 million in ASI or projects distributed by ASI as of September 11, 2024. ASI believes, based on current growth trajectories, that the Angel Guild will reach 1 million members in 2025. Defining Determining Light To determine whether or not a film or television show should be released, we screen a short promotional version, or, if available, a full-length feature or episode, to a sample of members of the Angel Guild who vote on whether the project amplifies light. We define light as anything that is true, honest, noble, just, authentic, lovely, admirable, and excellent. The Angel Guild The Angel Guild is a community of interested individuals who have invested in our previous films or television shows, and individuals who pay a monthly or annual fee to us to be a member of the Angel Guild. Upon watching a Torch, which is a concept video preview, Angel Guild members are asked for their feedback as to whether or not the Torch amplifies light, and their feedback is used to determine whether we will move forward with production and/or distribution of the film or television show. We primarily generate revenue from the following sources: Angel Guild revenue comes from monthly or annual membership fees. Currently there are two possible tiers for membership, Basic and Premium. Both memberships allow voting for every ASI release, give early access for streaming, and help fund our

Table of Contents 
 original films, increasing new content releases. The primary difference between the two memberships is that Premium includes two complimentary tickets to every ASI theatrical release and a discount for all merchandise. Theatrical Distribution revenue comes from releasing our original films with our exhibitor partners. Every time a moviegoer purchases a ticket from the partner theaters, we receive a percentage of the box office revenue. For most international theaters, the percentage of box office revenue is first paid to a distributor who then pays us. Content Licensing revenue comes from licensing our films and television shows to other distributors such as Amazon, Apple, and Netflix. Our future plans include licensing the rights to our films and television shows for other experiences such as derivative shows, video games, theme parks and Broadway-style plays. Merchandise revenue is generated from sales of merchandise related to our films and series, as well as physical DVD sales. We also offer a direct online store for ASI themed products and wholesale products to retail partners. 
 Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Seeking to Empower the Angel Guild for Generations As of October 15, 2024, we held an aggregate of approximately 300 bitcoin. We plan to continue to acquire and hold bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset as an adjunct to our core film and television production and distribution business. The continued implementation of this bitcoin reserve is intended to support our mission-driven approach. Our bitcoin treasury is a for-profit endowment for the arts based on the bitcoin standard that seeks to build a financial foundation to fund the world s best filmmakers to produce stories that amplify light for generations to come. On September 30, 2024, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Off the Chain, a leading bitcoin asset management firm, pursuant to which Off the Chain purchased an aggregate of 330,687 shares of Class C Common Stock, at a price of 30.24 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of 10.0 million, payable in bitcoin. The sale closed on October 10, 2024. The issuance of the Class C Common Stock was made in reliance upon exemptions from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Off the Chain is an accredited investor as defined in Regulation D, and the sale of the Class C Common Stock was made without general solicitation or advertising. No commissions were paid in connection with the sale of such securities. Regulation A Offering On September 10, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 661,375 shares of Class C Common Stock, pursuant to an offering under Regulation A of Section 3(6) of the Securities Act. The offering was conducted pursuant to our offering statement on Form 1-A, originally filed with the SEC on June 20, 2024, as subsequently amended and filed with the SEC on each of August 9, 2024 and August 27, 2024, and as qualified by the SEC on August 29, 2024. The price of the Class C Common Stock was 30.24 per share, for gross proceeds of approximately 20.0 million. No selling commissions were paid in connection with the sale of these shares of the Class C Common Stock. Certain of our executive officers and directors participated in the offering. Recent Developments On September 11, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement by and among Southport, Sigma Merger Sub, Inc. and us.

Financial Operations Overview Revenues Historically, we have primarily generated revenue from the Angel Guild, theatrical distribution, content licensing and merchandise. See The Angel Guild for more information. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues represents the direct costs incurred by us in generating our revenue. These costs include expenses directly associated with the goods or services sold during the reporting period. Components of cost of revenues include licensing royalty expense, hosting, merchandise costs, credit card fees, freight and shipping costs and costs of services provided. Operating Expenses Selling and Marketing: Selling and marketing expenses include the promotion of the Angel Guild and increasing memberships, as well as current and future theatrical releases. As we continue to bring on additional content, drive Angel Guild memberships and promote future theatrical releases, this cost is expected to continue to rise.

For the three months ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 Guild 9,028,572 293,812 8,734,760 2,973 Theatrical 4,939,612 98,275,037 (93,335,425) (95) Content licensing 1,947,539 2,501,303 (553,764) (22) Theatrical Pay it Forward 1,326,039 3,430,855 (2,104,816) (61) Physical media 1,325,643 3,549,611 (2,223,968) (63) Digital 906,949 352,975 553,974 157 Pay it Forward 378,628 4,359,604 (3,980,976) (91) Other 268,184 258,957 9,227 4 Total Revenue 20,121,166 113,022,154 (92,900,988) (82) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in revenues was due to several factors: 1) Pay it Forward revenue decreased by 4.0 million as a result of transitioning away from Pay it Forward and focusing more on the Angel Guild; 2) Theatrical Pay it Forward revenue decreased by 2.1 million as a result of less theatrical Pay it Forward collected in excess of ticket redemptions; 3) Theatrical Release revenue decreased by 93.3 million as a result of the Sound of Freedom movie that was released in Q3 2023 with no comparable blockbusters being released by us in 2024, 4) Physical Media sales decreased by 2.2 million as sales have not been as strong during 2024 when compared to 2023. These decreases were offset by an increase in Angel Guild revenue of 8.7 million. Operating Expenses Our cost of revenues decreased during the third quarter of 2024 as a result of decreased licensing and royalty costs. Sales and marketing expense decreased as a result of a significant decrease in spending for theatrical advertising, however we have continued to increase spending specific to the Angel Guild as we focus on increasing memberships. As we continue to bring on additional content, drive Angel Guild memberships, and promote future theatrical releases, this cost is expected to fluctuate, but overall remain high and be a significant component of our operating expenses. Lower general and administrative and research and development costs were largely related to a decrease in workforce and becoming more efficient as we continue our focus on improving existing products, optimizing existing services, and developing new technology to better meet the needs of our customers and partners. The increase in legal expenses was largely a result of legal costs associated with The Chosen arbitration and estimated liabilities as a result of the outcome of the arbitration, expected higher legal costs due to the proposed Business Combination, public reporting and planned acquisitions. For more information, see Part II Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings. The gain on digital assets in 2024 is a result of selling a portion of our digital assets for a price higher than the book value. The decrease in interest expense is related to a lower amount of print and advertising notes entered into and outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income is the result of a more favorable rate environment for cash deposits, and from our cash reserves being moved to higher interest-bearing accounts during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

These decreases were offset by 1) an increase in Angel Guild revenue of 20.1 million as the Angel Guild did not launch until the second quarter of 2023 and our membership base has increased; 2) an increases in content licensing revenue of 7.3 million as we continue to work with more partners who license our content, and 3) transactional video on demand and electronic sell thru revenue increased by 1.3 million as a result of increased content being offered for sale or rental. Operating Expenses Our cost of revenues decreased during 2024 as a result of decreased licensing and royalty costs. The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to the promotion of the Angel Guild and increasing memberships, as well as current and future theatrical releases. As we continue to bring on additional content, drive Angel Guild memberships, and promote future theatrical releases, this cost is expected to fluctuate, but overall remain high and be a significant component of our operating expenses.

 Higher general and administrative costs were related to the support staff necessary to manage the continued and expected growth of the business, while higher research and development costs were due to the addition of personnel necessary to continue our focus on improving existing products, optimizing existing services, and developing new technology to better meet the needs of our customers and partners. During the second quarter of 2024, we had decrease in workforce to lower our costs as we continue our focus on improving existing products, optimizing existing services, and developing new technology to better meet the needs of our customers and partners.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating and Capital Expenditure Requirements 

As of Change September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 2024 vs. 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 11,343,602 25,201,425 (13,857,823) (55) Accrued settlement costs 4,437,813 4,625,854 (188,041) (4) Notes payable 3,168,729 4,160,277 (991,548) (24) Cash and cash equivalents decreased 13.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to cash used in operating activities of 40.1 million offset by the net proceeds of issuance of Common Stock of 26.7 million. To date, we have funded a significant portion of our operations through private and public offerings of Common Stock and raise of money through notes payable. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash on hand of approximately 11.3 million. We have accrued settlement costs in the amount of 4.4 million, payable over forty remaining equal quarterly installments of 0.2 million. The expense was recorded at the present value of the obligation with an imputed interest rate of 10 . The short-term obligation related to these settlement costs as of September 30, 2024 was 0.3 million and the long-term portion is 4.2 million. We also had notes payable for print and advertising notes in the amount of 3.2 million with amounts due based on timing of certain cash proceeds, but which amounts are expected to be paid within the next 12 months. As we continue to grow, we expect to raise additional funds to cover any shortfall in operating needs. We project that our existing capital resources, including cash, accounts receivables, licensing receivables, and the ability to sell our digital assets if necessary, will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern within one year from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of approximately 51.3 million and used cash in operating activities of approximately 40.1 million. We have an accumulated deficit of approximately 61.3 million as of September 30, 2024. A significant portion of the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due to a one-time contractual commitment for marketing spend on a theatrical release, legal expenses related to unfavorable outcome of arbitration and increased marketing expenses to grow Angel Guild memberships. Management does not anticipate the same level of marketing spend as a percentage of revenue for future theatrical releases. The Chosen Agreement, which has generated significant past revenues, was canceled during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Management anticipates that we will continue to incur operating losses and use cash in operating activities for the rest of 2024 and into 2025. Management is working to increase revenues through the growth of Angel Guild memberships, our pipeline of theatrical releases in the second half of 2024 and in 2025, and additional streaming agreements. We hold bitcoin assets valued at over 20.0 million as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We finance marketing activities for theatrical releases through print and advertising loan agreements with individual and institutional investors. Additionally, we have raised capital through the sale of Common Stock, 

 23 

Table of Contents 
 generating approximately 7.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, and approximately 26.7 million during nine months ended September 30, 2024. Management believes it will be able to fund operating capital shortfalls for the next year through the issuance of debt and common stock. While there is no assurance of success, management remains committed to its plans to grow revenues and manage expenses. If these efforts are not successful, or if securing debt and selling Common Stock on acceptable terms proves challenging, we would need to significantly reduce operations, which could materially affect our financial condition and/or our ability to continue as a going concern. Discussion of Operating, Investing, Financing Cash Flows Operating Activities. Cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were as follows: 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net Change Net cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in) operating activities (40,082,027) 19,422,221 (59,504,248) Cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 40.1 million compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of 19.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2024, compared to 2023, is due largely to the net loss generated during this period, higher outstanding licensing receivables due to increased licensing revenues, a significant paydown of accrued expenses and accrued licensing royalties and a change in deferred income taxes of 4.4 million. These were offset by an increase in cash collect from accounts receivable and a higher deferred revenue balance as a result of more monthly and annual memberships to the Angel Guild. Investing Activities. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were as follows: 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net Change Purchases of property and equipment (271,927) (386,311) 114,384 Issuance of note receivable (1,455,279) (2,042,255) 586,976 Collections of note receivable 1,820,313 3,669,396 (1,849,083) Purchase of digital assets (48,515) (76,966) 28,451 Sale of digital assets 2,182,381 2,182,381 Investments in affiliates (1,033,516) (770,391) (263,125) Net cash and cash equivalents provided by investing activities 1,193,457 393,473 799,984 Cash flows provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.2 million compared to cash flows provided by investing activities 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Both periods saw moderate activity in issuing and collecting repayments on notes receivable, with more collections during 2023 being the result of several of our filmmakers paying us back for our crowdfunding services during each period (see section Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Notes Receivable ). We also sold some of our digital assets, which resulted in a gain of 1.6 million, during the 2024 period.

 Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were as follows: 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net Change Repayment of notes payable (18,562,356) (26,775,579) 8,213,223 Receipt of notes payable 17,043,019 24,710,485 (7,667,466) Exercise of stock options 457,820 39,258 418,562 Issuance of common stock 26,901,019 7,500,000 19,401,019 Fees related to issuance of common stock (206,613) (206,613) Repurchase of common stock (600,079) (21,922) (578,157) Debt financing fees (305,271) 305,271 Net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities 25,032,810 5,146,971 19,885,839 Cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 25.0 million compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the 2024 period, we raised 31.6 million with issuance of Common Stock, with 4.9 million of this amount collected in October and November 2024, and 17.0 million for print and advertising related activities and repaid 18.6 million for print and advertising related activities during the same period. During the 2023 period, we raised 7.5 million with issuance of Common Stock and 24.7 million for print and advertising related activities and repaid 26.8 million for print and advertising related activities during the same period. Trends and Key Factors Affecting Our Performance Our business does not currently generate revenue from distribution activities related to the Chosen Agreement. Revenue from distribution activities related to the Chosen Agreement has accounted for 10 and 22 of our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. On April 4, 2023, The Chosen initiated a private binding arbitration against us alleging certain material breaches of contract under the Chosen Agreement, seeking to terminate the Chosen Agreement pursuant to which we were granted a limited license to distribute, solely on the Angel App, all previous and future episodes and seasons of the television series The Chosen, and any future audiovisual productions derivatives thereof. On May 28, 2024, the arbitrator in the arbitration proceedings issued an Interim Arbitration Award (the Interim Arbitration Award granting The Chosen s breach of contract claims and terminating the Chosen Agreement effective as of May 28, 2024. The Interim Arbitration Award granted The Chosen monetary damages in the amount of 30.0 thousand, plus costs and potential recovery of an allocable portion of its attorney fees. The Interim Arbitration Award denied in full The Chosen s claims for the remedies of disgorgement of profits and corrective advertising. On September 25, 2024, the Final Arbitration Award (the Final Arbitration Award was issued, which remained consistent with the Interim Arbitration Award and granted a portion of The Chosen s costs and fees. We disagree with the arbitrator s decision regarding the breach of contract claims and the termination of the Chosen Agreement and intend to seek appellate review of the Final Arbitration Award in the arbitration proceedings, as permitted under the arbitration provision of the Chosen Agreement. Unless and until a favorable outcome of such appellate review is determined, we will fully comply with the Final Arbitration Award, including with respect to the termination of the Chosen Agreement effective as of May 28, 2024. We have worked with other filmmakers that have generated a substantial amount of revenue for us. We are continuing to work with these and several other filmmakers on new and exciting films and TV shows. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to earn as much revenue from these new films and TV shows as we have from some of our more successful films and TV shows, including The Chosen. If we are unable to successfully monetize other projects, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our ability to monetize the content we distribute is heavily reliant on factors currently outside of our control, including, but not limited to, the potential loss of key talent, the potential for budget overruns, the quality of the content produced, the timeliness of the production and subsequent release schedule, and the relationship of the creator with the audience. If we are unable to find ways to mitigate the risks associated with these external factors, it may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The SEC has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Long-lived Assets Intangible assets with finite lives and property, plant and equipment are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. We monitor conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization or depreciation period. We test these assets for potential impairment whenever our management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The original estimate of an asset s useful life and the impact of an event or circumstance on either an asset s useful life or carrying value involve significant judgment regarding estimates of the future cash flows associated with each asset. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method, whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets when we expect the amount of tax benefit to be realized is less than the carrying value of the deferred tax asset. Accounting for income taxes involves uncertainty and judgment on how to interpret and apply tax laws and regulations within our annual tax filings. Such uncertainties from time to time may result in a tax position that may be challenged and overturned by a tax authority in the future which could result in additional tax liability, interest charges and possibly penalties. Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation by measuring and recognizing as compensation expense the fair value of all share-based payment awards made to employees based on estimated grant date fair values. The determination of fair value involves a number of significant estimates. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model or the Monte Carlo pricing model to estimate the value of employee stock options which requires a number of assumptions to determine the model inputs. These include the expected volatility of our stock and employee exercise behavior which are based on historical data as well as expectations of future developments over the term of the option. As stock-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Management s estimate of forfeitures is based on historical experience but actual forfeitures could differ materially as a result of voluntary employee actions and involuntary actions which would result in significant change in our stock-based compensation expense amounts in the future. The fair value of the Common Stock underlying the employee stock options is estimated using third party valuations, including market, income, and cost valuation approaches. Other Estimates See Note 1 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including changes in interest rates. Historically, fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant impact on our operating results. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding variable rate indebtedness, and we have not utilized any derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts, options and swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts or interest rate swaps and futures. In addition, any sales we make that are denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates. These risks include the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls and potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved. Overall, we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate changes is not material to our financial condition or results of operations. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of September 30, 2024, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in this report filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. We believe, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We currently are, and from time to time might again become, involved in litigation. Litigation has the potential to cause us to incur unexpected losses, some of which might not be covered by insurance but can materially affect our financial condition and our ability to continue business operations. Disney Litigation and the Preliminary Injunction On December 12, 2016, the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the California Court ), in the matter of Disney Enterprises, Inc.; Lucasfilm Ltd., LLC; Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation and Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc., or Plaintiffs, v. VidAngel (the Disney Litigation ), granted the Plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction, against us. On October 5, 2017, the California Court allowed the Plaintiffs to amend the original complaint to add three (3) of their subsidiaries, MVL Film Finance LLC, New Line Productions, Inc., and Turner Entertainment Co., as additional Plaintiffs (collectively, the Plaintiffs ), and identify additional motion pictures as having allegedly been infringed. The Plaintiffs claimed that we unlawfully decrypted and infringed 819 titles in total. On March 6, 2019, the California Court granted the Plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment as to liability. The order found that we were liable for infringing the copyrights, and violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA ), with respect to certain motion pictures of the Plaintiffs . Damages related to the respective copyright infringements, and DMCA violations, were decided by a jury trial in June 2019. The jury found that we willfully infringed the Plaintiffs copyrights and awarded statutory damages of 75.0 thousand for each of the 819 infringed titles, or 61.4 million. The jury also awarded statutory damages of 1.3 thousand for DMCA violations for each of the 819 infringed titles, or 1.0 million. The total award for both counts was 62.4 million. On September 23, 2019, a judgment consistent with the jury s verdict was entered against us by the California Court. The Plaintiffs also planned to seek an award of costs and attorneys fees. On August 26, 2020, we entered into a Settlement Agreement (the Disney Settlement Agreement with the Plaintiffs as part of our Reorganization Plan (as defined below), effectively ending the litigation. See Chapter 11 Bankruptcy below, for more information on the Disney Settlement Agreement and Reorganization Plan. The Permanent Injunction On September 5, 2019, the California Court issued a permanent injunction against us. The permanent injunction enjoins us, our officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, from: (1) circumventing technological measures protecting Plaintiffs Copyrighted Works (as defined in the Disney Settlement Agreement) on DVDs, Blu-rays, or any other medium; (2) copying Plaintiffs Copyrighted Works, including but not limited to copying the works onto computers or servers; (3) streaming, transmitting or otherwise publicly performing any of Plaintiffs Copyrighted Works over the internet, via web applications, via portable devices, via streaming devices, or by means of any other device or process; or (4) engaging in any other activity that violates, directly or indirectly, Plaintiffs anti-circumvention right, 17 U.S.C. 1201(a), or that infringes by any means, directly or indirectly, any of Plaintiffs exclusive rights in any copyrighted work under Section 106 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 106. We were required to cease and have ceased filtering and streaming all movies and television programs owned by the Plaintiffs. The foregoing description of the permanent injunction is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the California Court s orders. Chapter 11 Bankruptcy On October 18, 2017, we filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11, title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Utah (the Bankruptcy Court ), case number 17-29073 (the Bankruptcy Case ). On September 4, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed our Joint Plan of Reorganization (the Reorganization Plan ), which became effective on September 30, 2020 (the Reorganization Plan Effective Date ). On November 17, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court issued a final decree closing the Bankruptcy Case. The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Reorganization Plan and related Disney Settlement Agreement, and is not intended to be a complete description of the Reorganization Plan. Complete versions of the Reorganization Plan and related Disney

 Settlement Agreement can be found in the section entitled Exhibits under Item 2.1 of our Form 1-U filed with the SEC on September 15, 2020 , and are incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Reorganization Plan The Reorganization Plan, as confirmed, contemplated that: We will continue as a going concern, thereby ensuring the greatest return to creditors and shareholders by allowing us to reorganize through continuation of its business operations and satisfaction and discharge of its debts over time. Holders of all allowed claims (other than administrative expense claims and priority tax claims) Claim Holders will be paid in full, from funds available and required to be distributed thereto Distribution Funds ), and the holders of equity interests in us Equity Holders shall retain their interests in us. Neal Harmon and Jeffrey Harmon will remain in management positions with us and agreed to refrain from engaging in competitive activities in the business of Self-Selected Viewing for a one-year period. Pursuant to the Disney Settlement Agreement and under the related security agreement and compliance lien, Neal Harmon and Jeffrey Harmon pledged all their equity in us as collateral. If we are found to have four instances of unauthorized use of copyrighted materials in a consecutive five-year period, any Studio (as defined below) may immediately commence an enforcement action against us in the Central District of California, and both Neal Harmon and Jeffrey Harmon could lose all of their interests in us. We agree not to directly or indirectly, or facilitate any third party, to descramble, decrypt or otherwise bypass a Copyrighted Work of Disney Enterprises, Inc., Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC, Twentieth Century Film Corporation, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., MVL Film Finance, LLC, New Line Productions, Inc., and Turner Entertainment Co. (each individually a Studio and collectively, the Studios or their respective affiliates, not to reproduce such a Copyrighted Work, not to stream, transmit, or publicly perform such a Copyrighted Work, and not to distribute such a Copyrighted Work. We agree not to sue the Studios, and not to use resources to lobby to amend the Family Movie Act (17 U.S.C. 110(11)) for a period of fourteen years following the Reorganization Plan Effective Date. We will voluntarily dismiss its appeal of the judgment and the injunction obtained by the Studios. Subject to our compliance with terms and conditions of the Reorganization Plan and related Disney Settlement Agreement, we will pay the Studios 9.9 million over fourteen years, without interest, provided, however, that the unpaid balance of that certain promissory note made by the Company to the Studios in the amount of 62.5 million (the Note minus any paid amounts (the Settlement Amount will remain outstanding for fourteen years from the Reorganization Plan Effective Date. If, upon the expiration of fourteen years after the Reorganization Plan Effective Date, the Settlement Amount is timely paid and there is no breach or violation of the Disney Settlement Agreement that remains uncured after written notice is received and there have not been four instances of unpermitted conduct in violation of the Disney Settlement Agreement, subject to a Notice of Default (as defined in the Disney Settlement Agreement), in a consecutive five year period, then the Note shall be cancelled, and the original Note marked Paid and Cancelled shall be returned to us. The Equity Holders shall retain their equity interests in us, provided however, that distributions to such Equity Holders shall not be made unless and until all payment obligations under the Reorganization Plan are made in full. 
 ClearPlay Litigation In 2014, we responded to a contention by ClearPlay that we (at such time, VidAngel) infringed on certain ClearPlay patents by suing ClearPlay in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the case was later transferred to Utah). In doing so, we requested judicial determinations that our technology and service did not infringe eight patents owned by ClearPlay and that the patents were invalid. In turn, ClearPlay counterclaimed against us, alleging patent infringement. On February 17, 2015, the case was stayed pending inter partes review by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO ), of several of ClearPlay s patents. We were not party to or involved in the USPTO s review of those patents. Owing to those proceedings, on May 29, 2015, the Utah trial court closed the case without prejudice to the parties rights to reassert any or all claims later. In July and August 2015, many of ClearPlay s patent claims, including many of the claims asserted against us, were invalidated by the USPTO. Some of ClearPlay s other patent claims were upheld and still others were never challenged in the USPTO. Following the USPTO s rulings, ClearPlay appealed some of the USPTO s invalidity decisions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The findings of invalidity were all affirmed by the Federal Circuit on August 16, 2016. On October 31, 2016, the magistrate judge, Brooke C. Wells, conducted telephonic status conferences in this and a related case brought by ClearPlay against DISH Network and ordered that both cases be re-

 opened. Subsequently, Magistrate Judge Wells granted ClearPlay s motion to stay the litigation at least until a decision is rendered on the preliminary injunction by the Ninth Circuit. On October 12, 2017, the magistrate judge ordered the case stayed again, this time until a final decision is rendered in the Disney Litigation. On February 14, 2018, ClearPlay filed a claim in our chapter 11 proceeding seeking an unliquidated sum. On April 14, 2020, the trustee appointed in our Bankruptcy Case filed an objection to the claim in the Bankruptcy Court seeking an order to disallow the claim in its entirety. On October 21, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order converting the trustee s objection to ClearPlay s claim in the Bankruptcy case to an adversary proceeding. The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Central District of Utah. On April 20, 2021, the court lifted the stay as the final decision in the Disney Litigation had been determined and we were no longer in bankruptcy. VidAngel Entertainment assumed responsibility for defense of the ClearPlay litigation, and any settlement discussions thereto, as part of the asset purchase agreement, dated March 1, 2021, by and between ASI, Skip TV Holdings, LLC and VidAngel Entertainment, LLC (the VidAngel Asset Purchase Agreement ). On November 4, 2021, we informed the court that we sold VidAngel and VidAngel Entertainment is the successor. On January 14, 2022, ClearPlay filed a response stating ASI and VidAngel Entertainment is liable for past infringement as they are the successor to VidAngel. On December 20, 2021, we served non-infringement and invalidity contentions concerning the patents asserted in this case. On January 7, 2022, ClearPlay filed a motion seeking to add additional causes of action under the DMCA and Utah state law for alleged tortious interference, which we opposed on February 4, 2022. On June 23, 2022, the Court granted leave for ClearPlay to amend its complaint to add these claims but deferred to a later stage of the proceedings any ruling on the futility of the claims. On December 8, 2023, the Court held a Markman hearing to construe the scope and meaning of certain disputed claim terms in the asserted patents. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court took the matter under submission. On August 30, 2024 we entered into a settlement agreement with ClearPlay pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to pay ClearPlay a royalty of 1.8 million, which is to be paid in thirty-six monthly installments of 50.0 thousand per month. These payments will be made by VidAngel Entertainment, LLC, pursuant to the VidAngel Asset Purchase Agreement, in exchange for certain licensing rights, a covenant not to sue in the future and dismissal of the litigation with prejudice. The Chosen Arbitration Historically, our business generated a significant portion of our total revenue from distribution activities related to the Chosen Agreement. The Chosen Agreement outlines the current contractual arrangement between the parties pursuant to which we were granted a limited license to distribute, solely on the Angel App, all previous and future episodes and seasons of the series The Chosen, and any future audiovisual productions derivative thereof. Revenue from distribution activities related to the Chosen Agreement does not currently account for any percentage of our revenue. On April 4, 2023, The Chosen initiated a private binding arbitration against us alleging certain material breaches of contract under the Chosen Agreement, seeking to terminate the Chosen Agreement pursuant to which we were granted a limited license to distribute, solely on the Angel App, all previous and future episodes and seasons of the television series The Chosen, and any future audiovisual productions derivatives thereof. On May 28, 2024, the arbitrator in the arbitration proceedings issued an Interim Arbitration Award granting The Chosen s breach of contract claims and terminating the Chosen Agreement effective as of May 28, 2024. The Interim Arbitration Award granted The Chosen monetary damages in the amount of 30.0 thousand, plus costs and potential recovery of an allocable portion of its attorney fees. The Interim Arbitration Award denied in full The Chosen s claims for the remedies of disgorgement of profits and corrective advertising. On September 25, 2024, the Final Arbitration Award was issued, which remained consistent with the Interim Arbitration Award and granted a portion of The Chosen s costs and fees. We disagree with the arbitrator s decision regarding the breach of contract claims and the termination of the Chosen Agreement and intend to seek appellate review of the Final Arbitration Award in the arbitration proceedings, as permitted under the arbitration provision of the Chosen Agreement. Unless and until a favorable outcome of such appellate review is determined, we will fully comply with the Final Arbitration Award, including with respect to the termination of the Chosen Agreement effective as of May 28, 2024. Item 1A. Risk Factors Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include the risk factors described in our Form 10 filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024 and amended on April 19, 2024 and May 13, 2024. For risk factors related to the proposed Business Combination, see the Risk Factors section in the registration statement on Form S-4 that Southport

Table of Contents 
 has filed with the SEC relating to our proposed Business Combination. There have been no material changes in our risk factors since such filings, except for the following: Historically, a significant amount of our revenue has been derived from the Chosen Agreement. The termination of the Chosen Agreement could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our operating results. Historically, a significant amount of our revenue has been derived from distribution activities related to the Chosen Agreement. Revenues recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and derived from the Chosen Agreement were 40.0 million, 68.0 million, and 116.0 million, respectively. On April 4, 2023, The Chosen initiated a private binding arbitration against us alleging certain material breaches of contract under the Chosen Agreement, seeking to terminate the Chosen Agreement pursuant to which we were granted a limited license to distribute, solely on the Angel App, all previous and future episodes and seasons of the television series The Chosen, and any future audiovisual productions derivatives thereof. On May 28, 2024, the arbitrator in the arbitration proceedings issued an Interim Arbitration Award granting The Chosen s breach of contract claims and terminating the Chosen Agreement effective as of May 28, 2024. The Interim Arbitration Award granted The Chosen monetary damages in the amount of 30.0 thousand, plus costs and potential recovery of an allocable portion of its attorney fees. The Interim Arbitration Award denied in full The Chosen s claims for the remedies of disgorgement of profits and corrective advertising. On September 25, 2024, the final award was issued, which remained consistent with the Interim Arbitration Award and granted a portion of The Chosen s costs and fees. We disagree with the arbitrator s decision regarding the breach of contract claims and the termination of the Chosen Agreement and intend to seek appellate review of the Final Arbitration Award in the arbitration proceedings, as permitted under the arbitration provision of the Chosen Agreement. Unless and until a favorable outcome of such appellate review is determined, we will fully comply with the Final Arbitration Award, including with respect to the termination of the Chosen Agreement effective as of May 28, 2024. We are currently working with several new filmmakers on new projects. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to earn as much revenue from these new projects or from any upcoming projects as we did from the Chosen Agreement. If we are unable to continue to successfully monetize projects other than those arising under the Chosen Agreement, the termination of the Chosen Agreement could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our Bitcoin Holdings are and will be less liquid than cash and cash equivalents and may not be able to serve as a source of liquidity for us to the same extent as cash and cash equivalents. We intend to adopt bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset. Historically, the bitcoin markets have been characterized by significant volatility in price, limited liquidity and trading volumes compared to sovereign currencies markets, relative anonymity, a developing regulatory landscape, potential susceptibility to market abuse and manipulation, compliance and internal control failures at exchanges, and various other risks inherent in its entirely electronic, virtual form and decentralized network. During times of market instability, we may not be able to sell our bitcoin at favorable prices or at all. For example, a number of bitcoin trading venues temporarily halted deposits and withdrawals in 2022. As a result, our bitcoin holdings may not be able to serve as a source of liquidity for us to the same extent as cash and cash equivalents. Further, bitcoin we hold with our custodians and transact with our trade execution partners does not enjoy the same protections as are available to cash or securities deposited with or transacted by institutions subject to regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. Additionally, we may be unable to enter into term loans or other capital raising transactions collateralized by our unencumbered bitcoin or otherwise generate funds using our bitcoin holdings, including in particular during times of market instability or when the price of bitcoin has declined significantly. If we are unable to sell our bitcoin, enter into additional capital raising transactions using bitcoin as collateral, or otherwise generate funds using our bitcoin holdings, or if we are forced to sell our bitcoin at a significant loss, in order to meet our working capital requirements, our business and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and fluctuations in the price of bitcoin are likely to significantly influence our financial results and the market price of the Combined Company s Common Stock. Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and fluctuations in the price of bitcoin have in the past influenced and are likely to continue to influence our financial results and the market price of the Combined Company s Common Stock. Our financial results and the market price of the Combined Company s Common Stock would be adversely affected, and our business and financial condition would be negatively impacted, if the price of bitcoin decreased substantially (as it has in the past, including during 2022), including as a result of:

 decreased user and investor confidence in bitcoin, including due to the various factors described herein; investment and trading activities, such as (i) trading activities of highly active retail and institutional users, speculators, miners and investors, (ii) actual or expected significant dispositions of bitcoin by large holders, including the expected liquidation of digital assets associated with entities that have filed for bankruptcy protection and the transfer and sale of bitcoins associated with significant hacks, seizures, or forfeitures, such as the transfers of bitcoin to creditors of the hacked cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox which began in July 2024; and (iii) actual or perceived manipulation of the spot or derivative markets for bitcoin or spot bitcoin exchange-traded products; negative publicity, media or social media coverage, or sentiment due to events in or relating to, or perception of, bitcoin or the broader digital assets industry, for example, (i) public perception that bitcoin can be used as a vehicle to circumvent sanctions, including sanctions imposed on Russia or certain regions related to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, or to fund criminal or terrorist activities, such as the purported use of digital assets by Hamas to fund its terrorist attack against Israel in October 2023; (ii) expected or pending civil, criminal, regulatory enforcement or other high profile actions against major participants in the bitcoin ecosystem, including the SEC s enforcement actions against Coinbase, Inc. and Binance Holdings Ltd.; (iii) additional filings for bankruptcy protection or bankruptcy proceedings of major digital asset industry participants, such as the bankruptcy proceeding of FTX Trading and its affiliates; and (iv) the actual or perceived environmental impact of bitcoin and related activities, including environmental concerns raised by private individuals, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and other actors related to the energy resources consumed in the bitcoin mining process; changes in consumer preferences and the perceived value or prospects of bitcoin; competition from other digital assets that exhibit better speed, security, scalability, or energy efficiency, that feature other more favored characteristics, that are backed by governments, including the U.S. government, or reserves of fiat currencies, or that represent ownership or security interests in physical assets; a decrease in the price of other digital assets, including stablecoins, or the crash or unavailability of stablecoins that are used as a medium of exchange for bitcoin purchase and sale transactions, such as the crash of the stablecoin Terra USD in 2022, to the extent the decrease in the price of such other digital assets or the unavailability of such stablecoins may cause a decrease in the price of bitcoin or adversely affect investor confidence in digital assets generally; the identification of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or persons who developed bitcoin, or the transfer of substantial amounts of bitcoin from bitcoin wallets attributed to Mr. Nakamoto; disruptions, failures, unavailability, or interruptions in service of trading venues for bitcoin, such as, for example, the announcement by the digital asset exchange FTX Trading that it would freeze withdrawals and transfers from its accounts and subsequent filing for bankruptcy protection and the recent SEC enforcement action brought against Binance Holdings Ltd., which initially sought to freeze all of its assets during the pendency of the enforcement action; the filing for bankruptcy protection by, liquidation of, or market concerns about the financial viability of digital asset custodians, trading venues, lending platforms, investment funds, or other digital asset industry participants, such as the filing for bankruptcy protection by digital asset trading venues FTX Trading and BlockFi and digital asset lending platforms Celsius Network and Voyager Digital Holdings in 2022, the ordered liquidation of the digital asset investment fund Three Arrows Capital in 2022, the announced liquidation of Silvergate Bank in 2023, the government-mandated closure and sale of Signature Bank in 2023, the placement of Prime Trust, LLC into receivership following a cease-and-desist order issued by the Nevada Department of Business and Industry in 2023, and the exit of Binance from the U.S. market as part of its settlement with the Department of Justice and other federal regulatory agencies; regulatory, legislative, enforcement and judicial actions that adversely affect the price, ownership, transferability, trading volumes, legality or public perception of bitcoin, or that adversely affect the operations of or otherwise prevent digital asset custodians, trading venues, lending platforms or other digital assets industry participants from operating in a manner that allows them to continue to deliver services to the digital assets industry;

 further reductions in mining rewards of bitcoin, including block reward halving events, which are events that occur after a specific period of time that reduce the block reward earned by miners who validate bitcoin transactions, or increases in the costs associated with bitcoin mining, including increases in electricity costs and hardware and software used in mining, that may cause a decline in support for the bitcoin network; transaction congestion and fees associated with processing transactions on the bitcoin network; macroeconomic changes, such as changes in the level of interest rates and inflation, fiscal and monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions and fiat currency devaluations; developments in mathematics or technology, including in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum computing, that could result in the cryptography used by the bitcoin blockchain becoming insecure or ineffective; and changes in national and international economic and political conditions, including, without limitation, the adverse impact attributable to the economic and political instability caused by the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the economic sanctions adopted in response to the conflict, and the potential broadening of the Israel-Hamas conflict to other countries in the Middle East. 
 Bitcoin and other digital assets are novel assets, and are subject to significant legal, commercial, regulatory and technical uncertainty Bitcoin and other digital assets are relatively novel and are subject to significant uncertainty, which could adversely impact their price. The application of state and federal securities laws and other laws and regulations to digital assets is unclear in certain respects, and it is possible that regulators in the United States or foreign countries may interpret or apply existing laws and regulations in a manner that adversely affects the price of bitcoin. The U.S. federal government, states, regulatory agencies and foreign countries may also enact new laws and regulations, or pursue regulatory, legislative, enforcement or judicial actions, that could materially impact the price of bitcoin or the ability of individuals or institutions such as us to own or transfer bitcoin. For example: On March 9, 2022, President Biden signed an executive order relating to cryptocurrencies. While the executive order did not mandate the adoption of any specific regulations, it instructed various federal agencies to consider potential regulatory measures, including the evaluation of the creation of a U.S. central bank digital currency CBDC ). A number of reports issued pursuant to the executive order have focused on various risks related to the digital asset ecosystem, and have recommended additional legislation and regulatory oversight. On September 16, 2022, the White House released a framework for digital asset development, based on reports from various government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Department of Justice and the Department of Commerce. Among other things, the framework encourages regulators to pursue enforcement actions, issue guidance and rules to address current and emergent risks, support the development and use of innovative technologies by payment providers to increase access to instant payments, consider creating a federal framework to regulate nonbank payment providers, and evaluate whether to call upon Congress to amend the Bank Secrecy Act and laws against unlicensed money transmission to apply explicitly to digital asset service providers. There have also been several bills introduced in Congress that propose to establish additional regulation and oversight of the digital asset markets. On April 4, 2022, SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced that he has asked SEC staff to work (i) to register and regulate digital asset platforms like securities exchanges; (ii) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on how to jointly address digital asset platforms that trade both securities and non-securities; (iii) on segregating out digital asset platforms custody of customer assets, if appropriate; and (iv) on segregating out the market making functions of digital asset platforms, if appropriate. Similarly, foreign government authorities have recently expanded their efforts to restrict certain activities related to bitcoin and other digital assets. On September 8, 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy issued a report in coordination with other federal agencies relating to the climate and energy implications of digital assets, including bitcoin, in the United States. Among its finding are that digital assets are energy intensive and drive significant environmental impacts, and the report recommends further study of the environmental impact of digital assets and the development of environmental performance regulations for 

 33

 digital asset miners, which may include limiting or eliminating digital assets that use high energy intensity consensus mechanisms, including the proof-of-work consensus mechanisms on which the bitcoin blockchain is based. On March 1, 2023, the U.S. Under Secretary for Domestic Finance provided an update on the development of a U.S. CBDC, indicating that the U.S. Department of Treasury would be providing an initial set of findings and recommendations regarding the development and adoption of a U.S. CBDC in the coming months. On April 14, 2023, the SEC reopened the comment period for its proposal to amend the definition of exchange under Exchange Act Rule 3b-16 to encompass trading and communication protocol systems for digital asset securities and trading systems that use distributed ledger or blockchain technology, including both so-called centralized and decentralized trading systems. The comment period is now closed. The SEC may determine whether to adopt the revised definition after an evaluation of comments provided during the comment period. If adopted in its proposed form, the new definition would have a sweeping impact on digital asset trading venues and other digital asset industry participants. The European Union s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation MiCA ), a comprehensive digital asset regulatory framework for the issuance and use of digital assets, like bitcoin, became effective in June 2023, with various requirements phasing into effect through 2024. MiCA also requires the European Commission (i) to provide a report on the environmental impact of crypto-assets and (ii) based upon such report, introduce mandatory minimum sustainability standards for consensus mechanisms, including the proof-of-work consensus mechanisms on which the bitcoin blockchain is based. On June 5, 2023, the SEC filed a complaint against Binance Holdings Ltd. and other affiliated entities in federal district court for the District of Columbia, alleging, among other claims related to the operation of the affiliates and their platforms, that: (i) the Binance entities commingled and diverted customer assets; (ii) various affiliates of Binance Holdings Ltd. operated as exchanges, brokers, dealers and clearing agencies without registration under the Exchange Act; (iii) Binance Holdings Ltd. engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities; (iv) affiliates of Binance Holdings Ltd. operated in a manner to evade U.S. federal securities laws, and (v) affiliates of Binance Holdings Ltd. misled customers and investors concerning the existence and adequacy of market surveillance and controls to detect and prevent manipulative trading. On June 6, 2023, the SEC filed a complaint against Coinbase, Inc. and other affiliated entities in federal district court in the Southern District of New York, alleging, among other claims: (i) that Coinbase, Inc. violated the Exchange Act by failing to register with the SEC as a national securities exchange, broker-dealer and clearing agency, in connection with activities involving certain identified digital assets that the SEC s complaint alleges are securities, (ii) that Coinbase, Inc. violated the Securities Act by failing to register with the SEC the offer and sale of securities in connection with its staking program and (iii) that Coinbase Global Inc. is jointly and severally liable as a control person under the Exchange Act for Coinbase Inc. s violations of the Exchange Act to the same extent as Coinbase Inc. In the United Kingdom, on June 29, 2023, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 FSMA 2023 became law. FSMA 2023 (i) clarifies that cryptoassets are subject to the regulated activities and financial promotion orders and (ii) establishes that digital assets firms, including exchanges and custodians, operating in or providing services to the United Kingdom carrying out certain activities involving cryptoassets are performing a regulated activity that needs to be authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority and may also be subject to oversight from the Bank of England. Several additional pieces of proposed legislation in the United Kingdom, including The Public Offers and Admissions to Trading Regulations 2023, may subject cryptoassets to further regulation. FSMA 2023 gave the UK Treasury powers to create financial market infrastructure sandboxes. The legislative framework for the UK s Digital Securities Sandbox will take effect in January 2024. On November 20, 2023, the SEC filed a complaint against Payward Inc. and Payward Ventures Inc., together known as Kraken, alleging, among other claims, that Kraken s crypto trading platform was operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer and clearing agency. The SEC s complaint also alleges that Kraken s business practices, deficient internal controls and poor recordkeeping practices present a range of risks for its customers. On November 21, 2023, Binance Holdings Ltd. and its then chief executive officer reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, CFTC, the U.S. Department of Treasury s Office of Foreign Asset Control and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to resolve a multi-year investigation by the agencies and a civil suit brought by the CFTC, pursuant to which Binance agreed to, among other things, pay 4.3 billion in penalties across the four agencies and to discontinue its operations in the United States. Binance Holdings Ltd. also acknowledged that it willfully operated an unlicensed money

 transmitting business, pleaded guilty to criminal charges of not having adequate anti-money laundering protocols in place and committed violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and its then chief executive officer pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and resigned as chief executive officer of Binance. This settlement does not include any settlement of the SEC s complaint against Binance referenced above. In China, the People s Bank of China and the National Development and Reform Commission have outlawed cryptocurrency mining and declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal within the country. 
 It is not possible to predict whether, or when, any of these developments will lead to Congress granting additional authorities to the SEC or other regulators, or whether, or when, any other federal, state or foreign legislative bodies will take any similar actions. It is also not possible to predict the nature of any such additional authorities, how additional legislation or regulatory oversight might impact the ability of digital asset markets to function or the willingness of financial and other institutions to continue to provide services to the digital assets industry, nor how any new regulations or changes to existing regulations might impact the value of digital assets generally and bitcoin specifically. The consequences of increased regulation of digital assets and digital asset activities could adversely affect the market price of bitcoin and in turn adversely affect the market price of the Combined Company s Common Stock. Moreover, the risks of engaging in a bitcoin treasury strategy are relatively novel and have created, and could continue to create, complications due to the lack of experience that third parties have with companies engaging in such a strategy, such as increased costs of director and officer liability insurance or the potential inability to obtain such coverage on acceptable terms in the future. The growth of the digital assets industry in general, and the use and acceptance of bitcoin in particular, may also impact the price of bitcoin and is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The pace of worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoin may depend, for instance, on public familiarity with digital assets, ease of buying, accessing or gaining exposure to bitcoin, institutional demand for bitcoin as an investment asset, the participation of traditional financial institutions in the digital assets industry, consumer demand for bitcoin as a means of payment, and the availability and popularity of alternatives to bitcoin. Even if growth in bitcoin adoption occurs in the near or medium-term, there is no assurance that bitcoin usage will continue to grow over the long-term. Because bitcoin has no physical existence beyond the record of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, a variety of technical factors related to the bitcoin blockchain could also impact the price of bitcoin. For example, malicious attacks by miners, inadequate mining fees to incentivize validating of bitcoin transactions, hard forks of the bitcoin blockchain into multiple blockchains and advances in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum computing could undercut the integrity of the bitcoin blockchain and negatively affect the price of bitcoin. The liquidity of bitcoin may also be reduced and damage to the public perception of bitcoin may occur, if financial institutions were to deny or limit banking services to businesses that hold bitcoin, provide bitcoin related services or accept bitcoin as payment, which could also decrease the price of bitcoin. Recent actions by U.S. banking regulators have reduced the ability of bitcoin-related services providers to access to banking services, including (i) the issuance of the February 23, 2023 Interagency Liquidity Risk Statement by the Federal banking agencies cautioning banks on contagion risks posed by providing services to digital assets customers, (ii) the Federal Reserve Board s denial of Custodia Bank s application of a Federal Reserve account, and (iii) the inclusion of crypto-related divestiture conditions in recent merger transaction approvals. Additionally, in August 2023, the Federal Reserve established a Novel Activities Supervision Program to enhance the supervision of novel activities conducted by banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve. The program will focus on novel activities related to crypto-assets, distributed ledger technology and complex, technology-driven partnerships with nonbanks to deliver financial services to customers. Liquidity of bitcoin may also be impacted to the extent that changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements negatively impact the ability of exchanges and trading venues to provide services for bitcoin and other digital assets. Our historical financial statements do not reflect the potential variability in earnings that we may experience in the future relating to our bitcoin holdings. Our historical financial statements do not fully reflect the potential variability in earnings that we may experience in the future from holding or selling significant amounts of bitcoin. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, which upon our adoption will require us to measure our bitcoin holdings at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and to recognize gains and losses from changes in the fair value of our bitcoin in net income each reporting period. ASU 2023-08 will also require us to provide certain interim and annual disclosures with respect to our bitcoin holdings. The standard is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which we adopt the guidance. Early 

 35 

Table of Contents 
 adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period for which our consolidated financial statements have not been issued as of the beginning of the annual reporting period. Due in particular to the volatility in the price of bitcoin, we expect the adoption of ASU 2023-08 to increase the volatility of our financial results and significantly affect the carrying value of our bitcoin on our balance sheet. Additionally, as a result of ASU 2023-08 requiring a cumulative-effect adjustment to our opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual period in which we adopt the guidance and not permitting retrospective restatement of prior period, our future results will not be comparable to results from periods prior to our adoption of the guidance. Because we intend to purchase a significant amount of additional bitcoin in future periods and significantly increase our overall holdings of bitcoin, we expect that the proportion of our total assets represented by our bitcoin holdings will substantially increase in the future. As a result, and in particular with respect to the quarterly periods and full fiscal year with respect to which ASU 2023-08 will apply, and for all future periods, volatility in our earnings may be significantly more than what we experienced in prior periods. Bitcoin does not pay interest or dividends. Bitcoin does not pay interest or other returns and we can only generate cash from our bitcoin holdings if we sell our bitcoin or implement strategies to create income streams or otherwise generate cash by using our bitcoin holdings. Even if we pursue any such strategies, we may be unable to create income streams or otherwise generate cash from our bitcoin holdings, and any such strategies may subject us to additional risks. We expect our bitcoin holdings will significantly impact our financial results and the market price of the Combined Company s Common Stock. We expect our bitcoin holdings will significantly affect our financial results and if we significantly increase our overall holdings of bitcoin in the future as we are expected to do, they will have an even greater impact on our financial results and the market price of the Combined Company s Common Stock. Our bitcoin treasury strategy has not been tested over any period of time or under different market conditions. The bitcoin financing strategy that we continue to implement has not been tested over any period of time or under different market conditions. For example, although we believe bitcoin, due to its limited supply, has the potential to serve as a hedge against inflation in the long term, the short-term price of bitcoin declined in recent periods during which the inflation rate increased. Some investors and other market participants may disagree with our bitcoin treasury strategy or actions we undertake to implement it. If bitcoin prices were to decrease or our bitcoin treasury strategy otherwise proves unsuccessful, our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of the Combined Company s Common Stock would be materially adversely impacted. Changes in our ownership of bitcoin could have accounting, regulatory and other impacts. While we currently own a modest amount of bitcoin, we expect to acquire a significant amount of bitcoin following the completion of the Business Combination and expect to investigate many potential approaches to owning bitcoin, including indirect ownership (for example, through ownership interests in a fund that owns bitcoin). If we were to own all or a portion of our bitcoin in a different manner, the accounting treatment for our bitcoin, our ability to use our bitcoin as collateral for additional borrowings and the regulatory requirements to which we are subject, may correspondingly change. The broader digital assets industry is subject to counterparty risks, which could adversely impact the adoption rate, price and use of bitcoin. A series of recent high-profile bankruptcies, closures, liquidations, regulatory enforcement actions and other events relating to companies operating in the digital asset industry, including the filings for bankruptcy protection by Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, FTX Trading and Genesis Global Capital, the closure or liquidation of certain financial institutions that provided lending and other services to the digital assets industry, including Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, SEC enforcement actions against Coinbase, Inc. and Binance Holdings Ltd., the placement of Prime Trust, LLC into receivership following a cease-and-desist order issued by Nevada s Department of Business and Industry, and the filing and subsequent settlement of a civil fraud lawsuit by the New York Attorney General against Genesis Global Capital, its parent company Digital Currency Group, Inc., and former partner Gemini Trust Company, have highlighted the counterparty risks applicable to owning and transacting in digital assets. Although these bankruptcies, closures, liquidations and other events have not resulted in any loss or misappropriation of our bitcoin, nor have such 

 36 

Table of Contents 
 events adversely impacted our access to our bitcoin, they have, in the short-term, likely negatively impacted the adoption rate and use of bitcoin. Additional bankruptcies, closures, liquidations, regulatory enforcement actions or other events involving participants in the digital assets industry in the future may further negatively impact the adoption rate, price and use of bitcoin, limit the availability to us of financing collateralized by bitcoin, or create or expose additional counterparty risks. If we or our third-party service providers experience a security breach or cyberattack and unauthorized parties obtain access to our bitcoin, or if our private keys are lost or destroyed, or other similar circumstances or events occur, we may lose some or all of our bitcoin and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Bitcoin and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and the entities that provide services to participants in the bitcoin ecosystem have been, and may in the future be, subject to security breaches, cyberattacks or other malicious activities. For example, in October 2021 it was reported that hackers exploited a flaw in the account recovery process and stole from the accounts of at least 6,000 customers of the Coinbase exchange, although the flaw was subsequently fixed and Coinbase reimbursed affected customers. Similarly, in November 2022, hackers exploited weaknesses in the security architecture of the FTX Trading digital asset exchange and reportedly stole over 400.0 million in digital assets from customers. A successful security breach or cyberattack could result in: a partial or total loss of our bitcoin in a manner that may not be covered by insurance or the liability provisions of the custody agreements with the custodians who hold our bitcoin; harm to our reputation and brand; improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable data privacy and other laws; or significant regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, penalties, and other legal, regulatory, contractual and financial exposure. 
 Further, any actual or perceived data security breach or cybersecurity attack directed at other companies with digital assets or companies that operate digital asset networks, regardless of whether we are directly impacted, could lead to a general loss of confidence in the broader bitcoin blockchain ecosystem or in the use of the bitcoin network to conduct financial transactions, which could negatively impact us. Attacks upon systems across a variety of industries, including industries related to bitcoin, are increasing in frequency, persistence and sophistication, and, in many cases, are being conducted by sophisticated, well-funded and organized groups and individuals, including state actors. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to systems and information (including personal data and digital assets), disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. These attacks may occur on our systems or those of our third-party service providers or partners. We may experience breaches of our security measures due to human error, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities. In particular, unauthorized parties have attempted, and we expect that they will continue to attempt, to gain access to our systems and facilities, as well as those of our partners and third-party service providers, through various means, such as hacking, social engineering, phishing and fraud. In the past, hackers have successfully employed a social engineering attack against one of our service providers and misappropriated our digital assets, although, to date, such events have not been material to our financial condition or operating results. Threats can come from a variety of sources, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and insiders. In addition, certain types of attacks could harm us even if our systems are left undisturbed. For example, certain threats are designed to remain dormant or undetectable, sometimes for extended periods of time, or until launched against a target and we may not be able to implement adequate preventative measures. Further, there has been an increase in such activities due to the increase in work-from-home arrangements since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk of cyberattacks could also be increased by cyberwarfare in connection with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts, or other future conflicts, including potential proliferation of malware into systemsunrelated to such conflicts. Any future breach of our operations or those of others in the bitcoin industry, including third-party services on which we rely, could materially and adversely affect our business.

 Regulatory change reclassifying bitcoin as a security could lead to our classification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act and could adversely affect the market price of bitcoin and the market price of the Combined Company s Common Stock. While senior SEC officials have stated their view that bitcoin is not a security for purposes of the federal securities laws, a contrary determination by the SEC could lead to our classification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, which would subject us to significant additional regulatory controls that could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations and may also require us to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our business. In addition, if bitcoin is determined to constitute a security for purposes of the federal securities laws, the additional regulatory restrictions imposed by such a determination could adversely affect the market price of bitcoin and in turn adversely affect the market price of the Combined Company s Common Stock.
