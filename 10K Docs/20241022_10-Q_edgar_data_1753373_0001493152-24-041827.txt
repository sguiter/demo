Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial
statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contain forward looking statements that
involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking
statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to, those which are not within our control. 

Overview 

The
Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 12, 2018. On June 7, 2023, the Company M2i Global, Inc. (formerly
known as Inky Inc. filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada an Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to change
its corporate name from Inky, Inc. , to M2i Global, Inc. , effective June 7, 2023. 

The
Company was formerly engaged in developing mobile software applications for smartphones and table devices. During May 2023, the Company
became the sole shareholder of U.S. Minerals and Metals Corp., a Nevada corporation USMM through the issuance of preferred
and common shares for cash. Concurrently, the Company shifted its operations to specialization in the development and execution of a
complete global value supply chain for critical minerals for the U.S. government and U.S. free trade partners. The Company s vision
is to develop and execute a complete global value supply chain for critical minerals for the United States government and certain trading
partners of the United States. To implement this vision, the Company intends to operate three key business divisions as set forth below: 

M2i
 Mining, Processing Refining: a business engaged in sourcing, extraction, processing, refining, transporting and selling primary
 minerals and metals; 

M2i
 Scrap Recycling: a business engaged in the collection, processing, transporting and selling of scrap, recycled and reused metals;
 and 

M2i
 Government and Defense Industrial Base: a business engaged in aligning with U.S. policy to facilitate participation in U.S. government
 programs such as the creation and management of a Strategic Minerals Reserve as an enhancement of the U.S. government s National
 Defense Stockpile. 

On
June 30, 2024, the Company and Komodo Capital Komodo ), a company specializing in the development and execution of a complete
global value supply chain for critical minerals for the U.S. government and U.S. free trade partners, entered into a strategic partnership
(the Strategic Partnership ), in order for Komodo to use its relationships to provide the Company with access to various
critical minerals, with an ultimate goal of suppling the U.S. government and U.S. free trade partners with these critical minerals. Komodo
Capital also offers comprehensive advisory services. The Company issued 8,000,000 shares of common stock as part of this agreement. 

On
June 30, 2024, the Company and NTM Minerals Limited NTM ), a company specializing in the development and execution of a
complete global value supply chain for critical minerals for the U.S. government and U.S. free trade partners, entered into an exclusive
offtake agreement (the Offtake Agreement ), in which NTM will provide for 88,000 tonnes of copper, currently valued at approximately
 850 million. The Company is granted offtake rights for a maximum of 88,000 tonnes of copper that is sourced from the Redbank tenements
in return for 12 million shares of the Company s common stock. NTM shall receive additional payments for incremental resource increases
or upgrades from the Redbank tenements. M2i retains the option to participate in production pre-funding opportunities.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

During
the period ended August 31, 2024, and through the filing of this report, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ). Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by
the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact
on the Company s financial statements. 

All
other new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective or adopted have been deemed not to be relevant to us, hence are not
expected to have any impact once adopted. 

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies 

There
have been no changes to the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on April 16, 2024. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
August 31, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of 28,213, as compared to a cash balance of 48,197 at November 30, 2023. The Company
incurred negative cash flow from operations of 1,400,469 for the period ended August 31, 2024, as compared to negative cash flow from
operations of 954,702 in the comparable prior year period. The increase in negative cash flows from operations was primarily from an
increase in net loss. Cash flows from financing activities during the period ended August 31, 2024, totalled 1,380,485, as compared to
cash flows from financing activities in the comparable prior year period of 999,501. The increase in cash provided by financing activities
is primarily the result of 1,775,985 in proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock. Going forward, the Company expects capital
expenditures to increase significantly as operations are expanded pursuant to its current growth plans. The Company anticipates the requirement
to raise significant debt or equity capital in order to fund future operations. 

Results
of Operations 

Comparison
of the Three and Nine Months Ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023 

For
the comparable three months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the Company s revenues totalled 0. For the nine months ended
August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, the Company s revenues totalled 0 and 3,400, respectively. We anticipate the Company s
revenues in upcoming quarters may increase significantly as management attempts to implement the Company s new business model. 

For
the three months ended August 31, 2024, our operating expenses decreased to 716,546 compared to 1,446,398 for the comparable period
in 2023. The decrease of 729,852 was primarily reductions in travel and professional fees. For the nine months ended August 31, 2024,
our operating expenses increased to 2,740,543 compared to 2,016,929 for the comparable period in 2023. The increase of 723,614 was
primarily driven by travel and professional fees for consultants to implement the shift in strategic focus and preparations for increased
operations. We anticipate future operating expenses to increase with the expansion of operations, resulting in increased expenses related
to compensation and professional fees.

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Cybersecurity 

Risk
Management and Strategy 

We
recognize the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information
systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. 

Managing
Material Risks Integrated Overall Risk Management 

We
have strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader risk management framework to promote a company-wide culture
of cybersecurity risk management. This integration ensures that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our decision-making
processes at every level. Our management team continuously evaluates and addresses cybersecurity risks in alignment with our business
objectives and operational needs. 

Oversee
Third-party Risk 

Because
we are aware of the risks associated with third-party service providers, we have implemented stringent processes to oversee and manage
these risks. We conduct thorough security assessments of all third-party providers before engagement and maintain ongoing monitoring
to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards. The monitoring includes annual assessments of the SOC reports of our providers
and implementing complementary controls. This approach is designed to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents
originating from third parties. 

Risks
from Cybersecurity Threats 

We
have not encountered cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired our operations or financial standing. 

Item
3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

We
are a smaller reporting company and, therefore, we are not required to provide information required by this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: Our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness and design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer has concluded that, at August 31, 2024, such disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to management including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls: Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Our Chief Executive Officer
has concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not sufficiently effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system were
met.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended August 31, 2024, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

In
our annual report for the year ended November 30, 2023, we identified the following material weakness which is still applicable: 

We
 did not implement appropriate information technology controls 

In
our annual report for the year ended November 30, 2023, we identified the following material weaknesses which are no longer applicable: 

We
 did not maintain appropriate cash controls the handling of cash and accounting functions have been segregated and bills require
 management approval prior to payment. 

The
 Company lacks segregation of duties beginning in May 2023, the Company began to improve internal controls by hiring additional
 resources to ensure appropriate review and oversight. 

We
 do not have an audit committee. During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, the Company
 implemented an audit committee.
