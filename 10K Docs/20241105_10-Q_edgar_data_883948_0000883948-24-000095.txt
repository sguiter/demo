 shares of the Company s common stock, resulting in million additional shares issued, or aggregate consideration of million, based on the closing price per share of the Company s common stock as quoted on NYSE on March 28, 2024, which was the last trading day prior to the consummation of the acquisition. With the acquisition of American National, the Company acquired branches, deepening its presence in central and western Virginia, and expanding its franchise into contiguous markets in southern Virginia and in North Carolina. As a result of the American National acquisition, the Company s associated goodwill at September 30, 2024 totaled million, which reflects expected synergies and economies of scale from the American National merger, allocated between the Company s Wholesale Banking million) and Consumer Banking million) reporting segments, which is not deductible for tax purposes. While the Company believed the information available on April 1, 2024 provided a reasonable basis for estimating fair value, the Company obtained additional information and evidence within the one year measurement period, that resulted in changes to the estimated fair value amounts and associated goodwill for which measurement period adjustments were recorded. Measurement period adjustments recorded during the third quarter of 2024 related to the Company s foreclosed properties, deferred tax assets, and long-term borrowings, which resulted in a million increase in the preliminary goodwill recognized as part of the American National acquisition during the second quarter of 2024. Valuations subject to change include, but are not limited to: LHFI, identified intangible assets, certain deposits, income taxes, and certain other assets and liabilities. In addition, certain reclassification adjustments were made to other assets and other liabilities to conform to the Company s current balance sheet presentation. Fair value of assets acquired: Cash and cash equivalents Securities AFS LHFS LHFI Premises and equipment CDI and other intangibles Bank owned life insurance Other assets Total assets Fair value of liabilities assumed: Deposits Short-term borrowings Long-term borrowings Other liabilities Total liabilities Fair value of net assets acquired Preliminary goodwill

Table of Contents 
 Cash and cash equivalents: The fair value was determined to approximate the carrying amount based on the short-term nature of these assets. Securities AFS : The fair value of the investment portfolio was based on quoted market prices and dealer quotes and pricing obtained from independent pricing services. LHFS : The LHFS portfolio was recorded at fair value based on quotes or bids from third parties. LHFI : Fair values for LHFI were estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis that considered factors including loan type, interest rate type, prepayment speeds, duration, and current discount rates. The discount rates used for loans were based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and factored in adjustments for any expected liquidity events. Expected cash flows were derived using inputs that considered estimated credit losses and prepayments. Premises and equipment : The fair value of bank premises and equipment held for use was valued by obtaining recent market data for similar property types with adjustments for characteristics of individual properties. CDI and other intangibles : CDI represents the future economic benefit of acquired customer deposits. The fair value of the CDI asset was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that incorporated expected customer attrition rates, cost of deposit base, net maintenance cost associated with customer deposits, and the cost for alternative funding sources. The discount rates used were based on market rates. Other intangibles include customer relationship intangible assets and non-compete intangible assets. Customer relationship intangible assets represent the value associated with customer relationships related to the wealth management business that was acquired. Non-compete intangible assets represent the value associated with non-compete agreements for former employees in place at the date of the acquisition. BOLI: The fair value of BOLI is carried at its current cash surrender value, which is the most reasonable estimate of fair value. Deposits : The fair value of interest bearing and non-interest bearing deposits is the amount payable on demand at the acquisition date. The fair value of time deposits was estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that includes a market rate analysis of the current rates offered by market participants for certificates of deposits that mature in the same period. Short-Term Borrowings : Acquired short term borrowings consist of FHLB overnight borrowings and borrowings under repurchase agreements. The fair value of the short-term borrowings was determined to approximate the carrying amounts. Long-Term Borrowings : The fair values of the Company s long-term borrowings, including trust preferred securities, were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

For classes of loans within the Commercial segment, the primary credit quality indicator used for evaluating credit quality and estimating the ALLL is risk rating categories of Pass, Watch, Special Mention, Substandard, and Doubtful. For classes of loans within the Consumer segment, the primary credit quality indicator used for evaluating credit quality and estimating ALLL is delinquency bands of current, 30-59, 60-89, 90+, and nonaccrual. While other credit quality indicators are evaluated and analyzed as part of the Company s credit risk management activities, these indicators are primarily used in estimating the ALLL. The Company evaluates the credit risk of its loan portfolio on at least a quarterly basis. The Company presents loan and lease portfolio segments and classes by credit quality indicator and vintage year. The Company defines the vintage date for the purpose of this disclosure as the date of the most recent credit decision. Renewals are categorized as new credit decisions and reflect the renewal date as the vintage date, except for renewals of loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty or TLMs, which are presented in the original vintage.

Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Because many of the commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of customers to third parties.

 (1) Other bonds include asset-backed securities. (2) Includes hedged and non-hedged derivatives. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets after they are evaluated for impairment. The primary assets accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are related to LHFS, foreclosed properties, former bank premises, and collateral-dependent loans that are individually assessed. When the asset is secured by real estate, the Company measures the fair value utilizing an income or market valuation approach based on an appraisal conducted by an independent, licensed appraiser using observable market data. Management may discount the value from the appraisal in determining the fair value if, based on its understanding of the market conditions, the collateral had been impaired below the appraised value (Level 3). The nonrecurring valuation adjustments for these assets did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments for interim periods and excludes certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company. Refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure fair value. Cash and Cash Equivalents: T he carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. HTM Securities: The Company s investment portfolio is primarily valued using fair value measurements that are considered to be Level 2; however, there are a few investments that are considered to be Level 3. The Company has contracted with a third-party portfolio accounting service vendor for valuation of its securities portfolio; no material differences were identified during the valuations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 AFS securities HTM securities Restricted stock LHFS LHFI, net of deferred fees and costs Financial Derivatives (1) Accrued interest receivable BOLI LIABILITIES Deposits Borrowings Accrued interest payable Financial Derivatives (1) 

 (1) Includes hedged and non-hedged derivatives. The Company assumes interest rate risk (the risk that general interest rate levels will change) as a result of its normal operations. As a result, the fair values of the Company s financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Company. Management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk. Borrowers with fixed rate obligations, however, are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment. Conversely, depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment. Management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans and deposits and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate the Company s overall interest rate risk.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), and changes in stockholders equity for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated interim financial statements ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 22, 2024, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ Ernst Young LLP Richmond, Virginia November 5, 2024

 ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis provides information about the major components of our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the other financial data included in this report, as well as our 2023 Form 10-K, including the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section therein. Our results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the full year or for any other period. Amounts are rounded for presentation purposes; however, some of the percentages presented are computed based on unrounded amounts. In the following discussion and analysis, we provide certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are a supplement to GAAP, which we used to prepare our financial statements, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. We use the non-GAAP financial measures discussed herein in our analysis of our performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional understanding of our ongoing operations, enhance comparability of our results of operations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods presented without the impact of items or events that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. Non-GAAP financial measures may be identified with the symbol (+) and may be labeled as adjusted. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section within this Item 2 for more information about these non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

We do not intend or assume any obligation to update, revise or clarify any forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our consolidated financial statements based on the application of accounting and reporting policies in accordance with GAAP and general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies, which require the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments, which may prove inaccurate or are subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, estimates, assumptions or judgements could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and/or results of operations. Certain accounting policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. As a result of the American National merger, which closed on April 1, 2024, we have updated our critical accounting estimates to include acquisition accounting. Accordingly, we have identified the allowance for loan and lease losses, fair value measurements, and acquisition accounting as accounting policies that require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new or additional information becomes available or circumstances change. Therefore, we evaluate these accounting policies and related critical accounting estimates on an ongoing basis and update them as needed. Management has discussed these accounting policies and critical accounting estimates summarized below with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We provide additional information about our critical accounting estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 Form 10-K, other than with respect to acquisition accounting, which we discuss below. Other than as noted above and discussed below, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies or the estimates made pursuant to those policies during the most recent quarter from those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. Our significant accounting policies, other than acquisition accounting, are discussed in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our 2023 Form 10-K. Our significant accounting policies regarding acquisition accounting are discussed in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Acquisition Accounting We account for mergers and acquisitions that qualify as a business combination under ASC 805, Business Combinations , which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, we record all identifiable assets acquired, including intangible assets and the liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Determining fair 

 - 56 - 

Table of Contents 
 values of net assets acquired often involves estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation techniques. These methodologies are inherently subjective and involve significant assumptions, adjustments, and judgement around the selection of assumptions including, among others, discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions, and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change. The determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is also subjective. While the selected fair values represented our best estimate of fair value as of the acquisition date, these estimates are inherently uncertain. In addition, the acquisition method of accounting allows for a measurement period to adjust acquisition accounting for up to one year after the acquisition date, for new information that existed at the acquisition date but may not have been known or available at that time. For further information, refer to Note 2 Acquisitions in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. The fair value for acquired loans is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis that considers factors including loan type, interest rate type, prepayment speeds, duration, and current discount rates. These cash flow evaluations are inherently subjective as they require material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The fair value adjustment is recorded as a premium or discount to the unpaid principal balance of each acquired loan. PCD loans are loans that have experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination and are recorded at the amount paid. An ALLL on PCD loans is determined using the same methodology as other LHFI, however, there is no initial impact to net income to record the allowance at acquisition. The sum of the PCD loan s purchase price and ALLL becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the PCD loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan under ASC 310-20, Receivables Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs . If the PCD loan has revolving privileges, the discount/premium is amortized/accreted using the straight-line method; otherwise, the effective interest method is used. Subsequent changes to the ALLL on PCD loans are recorded through provision expense. The allowance for credit losses for non-PCD loans is recognized as provision expense upon acquisition using the Company s existing ACL methodology. See Note 2 Acquisitions in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for additional discussion of American National acquisition. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (ISSUED BUT NOT FULLY ADOPTED) In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023- 07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which requires enhanced segment reporting disclosures.

The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 14, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. ASU No. 2023-07 is not expected to have an impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations but could change certain disclosures in the Company s future SEC filings starting with its 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . This guidance requires enhanced disclosure for the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures and aligns the guidance to SEC Regulation S-X disclosure requirements. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. ASU No. 2023-09 is not expected to have an impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations but could change certain disclosures in the Company s SEC filings.

 RECENT EVENTS Proposed Merger with Sandy Spring On October 21, 2024, the Company entered into a merger agreement with Sandy Spring, a Maryland corporation. The merger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Sandy Spring will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the Surviving Entity. Immediately following the merger, the Company will cause Sandy Spring s wholly owned banking subsidiary, Sandy Spring Bank, a Federal Reserve member bank chartered under the laws of the State of Maryland, to merge with and into the Bank, with the Bank continuing as the surviving bank. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Sandy Spring Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares of restricted Sandy Spring Common Stock and certain shares held by the Company or Sandy Spring, will be converted into the right to receive 0.900 shares of common stock, par value 1.33 per share, of the Company and cash in lieu of fractional shares. The merger agreement was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each of the Company and Sandy Spring, and is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of the Company and Sandy Spring. The proposed transaction is expected to close by the third quarter of 2025. Forward Sale Agreement On October 21, 2024, the Company also announced that in connection with the execution of the merger agreement, it entered into a forward sale agreement (the Base Forward Sale Agreement with Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, the Forward Purchaser relating to an aggregate of 9,859,155 shares of the Company s common stock. On October 21, 2024, the Company priced the public offering of shares of the Company s common stock in connection with the Base Forward Sale Agreement and entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement with Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, as representative for the underwriters named therein, the Forward Purchaser and Morgan Stanley Co. LLC as forward seller (the Forward Seller ), relating to the registered public offering and sale of 9,859,155 shares of the Company s common stock at a public offering price of 35.50 per share (before underwriting discounts and commissions). The underwriters were granted a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,478,873 shares of the Company s common stock. On October 21, 2024, the underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase the additional 1,478,873 shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and, in connection therewith, the Company entered into an additional forward sale agreement (the Additional Forward Sale Agreement, and together with the Base Forward Sale Agreement, the Forward Sale Agreement with the Forward Purchaser relating to 1,478,873 shares of the Company s common stock, on terms substantially similar to those contained in the Base Forward Sale Agreement. The Company did not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of the Company s common stock sold by the Forward Seller to the underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement. The Company expects to physically settle the Forward Sale Agreement (by the delivery of shares of the Company s common stock) and receive proceeds from the sale of those shares of the Company s common stock upon one or more forward settlement dates within approximately 18 months from the date of the Forward Sale Agreement at the then applicable forward sale price. The forward sale price was initially 34.08 per share, which is equal to the public offering price per share, less the underwriting discount per share, and would result in net proceeds (before offering expenses) of approximately 386.4 million to the Company under the Forward Sale Agreement. No physical settlement has occurred through the date on which these consolidated financial statements were issued.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Merger with American National Bankshares Inc. On April 1, 2024, we completed our acquisition of American National, the holding company for American National Bank and Trust Company. American National s results of operations are included in our consolidated results since the date of acquisition, and therefore, our third quarter and first nine months of 2024 results reflect increased levels of average balances, net interest income, and expense compared to our results for the corresponding period in 2023. For more information, reference Note 2 Acquisitions in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Industry Events and Economic Environment We are continually monitoring the impact of various global and national events on our results of operations and financial condition, including inflation, changes in market interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, and the upcoming elections. The timing and impact of inflation, changes in market interest rates, and the competitive landscape of deposits on our business and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, on September 18, 2024, the FOMC announced that it was lowering the Federal Funds target rate by 50 bps to its current range of 4.75 to 5.0 . While inflation has eased in 2024, it remains elevated over the FOMC s long-run target of 2.0 . The FOMC noted that it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2.0 . Further the FOMC has also noted that it will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the Federal Funds rate and that its assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. The FOMC noted that it would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the FOMC s goals. The FOMC also confirmed the continued reduction to the Federal Reserve s holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS. We will continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to seek to manage our risk related to interest rate fluctuations and monitor balance sheet trends, deposit flows, and liquidity needs to ensure that we are able to meet the needs of our customers and maintain financial flexibility. Refer to Liquidity within this Item 2 for additional information about our liquidity and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report for additional information about the Company s interest rate sensitivity. Financial institutions continue to deal with macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds. The higher-for-longer interest rate environment and heightened competition for deposits has led to a continued shift within deposit composition toward higher cost products, although the pace of movement has slowed in recent months. The interest rate environment has also affected the affordability of credit to consumers and businesses, moderating loan demand. At September 30, 2024, our LHFI and total deposits increased from December 31, 2023 by 2.7 billion and 3.5 billion, respectively, and our short-term borrowings decreased by 486.6 million from December 31, 2023, which includes the impact of our acquisition of American National. At September 30, 2024, noninterest bearing deposits comprised 22 of total deposits, compared to 24 at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that approximately 72.7 of our deposits were insured or collateralized, and that we maintained available liquidity sources to cover approximately 166.1 of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits. In addition, to further bolster our funding position, we augmented customer deposit growth by also increasing brokered deposits to 1.4 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 869.9 million from December 31, 2023. Our regulatory capital ratios continued to exceed the standards to be considered well-capitalized under regulatory requirements. See Capital Resources within this Item 2 for additional information about our regulatory capital.

Balance Sheet Our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 includes the impact of the American National acquisition, which closed on April 1, 2024 and resulted in goodwill of 287.5 million. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the allocation of the purchase price for certain provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date was adjusted to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. This resulted in a 5.2 million increase in the preliminary goodwill of 282.3 million recognized during the second quarter of 2024. Total assets were 24.8 billion at September 30, 2024 and included 18.3 billion of LHFI. Total investments were 3.5 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 349.0 million from December 31, 2023 primarily due to the acquisition of American National. AFS securities totaled 2.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2.2 billion at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, total net unrealized losses on the AFS securities portfolio were 334.5 million, a decrease of 49.8 million from 384.3 million at December 31, 2023. HTM securities are carried at cost and totaled 807.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 837.4 million at December 31, 2023 and had net unrealized losses of 30.3 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.0 million from 29.3 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, total deposits were 20.3 billion, an increase of 3.5 billion from December 31, 2023, due to a 2.2 billion increase in interest-bearing customer deposits and a 459.7 million increase in demand deposits, primarily due to the American National acquisition. In addition, brokered deposits increased 869.9 million from December 31, 2023 to 1.4 billion at September 30, 2024.

 NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income, which represents our principal source of revenue, is the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense. Our interest margin represents net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. Changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as their respective yields and rates, have a significant impact on our net interest income, the net interest margin, and net income. In addition, our interest income includes the accretion of discounts on our acquired loans, which will also affect our net interest income and net interest margin. We seek to fund increased loan volumes by growing our core deposits, but, subject to internal policy limits on the amount of wholesale funding we may maintain, we may use wholesale funding sources to fund shortfalls, if any, or provide additional liquidity. To the extent that our dependence on wholesale funding sources increases, as was the case during 2024 and 2023, our net interest margin would likely be negatively impacted. The following tables show interest income on earning assets and related average yields, as well as interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and related average rates paid for the three and nine months ended September 30, (dollars in thousands): 

For the Three Months Ended 2024 2023 Change Average interest-earning assets 21,983,946 18,462,505 3,521,441 Interest and dividend income 324,528 247,159 77,369 Interest and dividend income (FTE) (+) 328,427 250,903 77,524 Yield on interest-earning assets 5.87 5.31 56 bps Yield on interest-earning assets (FTE) (+) 5.94 5.39 55 bps Average interest-bearing liabilities 16,592,103 13,481,946 3,110,157 Interest expense 141,596 95,218 46,378 Cost of interest-bearing liabilities 3.40 2.80 60 bps Cost of funds 2.56 2.04 52 bps Net interest income 182,932 151,941 30,991 Net interest income (FTE) (+) 186,831 155,685 31,146 Net interest margin 3.31 3.27 4 bps Net interest margin (FTE) (+) 3.38 3.35 3 bps For the third quarter of 2024, our net interest income was 182.9 million, an increase of 30.9 million from the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income (FTE) (+) for the third quarter of 2024 was 186.8 million, an increase of 31.1 million from the third quarter of 2023. The increases in both net interest income and net interest income (FTE) (+) were primarily the result of a 3.5 billion increase in average interest earning assets, and higher net accretion income, partially offset by a 3.1 billion increase in average interest bearing liabilities, in each case primarily related to the acquisition of American National. In the third quarter of 2024, our net interest margin increased 4 bps to 3.31 from 3.27 in the third quarter of 2023, and our net interest margin (FTE) (+) increased 3 bps to 3.38 in the third quarter of 2024 from 3.35 for the same period of 2023. The increases in net interest margin and net interest margin (FTE) (+) were primarily driven by the impacts of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments associated with the American National acquisition, as well as higher loan yields, partially offset by increases in interest expense driven primarily by higher market interest rates, changes in deposit mix as depositors move to higher yielding deposit products, as well as increased usage of brokered deposits.

 Our net interest margin and net interest margin (FTE) (+) includes the impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments. Net accretion income related to acquisition accounting was 12.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to approximately 1.1 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 11.6 million due to the impacts from the American National acquisition. The impact of accretion and amortization for the periods presented are reflected in the following table (dollars in thousands):

For the first nine months of 2024, net interest income (FTE) (+) was 526.7 million, an increase of 58.1 million from the same period of 2023. The increases in both net interest income and net interest income (FTE) (+) were primarily the result of a 2.7 billion increase in average interest earning assets and net accretion income, partially offset by a 2.7 billion increase in average interest bearing liabilities, in each case primarily related to the acquisition of American National. In the first nine months of 2024, net interest margin decreased 7 bps to 3.28 from 3.35 in the first nine months of 2023, and net interest margin (FTE)(+) decreased 8 bps to 3.35 in the first nine months of 2024 from 3.43 in the first nine months of 2023. The decreases in net interest margin and net interest margin (FTE)(+) were primarily driven by higher market interest rates, changes in deposit mix as depositors move to higher yielding deposit products, as well as increased usage of brokered deposits, partially offset by higher loan yields, and net accretion income related to acquisition accounting.

Our adjusted operating noninterest income, (+) which excludes gains and losses on sale of AFS securities (gains of 4,000 in 2024 and losses of 27.6 million in 2023) and the gain on sale-leaseback transaction 27.7 million in 2023), increased 7.3 million or 27.0 to 34.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 27.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in adjusted operating noninterest income (+) was primarily due to the impact of the American National acquisition, which drove the majority of the 2.3 million increase in fiduciary and asset management fees, the 1.2 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts, and the 1.1 million increase in interchange fees. In addition to the American National acquisition impact, BOLI income increased 2.1 million primarily due to death benefits received in the third quarter of 2024, other operating income increased 1.9 million primarily due to an increase in equity method investment income, and mortgage banking income increased 548,000 due to an increase in mortgage loan origination volumes and gain on sale margins. These increases were partially offset by a 1.2 million decrease in loan-related interest rate swap fees due to lower transaction volumes and a 630,000 decrease in other service charges, commissions, and fees primarily due to a merchant services vendor contract signing bonus in the prior year.

Our adjusted operating noninterest income (+) , which excludes losses on sale of securities 6.5 million in 2024 and 41.0 million in 2023) and the gain on sale-leaseback transaction 27.7 million in 2023), increased 16.0 million or 21.5 to 90.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 74.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in adjusted operating noninterest income (+) was primarily due to the impact of the American National acquisition, which drove the majority of the 5.4 million increase in fiduciary and asset management fees and the 1.7 million increase in interchange fees. In addition to the American National acquisition impact, other operating income increased 3.7 million primarily due to increases in equity method investment income and capital market transaction-related fees, BOLI income increased 3.4 million primarily due to death benefits received in 2024, service charges on deposit accounts increased 2.9 million primarily due to improved margins in treasury management services, and mortgage banking income increased 1.3 million due to an increase in mortgage loan origination volumes and gain on sale margins. These increases were partially offset by a 2.1 million decrease in loan-related interest rate swap fees due to lower transaction volumes.

Our adjusted operating noninterest expense (+) , which excludes expenses related to strategic cost saving initiatives principally composed of severance charges related to headcount reductions and charges for exiting leases 8.7 million in 2023), merger-related costs 1.4 million in 2024 and 2.0 million in 2023), and amortization of intangible assets 5.8 million in 2024 and 2.2 million in 2023), increased 19.7 million or 20.7 to 115.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 95.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in adjusted operating noninterest expense (+) was primarily due to the impact of the American National acquisition, which drove the majority of the 11.9 million increase in salaries and benefits, the 1.8 million increase in technology and data processing, the 1.8 million increase in occupancy expenses, the 1.0 million increase in FDIC assessment premiums and other insurance, and the 746,000 increase in franchise and other taxes. In addition to the American National acquisition impact, marketing and advertising expense increased 1.1 million and professional services increased 703,000.

These increases were partially offset by a 14.9 million decrease in other expenses primarily due to the prior year s expenses associated with strategic cost saving initiatives. Our adjusted operating noninterest expense (+) , which excludes merger-related costs 33.0 million in 2024 and 2.0 million in 2023), amortization of intangible assets 13.7 million in 2024 and 6.7 million in 2023), expenses related to strategic cost saving initiatives principally composed of severance charges related to headcount reductions and charges for exiting leases 12.6 million in 2023), a legal reserve related to our previously disclosed settlement with the CFPB, included within other expenses 5.0 million in 2023), and a FDIC special assessment 840,000 in 2024), increased 34.1 million or 11.5 to 330.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 296.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in adjusted operating noninterest expense (+) was primarily due to the impact of the American National acquisition, which drove the majority of the 22.7 million increase in salaries and benefits, the 3.8 million increase in occupancy expenses, the 3.5 million increase in technology and data processing, the 2.9 million increase in FDIC assessment premiums and other insurance, and the 1.3 million increase in franchise and other taxes.

The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in net interest income driven by the impact of the American National acquisition and favorable spreads on both the loan and deposit portfolios, as well as a decrease in the provision for credit losses. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in net interest income driven by the impact of the American National acquisition and favorable spreads on both the loan and deposit portfolios. Wholesale Banking s noninterest income also increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to the impact of the American National acquisition, which drove the majority of the increases in fiduciary and asset management fees. The increases in income before income taxes were partially offset by increases in noninterest expense primarily due to the impact of the American National acquisition, which drove the majority of the increases in salaries and benefits.

Consumer Banking s noninterest income also increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to the impact of the American National acquisition, which drove the majority of the increases in fiduciary and asset management fees, interchange fee income, and service charges on deposit accounts.

 INCOME TAXES Our provision for income taxes is based on our results of operations, adjusted for the effect of certain tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses. In addition, we report certain items of income and expense in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. We recognize the tax effects of these temporary differences in the deferred income tax provision or benefit. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statements and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate. As of each reporting date, we consider existing evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. Our bank subsidiary, Atlantic Union Bank, is subject to a bank franchise tax but not a state income tax in Virginia, its primary place of business. We, our subsidiaries, and Atlantic Union Bank s non-bank subsidiaries are subject to Virginia income taxes and may be able to utilize existing state deferred tax assets, depending on a number of factors including those entities financial results. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we reviewed our business plan considering the American National acquisition and other business changes and noted shifts within our state income tax footprint and other factors that impacted projected future realization of state deferred tax items, including those attributable to operations in Virginia. As a result, we concluded it is more likely than not that the benefit for certain state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized, and we recorded a valuation allowance of 4.8 million via a non-cash charge to income tax expense for the second quarter of 2024. There has been no change in the valuation allowance for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 17.0 and 17.6 , respectively. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 19.7 and 16.3 , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the valuation allowance established during the second quarter of 2024, which resulted in a 250 bps increase in the effective tax rate. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION Balance Sheet At September 30, 2024, our consolidated balance sheet includes the impact of the American National acquisition, which closed April 1, 2024. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we adjusted the allocation of the purchase price for certain provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and resulted in a 5.2 million increase, which was recognized during the third quarter of 2024, in the preliminary goodwill initially recognized during the second quarter of 2024, resulting in preliminary goodwill of 287.5 million at September 30, 2024. Assets At September 30, 2024, we had total assets of 24.8 billion, an increase of 3.6 billion or approximately 17.2 from December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was primarily due to an increase in LHFI, net of deferred fees and costs, of 2.7 billion, and the AFS securities portfolio of 376.9 million, in each case, primarily due to the American National acquisition. LHFI were 18.3 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.7 billion or 17.3 from December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, quarterly average LHFI increased 3.2 billion or 21.0 from the same period in the prior year.

Liabilities and Stockholders Equity At September 30, 2024, we had total liabilities of 21.6 billion, an increase of 3.0 billion or approximately 16.2 from December 31, 2023, which was primarily driven by an increase in deposits of 3.5 billion, primarily due to the American National assumed deposits, as well as increased usage of brokered deposits, partially offset by a decrease in total borrowings of 459.7 million. Total deposits at September 30, 2024 were 20.3 billion, an increase of 3.5 billion or approximately 20.7 from December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, quarterly average deposits increased 3.4 billion or 20.1 from the same period in the prior year.

Refer to Deposits within this Item 2 for additional information on this topic. Total borrowings at September 30, 2024 were 852.2 million, a decrease of 459.7 million or 35.0 from December 31, 2023, primarily due to paydowns of short-term borrowings due to deposit growth. Refer to Note 7 Borrowings in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for additional information on our borrowing activity. At September 30, 2024, our stockholders equity was 3.2 billion, an increase of 626.1 million from December 31, 2023. The net increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of common stock as merger consideration in the American National acquisition. Our consolidated regulatory capital ratios continue to exceed the minimum capital requirements and are considered well-capitalized for regulatory purposes. Refer to Capital Resources within this Item 2 , as well as Note 10 "Stockholders Equity" in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for additional information on our capital resources. During the third quarter of 2024, we declared and paid a quarterly dividend on our outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock of 171.88 per share (equivalent to 0.43 per outstanding depositary share), consistent with the fourth quarter of 2023 and the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, we also declared and paid cash dividends of 0.32 per common share, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2023 and an increase of 0.02 per share or 6.7 from the third quarter of 2023.

 SECURITIES At September 30, 2024, we had total investments of 3.5 billion or 14.2 of total assets as compared to 3.2 billion or 15.0 of total assets at December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the American National acquisition. We seek to diversify our portfolio to minimize risk, and we focus on purchasing MBS for cash flow and reinvestment opportunities and securities issued by states and political subdivisions due to the tax benefits and the higher yield offered from these securities. The majority of our MBS are agency-backed securities, which have a government guarantee. For information regarding the hedge transaction related to AFS securities, see Note 9 Derivatives in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.

Weighted average yield is calculated as the tax-equivalent yield on a pro rata basis for each security based on its relative amortized cost. As of September 30, 2024, we maintained a diversified municipal bond portfolio with approximately 67 of our holdings in general obligation issues and the majority of the remainder primarily backed by revenue bonds. Issuances within the State of Texas represented 19 of the total municipal portfolio; no other state had a concentration above 10 . Substantially all municipal holdings are considered investment grade. When purchasing municipal securities, we focus on strong underlying ratings for general obligation issuers or bonds backed by essential service revenues. LIQUIDITY Liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management. Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is our customer deposit base generated by our wholesale and consumer businesses. Total deposits at September 30, 2024 were 20.3 billion, an increase of 3.5 billion or approximately 20.7 from December 31, 2023. Total deposits increased from December 31, 2023, primarily due to a 3.0 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits, which included 2.2 billion of interest-bearing customer deposits and 460.0 million in demand deposits, primarily due to the American National acquisition, as well as an increase of 870.0 million in brokered deposits. Refer to Deposits within this Item 2 for additional information on this topic. We closely monitor changes in the industry and market conditions that may impact our liquidity and will use other borrowing means or other liquidity and funding strategies sources to fund our liquidity needs as needed. We also closely track the potential impacts on our liquidity from declines in the fair value of our securities portfolio due to changing market interest rates and developments in the banking industry that may change the availability of traditional sources of liquidity or market expectations with respect to available sources and amounts of additional liquidity. We consider our liquid assets to include cash, interest-bearing deposits with banks, money market investments, federal funds sold, LHFS, and securities and loans maturing or re-pricing within one year. As of September 30, 2024, our liquid assets totaled 8.8 billion or 35.6 of total assets, and liquid earning assets totaled 8.6 billion or 38.7 of total earning assets. We also provide asset liquidity by managing loan and securities maturities and cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, loan payments of approximately 7.9 billion or 43.4 of total LHFI are expected within one year based on contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments, and approximately 326.5 million or 9.2 of total investments as of September 30, 2024 are scheduled to be paid down within one year based on contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments. Additional sources of liquidity available to us include our capacity to borrow additional funds when necessary through federal funds lines with several correspondent banks, a line of credit with the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Discount Window, the purchase of brokered certificates of deposit, a corporate line of credit with a large correspondent bank, and debt and capital issuances. Management believes our overall liquidity to be sufficient to satisfy our depositors requirements and to meet our customers credit needs.

 For additional information and the available balances on various lines of credit, please refer to Note 7 Borrowings in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. In addition to lines of credit, we may also borrow additional funds by purchasing certificates of deposit through a nationally recognized network of financial institutions. Cash Requirements Our cash requirements, outside of lending transactions, consist primarily of borrowings, debt and capital instruments, which are used as part of our overall liquidity and capital management strategy. We expect that the cash required to repay these obligations will be sourced from our general liquidity sources and future debt and capital issuances as described above under Liquidity within this Item 2. The following table presents our contractual obligations related to our major cash requirements and the scheduled payments due at the various intervals over the next year and beyond as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 

Less than More than Total 1 year 1 year Long-term debt (1) 250,000 250,000 Trust preferred capital notes (1) 184,542 184,542 Leases (2) 117,590 3,734 113,856 Repurchase agreements 59,227 59,227 Total contractual obligations 611,359 62,961 548,398 

 (1) Excludes related unamortized premium/discount and interest payments. (2) Represents lease payments due on non-cancellable operating leases at September 30, 2024. Excluded from these tables are variable lease payments or renewals. For more information pertaining to the previous table, reference Note 6 Leases and Note 7 Borrowings in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Off-Balance Sheet Obligations In the normal course of business, we are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers and to reduce our own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of our involvement in particular classes of financial instruments. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, we do not require collateral or other security to support off-balance sheet financial instruments with credit risk. For a summary of our total commitments with off-balance sheet risk see Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report. We are also a lessor in sales-type and direct financing leases for equipment, as noted in Note 6 Leases in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report. Our future commitments related to the aforementioned leases totaled 578.7 million and 472.7 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, we entered into forward sale agreements in connection with our proposed merger with Sandy Spring. For more information, see Recent Events Forward Sale Agreement .

 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices Our financial statements included in Item I Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the financial position and operating results to be measured principally in terms of historic dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Inflation affects our results of operations mainly through increased operating costs, but since nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, changes in interest rates generally affect our financial condition to a greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation. Although interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Management reviews pricing of our products and services, in light of current and expected costs due to inflation, to seek to mitigate the inflationary impact on our financial performance. LOAN PORTFOLIO LHFI, net of deferred fees and costs, totaled 18.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and 15.6 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily driven by the increase in LHFI from the acquisition of American National . Total CRE and commercial and industrial loans represented our largest loan categories at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We remain committed to originating soundly underwritten loans to qualifying borrowers within our markets.

CRE loans consist of term loans secured by a mortgage lien on the real property and include both non-owner occupied and owner occupied CRE loans, as well as construction and land development, multifamily real estate, and residential 1-4 family-commercial loans. CRE loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans and depend on cash flows from the owner s business or the property s tenants to service the debt. The borrower s cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions, a downturn in the local economy, or in occupancy rates in the market where the property is located, any of which could increase the likelihood of default. We seek to mitigate risks attributable to our most highly concentrated portfolios and our portfolios that pose unique risks to our balance sheet through our credit underwriting and monitoring processes, including oversight by a centralized credit administration function, approval process, credit policy, and risk management committee, as well as through our seasoned bankers that focus on lending to borrowers with proven track records in markets that we are familiar with. All construction lending risk is controlled by a centralized construction loan servicing department that independently reviews and approves each draw request, including assessing on-going budget adequacy, and monitors project completion milestones. When underwriting CRE loans, we require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, cash flows in excess of expected debt service

 requirements, and equity investment in the project. As part of the CRE loan origination process, we also stress test loan interest rates and occupancy rates to determine the impact of different economic conditions on the borrower s ability to maintain adequate debt service. We also manage our CRE exposure through product type limits, individual loan-size limits for CRE product types, client relationship limits, and transactional risk acceptance criteria, as well as other techniques, including but not limited to, loan syndications/participations, collateral, guarantees, structure, covenants, and other risk reduction techniques. Our CRE loan policies are specific to individual product types and underwriting parameters vary depending on the risk profile of each asset class. We evaluate risk concentrations regularly in our CRE portfolio on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client basis, and regularly review and adjust as appropriate our lending strategies and CRE product-specific approach to underwriting in light of market conditions and our overall corporate strategy and initiatives. The average loan size of our CRE portfolio was approximately 1.1 million and 1.2 million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and the median loan size in our CRE portfolio was approximately 239,000 as of September 30, 2024 and approximately 273,000 as of December 31, 2023. The following table presents the composition of our CRE loan categories, including the industry classification for CRE non-owner occupied loans, and CRE loans as a percentage of total loans for the periods ended (dollars in thousands ):

In particular, the repayment of loans secured by non-owner occupied commercial properties depend primarily on the tenant s continuing ability to pay rent to the property owner, who is our borrower, or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner s ability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, or if leases are not obtained or renewed, the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Due to these risks, we proactively monitor our non-owner occupied CRE and multifamily real estate exposures and evaluate these portfolios against our established lending policies, and we believe this monitoring and evaluation helps ensure that these portfolios are geographically diverse and granular . We do not currently monitor owner-occupied CRE loans based on geographical markets as the primary source of repayment for these loans is predicated on the cash flow from the underlying operating entity, which is generally less dependent on conditions in the relevant commercial real estate market. These loans are generally located within our geographical footprint and are generally distributed across industries.

 (1) The office portfolio is a subset of our CRE non-owner occupied loans included in the column to the left. The shift to work-from-home and hybrid work environments have caused a decreased utilization of office space. As such, we have additional monitoring for our exposure to office space, within our non-owner occupied CRE portfolio, including periodic credit risk assessment of expiring office leases for most of the office portfolio. We do not currently finance large, high-rise, or major metropolitan central business district office buildings, and the office portfolio is generally in suburban markets with strong occupancy levels. The average loan size in our office portfolio was approximately 1.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and 1.9 million as of December 31, 2023, and the median loan size in our office portfolio was approximately 574,000 as of September 30, 2024 and approximately 647,000 as of December 31, 2023. The average loan size in our multifamily portfolio was approximately 2.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and 3.2 million as of December 31, 2023, and the median loan size in our multifamily portfolio was approximately 649,000 as of September 30, 2024 and approximately 793,000 as of December 31, 2023. ASSET QUALITY Overview At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, nonaccrual LHFI was 36.8 million and 36.9 million, respectively, while NPAs as a percentage of LHFI totaled 0.20 and 0.24 , respectively. Net charge-offs were 7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of 6.4 million for the same period in the prior year. Our ACL at September 30, 2024 increased 29.2 million from December 31, 2023 to 177.6 million, primarily due to the American National acquisition, organic loan growth during 2024, and the impact of continued uncertainty in the economic outlook on certain portfolios. In connection with the American National acquisition, we recorded an initial ACL of 18.5 million that consisted of an ALLL of 17.1 million, which included a 3.9 million reserve on acquired PCD loans. We also recorded a 13.2 million reserve on non-PCD loans established through provision expense, which represents the CECL double count of the non-PCD credit mark, and a 1.4 million RUC through the provision for credit losses. We continue to experience historically low levels of NPAs; however, the economic environment in our footprint could be impacted by elevated inflation, even as inflation rates begin to improve, and the potential impact of interest rate changes as the Federal Reserve continues to evaluate monetary policy moves, which could increase NPAs in future periods. We continue to refrain from originating or purchasing loans from foreign entities, and we selectively originate loans to higher risk borrowers. Our loan portfolio generally does not include exposure to option adjustable-rate mortgage products, high loan-to-value ratio mortgages, interest only mortgage loans, subprime mortgage loans, or mortgage loans with initial teaser rates, which are all considered higher risk instruments. Nonperforming Assets At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, NPAs totaled 37.3 million and 36.9 million, respectively, representing an increase of 0.4 million. Our NPAs as a percentage of total outstanding LHFI at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 0.20 and 0.24 , respectively.

Of the total past due LHFI still accruing interest, 15.2 million or 0.08 of total LHFI were loans past due 90 days or more at September 30, 2024, compared to 13.9 million or 0.09 of total LHFI at December 31, 2023. Troubled Loan Modifications As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had TLMs of 24.5 million and 29.4 million, respectively. There were no unfunded commitments on loans modified and designated as TLMs for September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2023, there was 1.5 million of unfunded commitments on loans modified and designated as TLMs since January 1, 2023. Net Charge-offs For the third quarter of 2024, net charge-offs were 0.7 million or 0.01 of total average LHFI on an annualized basis, compared to net charge-offs of 0.3 million or 0.01 for the same quarter last year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs were 7.3 million or 0.06 of total average LHFI on an annualized basis, compared to net charge-offs of 6.4 million or 0.06 as of September 30, 2023. Provision for Credit Losses We recorded a provision for credit losses of 2.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 2.4 million compared to the provision for credit losses of 5.0 million recorded during the same quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 reflected a provision of 3.2 million for loan losses and a 0.6 million release in provision for unfunded commitments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 32.6 million, an increase of 9.7 million compared to provision for credit losses of 22.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2024 reflected a provision of 31.9 million for loan losses and a 0.7 million provision for unfunded commitments. Included in the provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2024 was 13.2 million of initial provision expense on non-PCD loans and 1.4 million on unfunded commitments, each acquired from American National. Allowance for Credit Losses At September 30, 2024, the ACL was 177.6 million and included an ALLL of 160.7 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of 16.9 million. The ACL at September 30, 2024 increased 29.2 million from December 31, 2023, primarily

 DEPOSITS As of September 30, 2024, our total deposits were 20.3 billion, an increase of 3.5 billion or 20.7 from December 31, 2023, primarily driven by the increase in deposits from the acquisition of American National. Total interest-bearing deposits consisted of interest checking accounts, money market, savings, time deposits, and brokered deposits. Our total time deposit balances with customers totaled 4.0 billion and accounted for 27.4 of total interest-bearing customer deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to 2.8 billion and 23.1 at December 31, 2023. We expect to continue to use purchased brokered deposits as part of our overall liquidity management strategy, on an as needed basis, which are generally purchased through nationally recognized networks. At September 30, 2024, our brokered deposits totaled 1.4 billion, a 869.9 million increase from December 31, 2023.

 CAPITAL RESOURCES Capital resources represent funds, earned or obtained, over which financial institutions can exercise greater or longer control in comparison with deposits and borrowed funds. Our management reviews our capital adequacy on an ongoing basis with reference to size, composition, and quality of our resources and consistency with regulatory requirements and industry standards. We seek to maintain a capital structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses, while allowing us to effectively leverage our capital to maximize return to shareholders. Under the Basel III capital rules, we must comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0 of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 of risk-weighted assets; (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5 of risk-weighted assets; and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0 of total assets. These ratios, with the exception of the leverage ratio, include a 2.5 capital conservation buffer, which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. On August 26, 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a final rule that allowed us to phase in the impact of adopting the CECL methodology up to two years, with a three-year transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the two-year delay. We elected to phase in the regulatory capital impact as permitted under this final rule. The CECL transition amount is being phased out of regulatory capital over a three-year period that began in 2022 and ends in 2024.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES In this Quarterly Report, we have provided supplemental performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are a supplement to GAAP, which is used to prepare our financial statements, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. We use the non-GAAP financial measures discussed herein in our analysis of our performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of our results of operations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods presented without the impact of items or events that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. We believe interest and dividend income (FTE), which is used in computing yield on interest-earning assets (FTE), provides valuable additional insight into the yield on interest-earning assets (FTE) by adjusting for differences in the tax treatment of interest income sources. We believe net interest income (FTE) and total revenue (FTE), which are used in computing net interest margin (FTE), provide valuable additional insight into the net interest margin by adjusting for differences in the tax treatment of interest income sources. The entire FTE adjustment is attributable to interest income on earning assets, which is used in computing the yield on earning assets. Interest expense and the related cost of interest-bearing liabilities and cost of funds ratios are not affected by the FTE components. The following table reconciles non-GAAP financial measures from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

 Tangible assets and tangible common equity are used in the calculation of certain profitability, capital, and per share ratios. We believe tangible assets, tangible common equity and the related ratios are meaningful measures of capital adequacy because they provide a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which we believe will assist investors in assessing our capital and our ability to absorb potential losses. We believe tangible common equity is an important indication of our ability to grow organically and through business combinations as well as our ability to pay dividends and to engage in various capital management strategies.

 Adjusted operating noninterest expense excludes, as applicable, expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, merger-related costs, FDIC special assessments, strategic cost saving initiatives (principally composed of severance charges related to headcount reductions and charges for exiting leases), and legal reserves associated with our previously disclosed settlement with the CFPB. Adjusted operating noninterest income excludes gain (loss) on sale of securities and gain on sale-leaseback transaction. These measures are similar to the measures we use when analyzing corporate performance and are also similar to the measure used for incentive compensation.

Our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk. Our ALCO is responsible for reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to this risk. Our Board of Directors reviews and approves the policies established by our ALCO. We monitor interest rate risk using three complementary modeling tools: static gap analysis, earnings simulation modeling, and economic value simulation (net present value estimation). Each of these models measures changes in a variety of interest rate scenarios. While each of the interest rate risk models has limitations, taken together, they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of our interest rate risk, the distribution of risk along the yield curve, the level of risk through time, and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships. We use the static gap analysis, which measures aggregate re-pricing values, less often because it does not effectively consider the optionality embedded into many assets and liabilities and, therefore, we do not address it here. We use earnings simulation and economic value simulation models on a regular basis, which more effectively measure the cash flow and optionality impacts, and these models are discussed below. We determine the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then we create policies and practices governing asset generation and pricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments. These policies and practices are based on management s expectations regarding future interest rate movements, the states of the national, regional and local economies, and other financial and business risk factors. We use simulation modeling to measure and monitor the effect of various interest rate scenarios and business strategies on our net interest income. This modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net interest income and net income over specified time horizons.

 Earnings Simulation Modeling Management uses earnings simulation modeling to measure the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates. The model calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates. This method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process, but we believe it provides a better analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analyses, such as the static gap analysis noted above. We derive the assumptions used in the model from historical trends and management s outlook, including expected loan growth, loan prepayment rates, projected loan origination spreads, deposit growth rates, changes to deposit product betas and non-maturity deposit decay rates, and projected yields and rates. These assumptions may not be realized and unanticipated events and circumstances may also occur that cause the assumptions to be inaccurate. The model also does not take into account any future actions of management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes. Our ALCO monitors the assumptions at least quarterly and periodically adjusts them as it deems appropriate. In the modeling, we assume that all maturities, calls, and prepayments in the securities portfolio are reinvested in like instruments, and we base the MBS prepayment assumptions on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning. We also use different interest rate scenarios and yield curves to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates. Interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the short-term market rate changes and these differences are reflected in the different rate scenarios. We adjust deposit betas, decay rates and loan prepayment speeds periodically in our models for non-maturity deposits and loans. We use our earnings simulation model to estimate earnings in rate environments where rates are instantaneously shocked up or down around a most likely rate scenario, based on implied forward rates and futures curves. The analysis assesses the impact on net interest income over a 12-month period after an immediate increase or shock in rates, of 100 bps up to 300 bps. The model, under all scenarios, does not drop the index below zero. The following table represents the interest rate sensitivity on our net interest income across the rate paths modeled for balances as of the quarterly periods ended: 

Change In Net Interest Income September 30, December 31, September 30, 2024 2023 2023 Change in Yield Curve: +300 bps 10.61 4.41 7.26 +200 bps 7.44 3.20 4.97 +100 bps 3.95 1.79 2.66 Most likely rate scenario -100 bps (3.09) (1.68) (1.64) -200 bps (7.31) (3.92) (5.48) -300 bps (12.86) (7.62) (9.72) If an institution is asset sensitive its assets reprice more quickly than its liabilities and net interest income would be expected to increase in a rising interest rate environment and decrease in a falling interest rate environment. If an institution is liability sensitive its liabilities reprice more quickly than its assets and net interest income would be expected to decrease in a rising interest rate environment and increase in a falling interest rate environment. From a net interest income perspective, we were more asset sensitive as of September 30, 2024 compared to our positions as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. This shift is due, in part, to the changing market characteristics of certain loan and deposit products and, in part, due to various other balance sheet strategies. We expect net interest income to increase with an immediate increase or shock in market rates. In a decreasing interest rate environment, we would expect a decline in net interest income as interest-earning assets re-price more quickly than interest-bearing deposits.

 Economic Value Simulation Modeling We use economic value simulation modeling to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments. We calculate the economic values based on discounted cash flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities. The change in net economic value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer-term earnings capability of the balance sheet. We use the same assumptions in the economic value simulation model as in the earnings simulation model. The economic value simulation model uses instantaneous rate shocks to the balance sheet. The following table reflects the estimated change in net economic value over different rate environments using economic value simulation for the balances as of the periods ended: 

Change In Economic Value of Equity September 30, December 31, September 30, 2024 2023 2023 Change in Yield Curve: +300 basis points (6.61) (8.11) (8.54) +200 basis points (4.36) (5.36) (5.89) +100 basis points (2.17) (2.53) (3.06) Most likely rate scenario -100 basis points 1.28 2.34 2.94 -200 basis points 0.12 3.07 3.38 -300 basis points (3.05) 0.76 2.25 As of September 30, 2024, our economic value of equity is generally less liability sensitive in a rising interest rate environment compared to our positions as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, primarily due to the composition of our Consolidated Balance Sheets and also due to the pricing characteristics and assumptions of certain deposits. A decrease in interest rates may have an adverse impact if our asset yields reprice faster than our deposits or if we are not able to reduce our deposit rates in a declining rate scenario. ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. In designing and evaluating the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the ordinary course of our operations, we are party to various legal proceedings. Based on the information presently available, and after consultation with legal counsel, management believes that the ultimate outcome in such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our business or the financial condition or results of operations. As previously disclosed, on February 9, 2022, pursuant to the CFPB s Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise process, the CFPB Office of Enforcement notified the Bank that it was considering recommending that the CFPB take legal action against the Bank in connection with alleged violations of Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. 1005.17, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act, 12 U.S.C. 5531 and 5536, in connection with the Bank s overdraft practices and policies. In March 2023, the CFPB commenced settlement discussions with us, and on December 7, 2023, the Bank entered into a Consent Order with the CFPB to resolve the matter. A copy of the Consent Order is available on the CFPB s website. The terms of the Consent Order require, among other things, that the Bank submit a redress plan to the CFPB pursuant to which the Bank will pay restitution in an amount of at least 5.0 million to certain current and former customers of the Bank who opted-in to the Bank s discretionary overdraft service during a specified time period and pay a 1.2 million civil monetary penalty. See Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report for additional information. ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Except as described below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. An investment in our securities involves risks. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, including the information addressed under Forward-Looking Statements, investors in our securities should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K. These factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and capital position and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report, in which case the trading price of our securities could decline. Risks Related to the Proposed Merger with Sandy Spring The dilution caused by the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the merger may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We expect to issue approximately 41 million shares of our common stock as Merger Consideration to Sandy Spring stockholders, and assuming full physical settlement, we expect to issue 11,338,028 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Forward Sale Agreement. The dilution caused by the issuance of the new shares of our common stock may result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, including a stock price decrease. Combining the Company and Sandy Spring may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, we will begin the process of integrating Sandy Spring. A successful integration of its business with ours will depend substantially on our ability to consolidate operations, corporate cultures, systems and procedures, to eliminate redundancies and to realize the anticipated cost savings. If we and Sandy Spring are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings and anticipated benefits of the 

 - 91 - 

Table of Contents 
 merger could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional unforeseen expenses. We may not be able to combine our business with the business of Sandy Spring without encountering difficulties that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with existing clients, customers, depositors and employees, such as: the loss of key employees; the disruption of operations and business; inability to maintain and increase competitive presence; loan and deposit attrition, customer loss and revenue loss; additional costs or unexpected problems with operations, personnel, technology and credit; inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; and/or problems with the assimilation of new operations, systems, sites or personnel, which could divert resources from regular banking operations. Any disruption to the businesses could cause customers to remove their accounts and move their business to a competing financial institution. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. Additionally, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our successful integration of Sandy Spring. Further, we entered into the merger agreement to acquire Sandy Spring with the expectation that the acquisition will result in various benefits including, among other things, benefits relating to enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position for the combined company, cross selling opportunities, technological efficiencies, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we integrate Sandy Spring in an efficient, effective and timely manner, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits on the anticipated timeframe, or at all, could result in a reduction in the price of our common stock as well as in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, we will make fair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities in recording the acquisition. Actual values of these assets and liabilities could differ from our estimates, which could result in our not achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings. We and Sandy Spring have operated and, until the completion of the merger, must continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our ongoing business, inability to maintain and increase competitive presence, additional costs or unexpected problems with operations, personnel, technology and credit, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect each company s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. Integration efforts may also divert management attention during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger, which may have an adverse effect on the combined company. We and Sandy Spring have, and the combined company following the merger will, incur significant transaction and merger-related costs in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. We and Sandy Spring have incurred and expect to incur significant non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of Sandy Spring with our operations. These costs include legal, financial advisory, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees, severance/employment-related costs, public company filing fees and other regulatory fees, printing costs and other related costs. We have begun collecting information to formulate detailed integration plans to deliver anticipated cost savings. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our business with the business of Sandy Spring, and there are many factors beyond our or Sandy Spring s control that could affect the total amount or timing of integration costs. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. Whether or not the merger is consummated, we, Sandy Spring and the combined company will incur substantial expenses in pursuing the merger and this may adversely impact our and the combined company s earnings. Completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be conditioned upon customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required governmental authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, including approval by certain federal banking regulators, and required approvals from our shareholders and Sandy Spring stockholders. We and Sandy Spring intend to pursue all

Table of Contents 
 required approvals in accordance with the merger agreement. However, there can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained without additional cost, on the anticipated timeframe, or at all. Completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be conditioned upon customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required governmental authorizations, consents, orders, and approvals, including approval by certain federal banking regulators, and required approvals from our shareholders and Sandy Spring stockholders. Regulatory approvals for the merger and/or related subsidiary bank merger may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not currently anticipated, cannot be met, or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger and/or related subsidiary bank merger. Before the proposed merger and related subsidiary bank merger may be completed, various approvals, consents and non-objections must be obtained from bank regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve. In determining whether to grant these approvals, regulatory authorities consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party. These approvals could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to any or all of the following: an adverse development in any party s regulatory standing or any other factors considered by regulators in granting such approvals; governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition or changes in legislation or the political or regulatory environment generally, including as a result of changes of the U.S. executive administration, or Congressional leadership and regulatory agency leadership. Even if the approvals are granted, they may impose terms and conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company s business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions or that such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were completed successfully within the expected timeframe. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger. The completion of the merger is conditioned on the receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals without the imposition of any materially burdensome regulatory condition and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods. Additionally, the completion of the merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions or decrees issued by any court or any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that would prevent, prohibit or make illegal the completion of the merger, the related subsidiary bank merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Despite the parties expected commitment to use their reasonable best efforts to respond to any request for information and resolve any objection that may be asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the merger agreement, neither party is required under the terms of the merger agreement to take any action, commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction in connection with obtaining these approvals, that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the proposed merger (measured on a scale relative only to the size of Sandy Spring and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (without the Company and its subsidiaries)). The merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed. Such failure to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement could cause our results to be adversely affected, our stock price to decline or have a material and adverse effect on our stock price and results of operations. If the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, are not completed for any reason, including as a result of our shareholders failing to approve the merger agreement or the issuance of the shares of our common stock constituting the Merger Consideration (the Share Issuance or Sandy Spring stockholders failing to approve the merger agreement, there may be various adverse consequences, and we and/or Sandy Spring may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our respective customers and employees. For example, either party s business may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of its management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger. Moreover, our stock price may decline because costs related to such transactions, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, must be paid even if such transactions, including the merger, are not completed. Moreover, we may be required to pay a termination fee of 56.0 million to Sandy Spring upon a termination of the merger agreement in certain circumstances. In addition, if the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are not completed, whether because of our failure to receive required regulatory approvals in a timely fashion or because one of the parties has breached its obligations in a way that permits Sandy Spring to terminate the merger agreement, or for any other reason, our stock price may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market

 assumption that the merger will be beneficial and will be completed. We and/or Sandy Spring also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to proceedings commenced against either company to perform our obligations under the merger agreement. The market price for our common stock following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected or currently affect our common stock and Sandy Spring common stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, upon completion of the merger, holders of shares of Sandy Spring common stock will receive shares of our common stock as Merger Consideration. The combined company s business and financial position will differ from our and Sandy Spring s respective businesses and financial positions before the completion of the merger and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting our results of operations and those currently affecting the results of operations of Sandy Spring. Accordingly, the market price and performance of our common stock is likely to be different from the performance of our common stock in the absence of the merger. In addition, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Upon completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, we will be subject to the risks related to Sandy Spring s business, including its commercial real estate loan portfolio. Upon completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, we will be subject to risks related to Sandy Spring s business and take on its loans, investments and other obligations. This will increase our credit risk and, if such obligations are not repaid or losses are incurred on such obligations, there could be material and adverse effects on our business. Additionally, where our businesses overlap, any risks we face may be increased due to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. For example, we and Sandy Spring each have significant credit exposure in commercial real estate. At September 30, 2024, Sandy Spring s commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled 7.9 billion, or 68 of its total loan portfolio, which includes 1.7 billion of commercial owner-occupied real estate loans. A large concentration of commercial real estate loans in the combined company involves additional risks because the value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in any of the geographic bank markets in which such real estate is located, as well as because funds for acquisition, development and construction loans AD C loans are advanced based on estimates of costs and the estimated value of the completed project and therefore have a greater risk of default in a weaker economy. Construction projects require prudent underwriting, including determination of a borrower s ability to complete the project, while staying within budget and on time in accordance with construction plans. Economic events, supply chain issues, labor market disruptions, and other factors outside the control of Sandy Spring and our control, or that of the borrowers, could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of affected properties. At, or shortly after, the completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, we and/or Sandy Spring expect to sell approximately 2.0 billion of the commercial real estate loans originally issued by Sandy Spring Bank and/or Atlantic Union Bank to one or more unrelated third parties after a bidding process. When complete, it is expected that the sale would reduce the combined company s commercial real estate concentration, improve its loan/deposit liquidity profile, and bring the capital ratios of the newly combined entity closer in line with those we maintain pre-merger. However, there is no assurance that we or Sandy Spring will be able to find a prospective purchaser before the consummation of the merger or sell the loans at a price or other terms acceptable to us. Integrating Sandy Spring s commercial real estate loans to our existing portfolio may exacerbate the existing risks we already undertake with our own portfolio comprised meaningfully of commercial real estate loans, as described in our 2023 10-K under Item 1A. Risk Factors We have significant credit exposure in commercial real estate, which may expose us to additional credit risks, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may result in new ones. As a result of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and our acquisition of Sandy Spring, we will record goodwill in connection with such acquisition, and if it becomes impaired, our earnings could be significantly impacted. Under current accounting methods, goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. In connection with our acquisition of Sandy Spring, we will record goodwill in the fair value amount of such acquisition. Although we do not anticipate impairment charges, if we conclude that some portion of such goodwill is impaired, a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded against earnings. 

 - 94 - 

Table of Contents 
 A goodwill impairment charge could be caused by a decline in our stock price or the occurrence of a triggering event that compounds negative financial results. Further, because a large portion of Sandy Spring s portfolio is secured by commercial real estate loans, if such portfolio were to be seen as less valuable in a deteriorating real estate market, or if we and/or Sandy Spring were to sell a portion of Sandy Spring s commercial real estate loans at a less favorable price following the acquisition, we may be required to record an impairment on our acquisition of Sandy Spring. Therefore, following the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, and our recording of goodwill in connection therewith, if such goodwill becomes impaired, our earnings could be significantly and adversely affected. The future results of the combined company following the merger may suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations. Following the merger, the size of the business of the combined company will increase significantly beyond the current size of either our or Sandy Spring s business. The combined company s future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which may pose challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. The combined company may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the significant increase in the size of its business. Both Atlantic Union Bank and Sandy Spring Bank are regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve as well as the CFPB. In addition, at the state level, Atlantic Union Bank is chartered by the Commonwealth of Virginia and is supervised and regularly examined by the Bureau of Financial Institutions, a division of the Virginia State Corporation Commission while Sandy Spring Bank is a state-chartered bank and trust company subject to supervision by the Office of Financial Regulation, part of the Maryland Department of Labor. The laws, regulations and regulatory guidance applicable to both banks will therefore differ in ways that may affect the operations of the combined company. Additionally, the internal policies of Atlantic Union Bank and Sandy Spring Bank with regards to their investment portfolios may differ on factors such as hold limits per bond issuer, life of the bond, or credit risk appetite. As a result, there are assets on the balance sheet of Sandy Spring Bank that the bank subsidiary of the combined company is not expected to hold, whether based on differences in regulatory oversight or internal policies, and we may dispose of such assets contemporaneous or subsequent to the closing of the merger. The disposition of certain assets in a high-interest rate environment, such as we have in the past experienced, are currently experiencing and may experience again in the future, could result in a sale of assets at a market price that is different than the estimated book value of such assets and impact regulatory capital ratios at the time of the closing of the merger. Further, we may replace such disposed assets with lower-yielding investments, any of which could impact our future earnings and return on equity. There can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings or other benefits currently anticipated from the merger. We and Sandy Spring will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending. Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, customers (including depositors and borrowers), suppliers and vendors may have an adverse effect on us and Sandy Spring. These uncertainties may impair our and Sandy Spring s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and customers (including depositors and borrowers) until the merger is completed, as such personnel and customers may experience uncertainty about their future roles and relationships following the completion of the merger. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause customers and others that deal with us or Sandy Spring to seek to change existing business relationships with us or Sandy Spring or fail to extend an existing relationship with us or Sandy Spring, as applicable. Competitors may target each party s existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the merger. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, we and Sandy Spring have agreed to operate our respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material respects before closing, and we and Sandy Spring have agreed not to take certain actions, which could cause us or Sandy Spring to be unable to pursue other beneficial opportunities that may arise before the completion of the merger. Shareholder litigation could prevent or delay the completion of the merger or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Shareholders of Atlantic Union and/or stockholders of Sandy Spring may file lawsuits against the Company, Sandy Spring and/or the directors and officers of either company in connection with the merger. One of the conditions to the closing is that no law, order, injunction or decree issued by any court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that would prevent, 

 - 95 - 

Table of Contents 
 prohibit or make illegal the completion of the merger, the subsidiary bank merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement be in effect. If any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the Company or Sandy Spring from completing the merger, the subsidiary bank merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the merger and could result in significant costs to either party, including any cost associated with the indemnification of its directors and officers. We and Sandy Spring may incur costs relating to the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with the merger. Shareholder lawsuits may divert management attention from management of each company s business or operations. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on such party s business, financial condition and results of operations and could prevent or delay the completion of the merger. The merger will not be completed unless important conditions are satisfied or waived, including approval of the merger agreement by our shareholders and Sandy Spring stockholders and approval of the Share Issuance by our shareholders. Specified conditions set forth in the merger agreement must be satisfied or waived to complete the merger. If the conditions are not satisfied or, subject to applicable law, waived, the merger will not occur or will be delayed and each of Sandy Spring and us may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the merger.
