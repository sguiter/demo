 beds at facilities, including idle facilities, and also includes the provision of reentry and electronic monitoring and supervision services for thousands of individuals, including an array of technology products including radio frequency, GPS, and alcohol monitoring devices. GEO operated as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2020. As a REIT, the Company provided services and conducted other business activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"). A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that is subject to applicable corporate income tax rates and certain qualification requirements. The Company's use of TRSs permitted GEO to engage in certain business activities in which the REIT could not engage directly, so long as those activities were conducted in entities that elected to be treated as TRSs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and enabled GEO to, among other things, provide correctional services at facilities it owns and at facilities owned by its government partners. A TRS is not subject to the distribution requirements applicable to REITs so it may retain income generated by its operations for reinvestment. On December 2, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the "Board") unanimously approved a plan to terminate the Company's REIT status and become a taxable C Corporation, effective for the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result, the Company is no longer required to operate under REIT rules, including the requirement to distribute at least of REIT taxable income to its stockholders, which provides the Company with greater flexibility to use its free cash flow. Effective January 1, 2021, the Company is subject to federal and state income taxes on its taxable income at applicable tax rates and is no longer entitled to a tax deduction for dividends paid. The Company operated as a REIT for the 2020 tax year, and existing REIT requirements and limitations remained in place until December 31, 2020. The Board also voted unanimously to discontinue the Company's quarterly dividend. The Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP and the instructions to Form 10-Q and consequently do not include all disclosures required by Form 10-K. The accounting policies followed for quarterly financial reporting are the same as those disclosed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2024 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The accompanying December 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet has been derived from those audited financial statements. Additional information may be obtained by referring to the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information for the interim periods reported in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been made. Results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year ending December 31, 2024, or for any other future interim or annual periods.

Restricted stock outstanding at September 30, 2024 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted approximately shares of restricted stock to certain employees and executive officers. Of these awards, are market and performance-based awards which will be forfeited if the Company does not achieve certain annual metrics during 2024, 2025 and 2026. On July 8, 2024, the Company granted shares of restricted stock to its newly appointed Chief Financial Officer which are also market and performance-based awards which will be forfeited if the Company does not achieve certain annual metrics during 2024, 2025 and 2026. The vesting of these performance-based restricted stock grants are subject to the achievement by GEO of annual performance metrics as follows: (i) up to of the shares of restricted stock ("TSR Target Award") can vest at the end of a performance period if GEO meets certain total shareholder return ("TSR") performance targets, as compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group of companies, over a three year period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026 and (ii) up to of the shares of restricted stock ("ROCE Target Award") can vest at the end of a three year period if GEO meets certain return on capital employed ("ROCE") performance targets over a period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026. These market and performance awards can vest at between and of the target awards for both metrics. The number of shares shown for the performance-based awards is based on the target awards for both metrics. The metric related to ROCE is considered to be a performance condition. For share-based awards that contain a performance condition, the achievement of the targets must be probable before any share-based compensation expense is recorded. The Company reviews the likelihood of which target in the range will be achieved and if deemed probable, compensation expense is recorded at that time. If subsequent to initial measurement there is a change in the estimate of the probability of meeting the performance condition, the effect of the change in the estimated quantity of awards expected to vest is recognized by cumulatively adjusting compensation expense. If ultimately the performance targets are not met, for any awards where vesting was previously deemed probable, previously recognized compensation expense will be reversed in the period in which vesting is no longer deemed probable. The fair value of these awards was determined based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The metric related to TSR is considered to be a market condition. For share-based awards that contain a market condition, the probability of satisfying the market condition must be considered in the estimate of grant-date fair value and previously recorded compensation expense is not reversed if the market condition is never met. The fair value of these awards was determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation, which calculates a range of possible outcomes and the probabilities that they will occur, using the following weighted average key assumptions: (i) volatility of ; (ii) beta of ; and (iii) risk free rate of . For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized million, of compensation expense related to its restricted stock awards. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million of unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested restricted stock awards, including non-vested restricted stock awards with performance-based and market-based vesting, that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years.

interest rate swap agreements in the aggregate notional amount of million to fix the interest rate on certain of its variable rate debt to . The Company has designated these interest rate swaps as hedges against changes in the cash flows of two identical promissory notes (the "Notes") which are secured by loan agreements and mortgage and security agreements on certain real property and improvements. The Company has determined that the swaps have payment, expiration dates, and provisions that coincide with the terms of the Notes and are therefore considered to be effective cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the Company records the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. Total unrealized gain recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, related to these cash flow hedges was million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The total fair value of the swap assets as of September 30, 2024 was million and is recorded as a component of Other Non-Current assets within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. There was no material ineffectiveness for the period presented. The Company does not expect to enter into any transactions during the next twelve months which would result in reclassification into earnings or losses associated with these swaps currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

 million paid by the Company's insurance carrier. On November 17, 2023, the court entered a Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal with Prejudice approving the settlement. After the putative shareholder class action lawsuit was filed, three related putative shareholder derivative actions were also filed. These cases generally allege breaches of fiduciary duties premised on alleged materially false and misleading statements and/or omissions related to pending litigation, as alleged in the shareholder class action. First, on July 1, 2021, a putative shareholder derivative complaint was filed by Anning Fang, a purported stockholder, in Palm Beach County, Florida Circuit Court against the Company, as well as current and former Company directors and officers George C. Zoley, Jose Gordo, Brian R. Evans, Ann M. Schlarb, Richard H. Glanton, Anne N. Foreman, Christopher C. Wheeler, Julie M. Wood, Guido van Hauwermeiren, Scott M. Kernan, and Duane Helkowski (collectively, the State-Court Defendants ). Second, on November 12, 2021, a putative shareholder derivative complaint was filed by Rui Zhang, a purported stockholder, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the Company, the State-Court Defendants, as well as then current and former Company officers David Venturella and J. David Donahue (collectively, the Derivative Defendants ). Third, on August 24, 2022, a putative stockholder derivative complaint was filed by Gerardo Maldonado Jr., a purported stockholder, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the Company and the Derivative Defendants. The state-court Fang complaint alleges breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims against the State-Court Defendants relating to purported healthcare and quality of care deficiencies, an allegedly inadequate response to the COVID-19 pandemic, alleged forced labor by detainees, and alleged exposure to pending litigation, which purportedly led to damage to GEO. The Zhang and Maldonado federal-court complaints make similar allegations of breach of fiduciary duty as to the Derivative Defendants, assert claims for unjust enrichment and waste of corporate assets, and also allege that the Derivative Defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and that Mr. Zoley contributed to alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act. Following mediation, the Zhang parties reached an agreement to resolve all derivative claims with the Company agreeing to adopt certain corporate governance policies. On September 6, 2024, the Zhang court entered an Order Approving Final Settlement and Final Judgment. The approval of the settlement by the Zhang court released all of the claims asserted in the Fang and Maldonado complaints as well. Thus, the Fang parties and the Maldonado parties have all agreed to dismissals with prejudice of those respective derivative actions. By this filing, the Company hereby provides notice of the respective parties intent for those derivative actions to be dismissed with prejudice. Immigration Detainee Litigation Civil immigration detainees at the Aurora ICE Processing Center filed a class action lawsuit on October 22, 2014, against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The complaint alleges that the Company was in violation of the Colorado Minimum Wage Act ("CMWA") and the Federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act TVPA ). The complaint also claims that the Company was unjustly enriched based on the level of payment the detainees received for work performed in a Voluntary Work Program ("VWP") the Company is required to implement at the facility under the terms of its contract with the federal government. On July 6, 2015, the court found that detainees were not employees under the CMWA and dismissed this claim. On February 27, 2017, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification on the TVPA and unjust enrichment claims. The plaintiffs' class seeks actual damages, compensatory damages, exemplary damages, punitive damages, restitution, attorneys fees and costs, and such other relief as the court may deem proper. On October 18, 2022, the court issued an order granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on the Company s affirmative defenses, denying the Company s motion for summary judgment, motion to dismiss, and motion for decertification of the class, narrowing the class period for plaintiffs TVPA claims, and otherwise ruling against the Company s motions for relief. All trial dates are currently stayed by court order pending appeal of certain of GEO's defenses to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeal. Oral argument before the Tenth Circuit was held on September 18, 2023. On October 22, 2024, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an Order finding appellate review of GEO s claim of immunity was premature 

 25 

million judgment entered against the Company in the retrial of the two cases, which judgment amounts were subsequently increased by a further award against the Company of attorney s fees, costs, and pre-judgment interest in the amount of million. Post-judgment interest is accruing on these judgments in accordance with Washington law. The trial court has waived the necessity to post a supersedeas bond for the combined judgments and has stayed enforcement of the verdict and judgments while GEO s appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is pending. Oral argument before the Ninth Circuit was held on October 6, 2022. On March 7, 2023, the Ninth Circuit certified certain state law questions to the Washington Supreme Court. Oral argument before the Washington Supreme Court was held on October 17, 2023. On December 21, 2023, the Washington Supreme Court issued an opinion answering the questions certified by the Ninth Circuit. Under the Ninth Circuit s March 7, 2023 order certifying the above questions to the Washington Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit has resumed control and jurisdiction over the State of Washington lawsuits. On February 21, 2024, the United States Department of Justice filed its Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae in Support of GEO, arguing that the State of Washington judgments should be reversed because the Supremacy Clause precludes application of the Washington Minimum Wage Statute to work programs for federal detainees. In its Brief, the Department of Justice asserts that application of the Washington law independently contravenes intergovernmental immunity because it would make federal detainees subject to provisions that do not apply, and never have applied, to persons in state custody, singling out a contractor with the federal government for obligations Washington does not itself bear. The Department of Justice also contends that the immigration statutory structure approved by Congress does not contemplate a role for states or state law in governing the VWP for federal detainees. In California, a class action lawsuit was filed on December 19, 2017, by immigration detainees against the Company in the U.S. District Court, Eastern Division of the Central District of California. The California lawsuit alleges violations of the state s minimum wage laws, violations of the TVPA and California's equivalent state statute, unjust enrichment, unfair competition and retaliation. The California court has certified a class of individuals who have been civilly detained at the Company's Adelanto Facility from December 19, 2014, until the date of final judgment. On March 31, 2022, the court entered a stay until the Ninth Circuit rules on the State of Washington lawsuits. Current and former detainees of the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center and the Golden State Annex ICE Processing Center filed a class action lawsuit on July 13, 2022, against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, Fresno Division. This lawsuit is similar to the cases in Colorado, the State of Washington, and California discussed above. The complaint alleges that federal detainees who volunteer to participate in the VWP at GEO s Mesa Verde and Golden State Annex ICE facilities are employees of GEO and entitled to the state s minimum wage. Plaintiffs also make claims for unfair competition, unjust enrichment, human trafficking, forced labor, California's Private Attorneys General Act and retaliation. GEO filed both a motion to stay the action pending the Ninth Circuit's decision in the State of Washington lawsuits and a motion to dismiss the action in its entirety. On July 10, 2023, the court entered a stay until the Ninth Circuit rules on the State of Washington lawsuits. GEO believes it operates the VWP in full compliance with its contract with ICE and all applicable laws, regulations, and standards. GEO strongly disputes the claims made in these lawsuits, and intends to take all necessary steps to vigorously defend itself from these lawsuits. GEO has not recorded any accruals relating to these lawsuits at this time as losses are not considered probable. Challenges to State Legislation that Conflict with Federal Contracts On July 13, 2023, the Company filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against the State of Washington for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the State of Washington s newly enacted law House Bill 1470. House Bill 1470 purports to empower state agencies with new rule making, inspection, investigation, and testing powers over the Northwest ICE Processing Center. House Bill 1470 also creates a statutory regime of civil penalties applicable to private detention facilities for violations of House Bill 1470 detention standards, and purports to create a private right of action for detainees aggrieved by violations of the statute. On March 8, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered an order preliminarily

million towards the estimated liability related to the assessment for the audited period. Following the submission of an application in September 2024, the Company was accepted to participate in the State's managed audit program and entered into a Managed Audit Agreement (the "Agreement") with the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department for the post-audit period. The Agreement provides for a waiver of penalties and interest and as such, the Company recorded a favorable adjustment for penalties and interest related to the post-audit period of approximately million in the third quarter of 2024. Accruals for Legal Proceedings The Company establishes accruals for specific legal proceedings when it is considered probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. However, the results of these claims or proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these claims or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including the modification or loss of one or more facility management contracts, or could result in a material impairment of the Company s assets. The Company's accruals for loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as additional information becomes available. The Company generally does not accrue for anticipated legal fees and costs but expenses those items as incurred.

million of which million was spent through the first nine months of 2024. The Company estimates the remaining capital requirements related to these capital projects will be million which will be spent through the remainder of 2024. Inventories Inventory, which consists primarily of component parts related to electronic monitoring equipment, is measured at average cost and carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value and is approximately million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Inventory is included in Other Non-Current Assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Uncertain Tax Positions A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the position. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a total of approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. Approximately million of this total was generated in the second quarter of 2024, and relates to interest deduction for GEO shares issued to the holders of our Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026. There was not a significant increase during the third quarter of 2024. Approximately all of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate. The Company does not believe it has any existing tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that it will be required to record significant amounts of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Idle Facilities As of September 30, 2024, the Company was marketing (or awaiting activation) ten idle facilities to potential customers. One of the facilities, Cheyenne Mountain Recovery Center, is under a contract which has yet to be activated. The carrying values of these idle facilities are included in Property and Equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

 Forward-Looking Information 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are any statements that are not based on historical information. Statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, legal proceedings and potential steps to address our future debt maturities are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate or continue or the negative of such words or variations of such words and similar expressions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements and we can give no assurance that such forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, or cautionary statements, include, but are not limited to: 
 
 our ability to timely build and/or open facilities as planned, successfully manage such facilities and successfully integrate such facilities into our operations without substantial additional costs; 

our ability to estimate the government s level of utilization of public-private partnerships for secure services and the impact of any modifications or reductions by our government customers of their utilization of public-private partnerships; 

our ability to accurately project the size and growth of public-private partnerships for secure services in the U.S. and internationally and our ability to capitalize on opportunities for public-private partnerships; 

our ability to successfully respond to any challenges or concerns that our government customers may raise regarding their use of public-private partnerships for secure services, including finding other government customers or alternative uses for facilities where a government customer has discontinued or announced that a contract with us will be discontinued; 

the impact of adopted or proposed executive action or legislation under the existing or a new administration aimed at limiting public-private partnerships for secure facilities, processing centers and community reentry centers or limiting or restricting the business and operations of financial institutions or others who do business with us; 

our ability to successfully respond to delays encountered by states pursuing public-private partnerships for secure services and cost savings initiatives implemented by a number of states; 

our ability to activate the inactive beds at our idle facilities; 

our ability to maintain or increase occupancy rates at our facilities and the impact of fluctuations in occupancy levels on our revenues and profitability; 

the impact of our termination of our REIT election and the discontinuation of quarterly dividend payments and our ability to maximize the use of cash flows to repay debt, deleverage and internally fund growth; 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of terminating our REIT election or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected, if at all, or may not offset the costs of terminating our REIT election and becoming a taxable C Corporation; 

if we failed to remain qualified as a REIT for those years we elected REIT status, we would be subject to additional corporate income taxes and would not be able to deduct distributions to shareholders when computing our taxable income for those years; 

our ability to expand, diversify and grow our secure services, reentry, community-based services, monitoring services, evidence-based supervision and treatment programs and secure transportation services businesses; 

our ability to win management contracts for which we have submitted proposals, retain existing management contracts, prevail in any challenge or protest involving the award of a management contract and meet any performance standards required by such management contracts; 

33 

our ability to raise new project development capital given the often short-term nature of the customers commitment to use newly developed facilities; 

our ability to develop long-term earnings visibility; 

our ability to successfully conduct our operations in the United Kingdom and South Africa through joint ventures; 

the instability of foreign exchange rates, exposing us to currency risks in Australia, the United Kingdom, and South Africa, or other countries in which we may choose to conduct our business; 

an increase in unreimbursed labor rates; 

our exposure to rising medical costs; 

our ability to manage costs and expenses relating to ongoing litigation arising from our operations; 

our ability to successfully pursue an appeal to reverse the unfavorable verdict and judgments in the retrial of the lawsuits in the State of Washington, our company being required to record an accrual for the judgments in the future, and our ability to defend similar other pending litigation and the effect such litigation may have on our company; 

our ability to accurately estimate on an annual basis, loss reserves related to general liability, workers compensation and automobile liability claims; 

our ability to fulfill our debt service obligations and its impact on our liquidity; 

our ability to deleverage and repay, refinance or otherwise address our debt maturities in an amount or on the timeline we expect, or at all; 

despite current indebtedness levels, we may still incur more indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks relating to our indebtedness; 

the covenants in the indentures governing the Convertible Notes, the Secured Notes and the Unsecured Notes and the Credit Agreement impose significant operating and financial restrictions which may adversely affect our ability to operate our business; 

servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and we may not be able to generate the cash required to service our indebtedness; 

because portions of our senior indebtedness have floating interest rates, an increase in interest rates would adversely affect cash flows; 

we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries to make payments on our indebtedness and these distributions may not be made; 

we may not be able to satisfy our repurchase obligations in the event of a change of control because the terms of our indebtedness or lack of funds may prevent us from doing so; 

our ability to identify and successfully complete any potential sales of Company-owned assets and businesses or potential acquisitions of assets or businesses on commercially advantageous terms on a timely basis, or at all; 

from time to time, we may not have a management contract with a client to operate existing beds at a facility or new beds at a facility that we are expanding, and we cannot assure you that such a contract will be obtained. Failure to obtain a management contract for these beds will subject us to carrying costs with no corresponding management revenue; 

negative conditions in the capital markets could prevent us from obtaining future financing on desirable terms, which could materially harm our business; 

we are subject to the loss of our facility management contracts, due to executive orders, terminations, non-renewals or competitive re-bids or legal proceedings, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity, including our ability to secure new facility management contracts from other government customers; 

our growth depends on our ability to secure contracts to develop and manage new secure facilities, processing centers and community-based facilities and to secure contracts to provide electronic monitoring services, community-based reentry services and monitoring and supervision services, the demand for which is outside our control; 

we may not be able to meet state requirements for capital investment or locate land for the development of new facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth; 

34 

we partner with a limited number of governmental customers who account for a significant portion of our revenues. The loss of, or a significant decrease in revenues from, these customers could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations; 

State budgetary constraints may have a material adverse impact on us; 

competition for contracts may adversely affect the profitability of our business; 

we are dependent on government appropriations, which may not be made on a timely basis or at all and may be adversely impacted by budgetary constraints at the federal, state, local and foreign government levels; 

public and political resistance to the use of public-private partnerships for secure facilities, electronic monitoring and supervision as alternatives to detention, processing centers and community reentry centers could result in our inability to obtain new contracts or the loss of existing contracts, impact our ability to obtain or refinance debt financing or enter into commercial arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our securities; 

adverse publicity may negatively impact our ability to retain existing contracts and obtain new contracts; 

we may incur significant start-up and operating costs on new contracts before receiving related revenues, which may impact our cash flows and may not be recouped; 

failure to comply with extensive government regulation and applicable contractual requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations; 

we may face community opposition to facility locations, which may adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts; 

our business operations expose us to various liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance, including legal claims and proceedings, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations; 

we may not be able to obtain or maintain the insurance levels required by our government contracts; 

our exposure to rising general insurance costs; 

natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks, global political events and other serious catastrophic events could disrupt operations and otherwise materially adversely affect our business and financial condition; 

our international operations expose us to risks that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations; 

we conduct certain of our operations through joint ventures or consortiums, which may lead to disagreements with our joint venture partners or business partners and adversely affect our interest in the joint ventures or consortiums; 

we are dependent upon our senior management and our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel; 

our profitability may be materially adversely affected by inflation; 

various risks associated with the ownership of real estate may increase costs, expose us to uninsured losses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations; 

risks related to facility construction and development activities may increase our costs related to such activities; 

the rising cost and increasing difficulty of obtaining adequate levels of surety credit on favorable terms could adversely affect our operating results; 

adverse developments in our relationship with our employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations; 

technological changes could cause our electronic monitoring products and technology, including our recently launched BI VeriWatch wrist-worn device, to become obsolete or require the redesign of our electronic monitoring products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business; 

any negative changes in the level of acceptance of or resistance to the use of electronic monitoring products, including our recently launched BI VeriWatch wrist-worn device, and services by governmental customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; 

we depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply quality infrastructure components for our electronic monitoring products. If our suppliers cannot provide the components or services we require in a timely manner 

35 

and/or with such quality as we expect, our ability to market and sell our electronic monitoring products and services could be harmed; 

the interruption, delay or failure of the provision of our services or information systems could adversely affect our business; 

an inability to acquire, protect or maintain our intellectual property and patents in the electronic monitoring space could harm our ability to compete or grow; 

our electronic monitoring products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which may lead to litigation that could itself be costly, could result in the payment of substantial damages or royalties, and/or prevent us from using technology that is essential to our products; 

we license intellectual property rights in the electronic monitoring space, including patents, from third party owners. If such owners do not properly maintain or enforce the intellectual property underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects could be harmed. Our licensors may also seek to terminate our license; 

we may be subject to costly product liability claims from the use of our electronic monitoring products, which could damage our reputation, impair the marketability of our products and services and force us to pay costs and damages that may not be covered by adequate insurance; 

any continuing impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on GEO and GEO's ability to mitigate the risks associated with COVID-19; 

as a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded and will continue to record a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. In the future, our goodwill or other intangible assets may become impaired, which could result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations; 

we are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility; 

the market price of our common stock may vary substantially; 

future sales of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may be dilutive to current shareholders; 

various anti-takeover protections applicable to us may make an acquisition of us more difficult and reduce the market value of our common stock; 

failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have an adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our common stock; 

we may issue additional debt securities that could limit our operating flexibility and negatively affect the value of our common stock; 

failure to comply with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences; and 

other factors contained in our filings with the SEC, including, but not limited to, those detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. 

We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Introduction 
 
 The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, those described above under Forward-Looking Information , and under Part I - Item 1A.

We specialize in the ownership, leasing and management of secure facilities, processing centers and reentry facilities and the provision of community-based services in the United States, Australia and South Africa. We own, lease and operate a broad range of secure facilities including maximum, medium and minimum-security facilities, processing centers, as well as community-based reentry facilities. We develop new facilities based on contract awards, using our project development expertise and experience to design, construct and finance what we believe are state-of-the-art facilities. We provide innovative technologies, industry-leading monitoring services, and evidence-based supervision and treatment programs for community based programs. We also provide secure transportation services domestically and in the United Kingdom through our joint venture GEOAmey. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our worldwide operations include the management and/or ownership of approximately 80,000 beds at 99 secure services and community based facilities, including idle facilities, and also include the provision of community supervision services for individuals through an array of technology products including radio frequency, GPS, and alcohol monitoring devices. 
 
 We provide a diversified scope of services on behalf of our government agency partners: 
 our secure facility management services involve the provision of security, administrative, rehabilitation, education, and food services at secure services facilities; 

our reentry services involve supervision of individuals in community-based programs and re-entry centers and the provision of temporary housing, programming, employment assistance and other services with the intention of the successful reintegration of residents into the community; 

we provide comprehensive electronic monitoring and supervision services; 

we develop new facilities, using our project development experience to design, construct and finance what we believe are state-of-the-art facilities; 

we provide secure transportation services; and 

our services are provided at facilities which we either own, lease or are owned by the government. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had consolidated revenues of 1,816.0 million and 1,804.9 million, respectively. We maintained an average company-wide facility occupancy rate of approximately 88 including 68,004 active beds and excluding 11,275 idle beds, which includes those being marketed to potential customers, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and approximately 86 including 71,034 active beds and excluding 10,221 idle beds, which includes those being marketed to potential customers, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Reference is made to Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, for further discussion and analysis of information pertaining to our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Contract Developments 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, ICE issued a task order for our company-owned 1,940-bed Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California which provides for continued funding through October 19, 2024, allowing additional time for ICE to obtain relief from previously disclosed COVID-related litigation that currently prevents full use of the Adelanto Center. On October 4, 2024, we announced that ICE has exercised a five-year option period extending the contract for our Adelanto Center through December 19, 2029. 
 
 Additionally, our 700-bed Broward Transitional Center; 1,314-bed Montgomery Processing Center; and 1,904-bed South Texas ICE Processing Center were renewed for one-year terms through August of 2025, and our Karnes County ICE Processing Center was renewed for a five-year term through August of 2029. Our 1,532-bed Aurora ICE Processing Center was also renewed for a one-year term through October of 2025. 
 
 On July 31, 2024 we successfully completed the previously disclosed transition of operations at the state-owned 1,536-bed Lawrenceville Correctional Center in Virginia, which is now managed by the Virginia Department of Corrections. 
 
 Business Segments 
 
 We conduct our business through four reportable business segments: our U.S. Secure Services segment; our Electronic Monitoring and Supervision Services segment; our Reentry Services segment and our International Services segment. We have identified these 
 37 

four reportable segments to reflect our current view that we operate four distinct business lines, each of which constitutes a material part of our overall business. 
 
 Our U.S. Secure Services segment primarily encompasses our U.S.-based public-private partnership secure services business. Our Electronic Monitoring and Supervision Services segment, which conducts its services in the U.S., consists of our electronic monitoring and supervision services. Our Reentry Services segment consists of various community-based and reentry services. Our International Services segment primarily consists of our public-private partnership secure services operations in Australia and South Africa. 
 
 Idle Facilities 
 We are currently marketing (or awaiting activation) 11,275 vacant beds at nine of our ten idle facilities to potential customers, with the exception of our company-owned 750-bed Cheyenne Mountain Recovery Center, which is under a contract that has not yet been activated. The carrying values of these idle facilities totaled 282.8 million as of September 30, 2024, excluding equipment and other assets that can be easily transferred for use at other facilities. Refer to Note 11 - Commitments, Contingencies and Other Matters of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We routinely evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not experience any significant changes in estimates or judgments inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

U.S. Secure Services 
 Revenues for U.S. Secure Services increased by 15.9 million in the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 (the "Third Quarter 2024") compared to the third quarter ended September 30, 2023 (the "Third Quarter 2023") due to aggregate net increases of 20.8 million primarily due to increases in occupancies, rates and/or per diem amounts in connection with contract modifications. Partially offsetting this increase were decreases of approximately 4.9 million related to the transition of operations at the state-owned 1,536-bed Lawrenceville Correctional Center in Virginia to the Virginia Department of Corrections. 
 The number of compensated mandays in U.S. Secure Services facilities was relatively consistent at approximately 4.2 million in Third Quarter 2024 and Third Quarter 2023. We look at the average occupancy in our facilities to determine how we are managing our available beds. The average occupancy is calculated by taking compensated mandays as a percentage of capacity. The average occupancy in our U.S. Secure Services facilities was 87.2 and 86.6 of capacity in the Third Quarter 2024 and Third Quarter 2023, respectively, excluding idle facilities.

 International Services 
 Revenues for International Services was relatively consistent in Third Quarter 2024 compared to Third Quarter 2023. We experienced a net increase of 1.4 million primarily due to increased populations at our Australian subsidiary and our new health care contract in Australia.

We also experienced a decrease of approximately 4.7 million related to the transition of operations at the state-owned 1,536-bed Lawrenceville Correctional Center in Virginia to the Virginia Department of Corrections. Partially offsetting these decreases were aggregate net increases in connection with labor and medical costs, transportation services, increased occupancies and the variable costs associated with those services of 9.4 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment revenue have decreased due to favorable operating margins on our new transportation contracts. 
 
 Electronic Monitoring and Supervision Services

The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate both increased in Third Quarter 2024 compared to the Third Quarter 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the lower pre-tax income level for the Nine Months 2024 compared to 2023, while the higher provision is due to the higher effective tax rate and increased pre-tax income in Third Quarter 2024 compared to Third Quarter 2023. In Third Quarter 2024 and Third Quarter 2023, there was a 0.3 million and 2.1 million net discrete tax benefit, respectively. In Third Quarter 2024 and Third Quarter 2023 there was no discrete tax expense or benefit related to stock compensation that vested during the respective quarters. We estimate our 2024 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of approximately 31 to 33 , exclusive of any discrete items.

General and administrative expenses increased by 13.2 million in Nine Months 2024 compared to Nine Months 2023 primarily due to increases in certain transaction fees related to our private exchange transactions involving our convertible notes of 3.5 million, certain compensation adjustment decreases during Nine Months 2023 of 4.1 million, with the remaining increase due to increases in business development, consulting and other administrative expenses.

Interest income increased by 3.8 million in Nine Months 2024 compared to Nine Months 2023 primarily due to higher cash balances on hand domestically and internationally. 
 Interest expense decreased by 17.6 million in Nine Months 2024 compared to Nine Months 2023 primarily due to our Senior Notes Offering and new Term Loan under our new credit agreement that closed on April 18, 2024 which resulted in overall lower interest rates. We also retired the majority of our 6.50 Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 during Nine Months 2024.

During Nine Months 2024, we completed a Senior Note Offering and also made mandatory prepayments on our Term Loan which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately 85.3 million which consisted of the write-off of existing deferred financing costs and net discount/premiums and the payment of call premiums. Refer to Note 10 - Debt of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion. 
 During Nine Months 2023, we made a mandatory quarterly prepayment on our Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 loans under our prior senior credit facility. In connection with the prepayment, we wrote off a proportionate amount of related deferred loan costs and discount/premium.

The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate decreased in the Nine Months 2024 compared to Nine Months 2023. The decrease in the provision for income taxes is primarily due to the lower pre-tax income level for Nine Months 2024 compared to Nine Months 2023. In Nine Months 2024 and Nine Months 2023, there was a 5.4 million and 2.0 million net discrete tax benefit, respectively. Included in the net discrete tax benefit from income taxes in Nine Months 2024 and Nine Months 2023 was a 1.0 million discrete tax benefit and a 0.9 million discrete tax expense related to stock compensation that vested during the respective periods. Also included in the net discrete tax benefit from income taxes in the Nine Months 2024 was a 3.5 million discrete tax benefit from the interest deduction related to GEO shares issued to the holders of our 6.5 Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 that participated in private exchange transactions. We estimate our 2024 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of approximately 31 to 33 , exclusive of any discrete items.

 Financial Condition 
 
 Capital Requirements 
 
 Our current cash requirements consist of amounts needed for working capital, debt service, supply purchases, research and development costs related to new electronic monitoring products, investments in joint ventures, and capital expenditures related to either the development of new secure, processing and reentry facilities, or the maintenance of existing facilities. In addition, some of our management contracts require us to make substantial initial expenditures of cash in connection with opening or renovating a facility. Generally, these initial expenditures are subsequently fully or partially recoverable as pass-through costs or are billable as a component of the per diem rates or monthly fixed fees to the contracting agency over the original term of the contract. Additional capital needs may also arise in the future with respect to possible acquisitions, other corporate transactions or other corporate purposes. 
 We currently have contractual commitments for a number of projects using Company financing. We estimate that the cost of these existing active capital projects will be approximately 67.2 million of which 45.3 million was spent through September 30, 2024. We estimate that the remaining capital requirements related to these capital projects will be 21.9 million which will be spent through the remainder of 2024. 
 
 We plan to fund all of our capital needs, including capital expenditures, from cash on hand, cash from operations, borrowings under our Credit Agreement (as defined below) and any other financings which our management and Board, in their discretion, may consummate. Currently, our primary source of liquidity to meet these requirements is cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Credit Agreement. Our management believes that our financial resources and sources of liquidity will allow us to manage our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We completed our annual budgeting process, and for 2024, we will continue to strategically manage our capital expenditures to maintain both short and long term financial objectives. Additionally, we may from time to time pursue transactions for the potential sale or acquisition of assets and businesses and/or other strategic transactions. Our management believes that cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our Credit Agreement will be adequate to support our capital requirements for 2024 as disclosed under Capital Requirements above and the next twelve months. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Indebtedness 
 
 Senior Notes Offering and Credit Agreement 
 
 On April 18, 2024, we announced the closing of our previously announced private offering of 1.275 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, comprised of 650.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625 senior secured notes due 2029 and 625.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.250 senior notes due 2031. 
 
 45 

We also entered into a credit agreement, dated April 18, 2024 (the "Credit Agreement") to, among other things, evidence and govern a first-lien senior secured revolving credit facility and the commitments thereunder, and a first-lien senior secured term loan facility. The aggregate principal amount of revolving credit commitments under the senior revolving credit facility is 310 million (including a 175 million letter of credit subfacility) and the aggregate principal amount of the senior secured term loan facility is 450.0 million. 
 
 We used the net proceeds of the senior notes offering, borrowings under the new term loan, and cash on hand to refinance approximately 1.5 billion of existing indebtedness, including to fund the repurchase, redemption or other discharge of our existing Tranche 1 Term Loan and Tranche 2 Term Loan under our prior senior credit facility, the 9.50 senior second lien secured notes due 2028, the 10.50 senior second lien secured notes due 2028, and the 6.00 senior notes due 2026, to pay related premiums, transaction fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes of the Company. 
 
 With these transactions, as well as the private exchange transactions involving our 6.50 Exchangeable Notes due 2026 discussed below, we have been able to push out substantially all of our debt maturities out to 2029 and 2031. 
 
 Refer to Note 10 - Debt of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 6.50 Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 
 
 On February 24, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, GEOCH, completed a private offering of 230 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50 Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026, which included the full exercise of the initial purchasers over-allotment option to purchase an additional 30 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes will mature on February 23, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or exchanged. The Convertible Notes bear interest at the rate of 6.50 per year plus an additional amount based on the dividends paid by GEO on its common stock. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2021. 
 
 Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The initial conversion rate is 108.4011 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 9.225 per share of common stock). The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events. If GEO or GEOCH undergoes a fundamental change, holders may require GEOCH to purchase the Convertible Notes in whole or in part for cash at a fundamental change purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. 
 During the second and third quarters of 2024, the Company exchanged approximately 229.7 million of aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 6.50 Exchangeable Senior Notes in private exchange transactions for an exchange value of approximately 410 million. The consideration consisted of cash and shares of GEO common stock. Refer to Note 10 - Debt of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 Our debt outstanding under the Credit Agreement, the Secured Notes, the Unsecured Notes and the 6.50 Exchangeable Senior Notes require cash expenditures for debt service. Our significant debt obligations could have material consequences. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our High Level of Indebtedness in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We are exposed to various commitments and contingencies which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. We also have guaranteed certain obligations for certain of our international subsidiaries. These commitments, contingencies and guarantees are further discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Refer to Note 10 - Debt of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on our indebtedness. 
 
 We consider opportunities for future business and/or asset acquisitions or dispositions as we deem appropriate when market conditions present opportunities. If we are successful in our pursuit of any new projects, our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowings under the new Credit Agreement may not provide sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs and we could be forced to seek additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that any such financing or refinancing would be available to us on terms equal to or more favorable than our current financing terms, or at all. In the future, our access to capital and ability to compete for future capital-intensive projects will also be dependent upon, among other things, our ability to meet certain financial covenants in the indenture governing the Secured Notes, the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes, the indenture governing our Convertible Notes and our Credit Agreement. A substantial decline in our financial performance could limit our access to capital pursuant to these covenants and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources and, as a result, on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to these foregoing potential constraints on our capital, a number of state government agencies have been suffering from budget deficits and liquidity issues. While we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024 and we expect to continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants, if these constraints were 
 46 

to intensify, our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted as could our ability to remain in compliance with these debt covenants. 
 
 Guarantor Financial Information

Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to 223.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus net cash provided by operating activities of 230.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was positively impacted by non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, loss on asset divestitures/impairment, loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of debt issuance costs, discount and/or premium and other non-cash interest, dividends received from unconsolidated joint ventures and stock-based compensation expense. Equity in earnings of affiliates, net of tax and realized/unrealized gain on investments negatively impacted cash. Accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets decreased in total by 7.3 million, representing a positive impact on cash. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of billings and collections. Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities increased by 3.6 million which positively impacted cash. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of payments. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was positively impacted by net income attributable to GEO, non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of debt issuance costs, discount and/or premium and other non-cash interest, dividends received from unconsolidated joint ventures and stock-based compensation expense. Equity in earnings of affiliates, net of tax, gain on assets held for sale and realized/unrealized gain on investments negatively impacted cash. Accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets decreased in total by 45.1 million, representing a positive impact on cash. The decrease was primarily driven by the favorable timing of billings and collections. Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased by 9.7 million which negatively impacted cash. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of payments. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 80.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of capital expenditures of 57.9 million, proceeds from sale of marketable securities of 9.4 million and purchases of marketable securities of 31.7 million. Net cash used in investing activities of 35.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of capital expenditures of 53.6 million, proceeds from sale of real estate and other assets of 15.1 million and proceeds from sale of property and equipment of 2.7 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 186.1 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 128.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of proceeds from long-term debt of 1,720.5 million, proceeds from borrowings on revolver of 40.0 million, payments on long-term debt of 1,873.9 million, payments for call premiums of 35.6 million, debt issuance costs of 30.6 million and taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of 7.5 million. Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of payments on long-term debt of 131.4 million, taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of 3.4 million partially offset by proceeds from sale of treasury shares of 5.8 million. 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted by adding provision for (benefit from) income tax, interest expense, net of interest income and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for (gain) loss on asset divestitures/impairment, pre-tax, net loss attributable to non-controlling interests, stock-based compensation expenses, pre-tax, start-up expenses, pre-tax, transaction fees, pre-tax, close-out expenses, pre-tax, ATM equity program expenses, pre-tax and other non-cash revenues and expenses, pre-tax, and certain other adjustments as defined from time to time. 
 
 Given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are helpful to investors as measures of our operational performance because they provide an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to satisfy general operating expenses, to make capital expenditures, and to fund other cash needs or reinvest cash into our business. 
 
 We believe that by removing the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) and excluding certain non-cash charges, amounts spent on interest and taxes, and certain other charges that are highly variable from year to year, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide our investors with performance measures that reflect the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, per diem rates and operating costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income. 
 
 The adjustments we make to derive the non-GAAP measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items which may cause short-term fluctuations in income from continuing operations and which we do not consider to be the fundamental attributes or primary drivers of our business plan and they do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. 
 
 48 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide disclosure on the same basis as that used by our management and provide consistency in our financial reporting, facilitate internal and external comparisons of our historical operating performance and our business units and provide continuity to investors for comparability purposes.

Outlook 
 
 The following discussion contains statements that are not limited to historical statements and, therefore, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors and the "Forward Looking Statements - Safe Harbor" sections in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion on forward-looking statements and the risks and other factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals and cause the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements and the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward-looking statements. 
 
 We continue to be encouraged by the current landscape of growth opportunities; however, any positive trends may, to some extent, be adversely impacted by government budgetary constraints or any changes to a government's willingness to maintain or grow public-private partnerships in the future. While state finances overall are stable, future budgetary pressures may cause state agencies to pursue a number of cost savings initiatives which may include reductions in per diem rates and/or the scope of services provided by private operators or the decision to not re-bid a contract after expiration of the contract term. These potential cost savings initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our current operations and/or our ability to pursue new business opportunities. Additionally, if state budgetary constraints, as discussed above, develop, persist or intensify, our state customers ability to pay us may be impaired and/or we may be forced to renegotiate our management contracts on less favorable terms and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. We plan to actively bid on any new projects that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk. Any positive trends in the industry may be offset by several factors, including budgetary constraints, contract modifications, contract terminations, contract non-renewals, contract re-bids and/or the decision to not re-bid a contract after expiration of the contract term and the impact of any other potential changes to the willingness or ability to maintain or grow public-private partnerships on the part of other government agencies. We believe we have a strong relationship with our government agency partners and we believe that we operate facilities that maximize security, safety and efficiency while offering our suite of GEO Continuum of Care programs, services and resources. In our Secure Services segment, we have over 18,000 available beds across contracted and idle facilities to support any future federal government capacity needs. 
 
 Internationally, we are exploring opportunities in our current markets and will continue to actively bid on any opportunities that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk. 
 
 With respect to our reentry services, electronic monitoring services, and community-based services business, we are currently pursuing a number of business development opportunities. Related to opportunities for community-based reentry services, we are working with our existing federal, state, and local clients to leverage new opportunities for both residential reentry facilities as well as non-residential day reporting centers. With respect to the Department of Homeland Security's ISAP, since 2023 and into 2024, there has been a decline in ISAP participants as a result of recent changes in immigration and budgetary pressures. However, in the fourth quarter of 2024, the daily ISAP participant counts have been increasing. We are focused on delivering high quality services and developing new and innovative technology solutions. To this end, we launched VeriWatch, a new wrist-worn GPS tracking device that allows for real-time and discrete monitoring of individuals under community supervision. We continue to expend resources on informing federal, state and local governments about the benefits of public-private partnerships, and we anticipate that there will be new opportunities in the future as those efforts continue to yield results. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on any suitable opportunities that become available in this area. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our contracts to provide services to our governmental clients. Labor and related costs represented approximately 69 and 66 of our operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additional significant operating expenses include food, utilities and medical costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, operating expenses totaled approximately 73 and 72 , respectively, of our consolidated revenues. We expect our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in 2024 will be impacted by the opening of any new or existing idle facilities as a result of the cost of transitioning and/or start-up operations related to a facility opening. We also expect that our operating expenses will be impacted by the effect of inflation on costs related to personnel, utilities, insurance, and medical and food, among other operational costs. During 2024, we will incur carrying costs for facilities that are currently vacant. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits, professional fees and other administrative expenses. During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses totaled approximately 8 , of our consolidated revenues. We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in 2024 to remain consistent or decrease as a result of cost savings initiatives. 
 50 

Idle Facilities 
 We are currently marketing (or awaiting activation) 11,275 vacant beds at seven U.S. Secure Services and at three of our Reentry Services idle facilities to potential customers. One of our U.S. Secure Services idle facilities, the 750-bed Cheyenne Mountain Recovery Center, is currently under a contract that has not yet been activated. The annual net carrying cost of our idle facilities in 2024 is estimated to be 28.5 million, including depreciation expense of 13.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, these ten facilities had a combined net book value of 282.8 million. We currently do not have any firm commitment or agreement in place to activate the idle facilities (except for the Cheyenne Mountain Recovery Center). Historically, some facilities have been idle for multiple years before they received a new contract award. These idle facilities are included in the U.S. Secure Services and Reentry Services segments. The per diem rates that we charge our clients often vary by contract across our portfolio. However, if the remaining idle facilities were to be activated using our U.S. Secure Services and Reentry Services average per diem rates in 2024 (calculated as the U.S. Secure Services and Reentry Services revenue divided by the number of U.S. Secure Services and Reentry Services mandays) and based on the average occupancy rate in our facilities through September 30, 2024, we would expect to receive incremental annualized revenue of approximately 357 million and an annualized increase in earnings per share of approximately 0.36 to 0.40 per share based on our average operating margins. 
 51 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates with respect to our Credit Agreement. Payments under the Credit Agreement are indexed to a variable interest rate. Based on borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement of approximately 413.8 million and approximately 63 million in outstanding letters of credit, as of September 30, 2024, for every one percent increase in the average interest rate applicable to the Credit Agreement, our total annual interest expense would have increased by approximately 4 million. 
 Additionally, we invest our cash in a variety of short-term financial instruments to provide a return. These instruments generally consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less. While these instruments are subject to interest rate risk, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We are also exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar, and the Australian dollar, the South African Rand and the British Pound currency exchange rates. Based upon our foreign currency exchange rate exposure as of September 30, 2024, every 10 percent change in historical currency rates would have approximately a 8.2 million effect on our financial position and approximately a 0.4 million impact on our results of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, referred to as the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. On the basis of this review, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC, under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 It should be noted that the effectiveness of our system of disclosure controls and procedures is subject to certain limitations inherent in any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing and evaluating the controls and procedures, the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood of future events, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will detect all errors or fraud. As a result, by its nature, our system of disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
 Our management is responsible to report any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management believes that there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

PART II - OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 Litigation, Claims and Assessments 
 
 Shareholder and Derivative Litigation 
 
 On July 7, 2020, a putative shareholder class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and its officers George C. Zoley and Brian R. Evans in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The parties resolved this matter following mediation for a payment to a settlement class of 3 million paid by the Company's insurance carrier. On November 17, 2023, the court entered a Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal with Prejudice approving the settlement. After the putative shareholder class action lawsuit was filed, three related putative shareholder derivative actions were also filed. These cases generally allege breaches of fiduciary duties premised on alleged materially false and misleading statements and/or omissions related to pending litigation, as alleged in the shareholder class action. First, on July 1, 2021, a putative shareholder derivative complaint was filed by Anning Fang, a purported stockholder, in Palm Beach County, Florida Circuit Court against the Company, as well as current and former Company directors and officers George C. Zoley, Jose Gordo, Brian R. Evans, Ann M. Schlarb, Richard H. Glanton, Anne N. Foreman, Christopher C. Wheeler, Julie M. Wood, Guido van Hauwermeiren, Scott M. Kernan, and Duane Helkowski (collectively, the State-Court Defendants ). Second, on November 12, 2021, a putative shareholder derivative complaint was filed by Rui Zhang, a purported stockholder, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the Company, the State-Court Defendants, as well as then current and former Company officers David Venturella and J. David Donahue (collectively, the Derivative Defendants ). Third, on August 24, 2022, a putative stockholder derivative complaint was filed by Gerardo Maldonado Jr., a purported stockholder, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the Company and the Derivative Defendants. 
 
 The state-court Fang complaint alleges breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims against the State-Court Defendants relating to purported healthcare and quality of care deficiencies, an allegedly inadequate response to the COVID-19 pandemic, alleged forced labor by detainees, and alleged exposure to pending litigation, which purportedly led to damage to GEO. The Zhang and Maldonado federal-court complaints make similar allegations of breach of fiduciary duty as to the Derivative Defendants, assert claims for unjust enrichment and waste of corporate assets, and also allege that the Derivative Defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and that Mr. Zoley contributed to alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act. 
 
 Following mediation, the Zhang parties reached an agreement to resolve all derivative claims with the Company agreeing to adopt certain corporate governance policies. On September 6, 2024, the Zhang court entered an Order Approving Final Settlement and Final Judgment. The approval of the settlement by the Zhang court released all of the claims asserted in the Fang and Maldonado complaints as well. Thus, the Fang parties and the Maldonado parties have all agreed to dismissals with prejudice of those respective derivative actions. By this filing, the Company hereby provides notice of the respective parties intent for those derivative actions to be dismissed with prejudice. 
 Immigration Detainee Litigation 
 
 Civil immigration detainees at the Aurora ICE Processing Center filed a class action lawsuit on October 22, 2014, against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The complaint alleges that the Company was in violation of the Colorado Minimum Wage Act ("CMWA") and the Federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act TVPA ). The complaint also claims that the Company was unjustly enriched based on the level of payment the detainees received for work performed in a Voluntary Work Program ("VWP") the Company is required to implement at the facility under the terms of its contract with the federal government. On July 6, 2015, the court found that detainees were not employees under the CMWA and dismissed this claim. On February 27, 2017, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification on the TVPA and unjust enrichment claims. The plaintiffs' class seeks actual damages, compensatory damages, exemplary damages, punitive damages, restitution, attorneys fees and costs, and such other relief as the court may deem proper. On October 18, 2022, the court issued an order granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on the Company s affirmative defenses, denying the Company s motion for summary judgment, motion to dismiss, and motion for decertification of the class, narrowing the class period for plaintiffs TVPA claims, and otherwise ruling against the Company s motions for relief. All trial dates are currently stayed by court order pending appeal of certain of GEO's defenses to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeal. Oral argument before the Tenth Circuit was held on September 18, 2023. On October 22, 2024, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an Order finding appellate review of GEO s claim of immunity was premature and, therefore, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals was currently without jurisdiction to consider the merits of GEO s claimed immunity. 

Since the Colorado suit was initially filed, four similar lawsuits have been filed - two in the State of Washington and two in California. 
 53 

The first of the two State of Washington lawsuits was filed on September 26, 2017, by immigration detainees against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The second lawsuit was filed on September 20, 2017, by the State Attorney General against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for Pierce County, which the Company removed to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on October 9, 2017. The plaintiffs claimed that State of Washington minimum wage laws should be enforced with respect to detainees who volunteer to participate in a VWP administered by GEO at the Northwest ICE Processing Center (the "Center") as required by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under the terms of GEO s contract. The Center houses persons in the custody of federal immigration authorities while the federal government is determining their immigration status. In October 2021, an unfavorable jury verdict and court judgment resulting in a combined 23.2 million judgment entered against the Company in the retrial of the two cases, which judgment amounts were subsequently increased by a further award against the Company of attorney s fees, costs, and pre-judgment interest in the amount of 14.4 million. Post-judgment interest is accruing on these judgments in accordance with Washington law. The trial court has waived the necessity to post a supersedeas bond for the combined judgments and has stayed enforcement of the verdict and judgments while GEO s appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is pending. Oral argument before the Ninth Circuit was held on October 6, 2022. On March 7, 2023, the Ninth Circuit certified certain state law questions to the Washington Supreme Court. Oral argument before the Washington Supreme Court was held on October 17, 2023. On December 21, 2023, the Washington Supreme Court issued an opinion answering the questions certified by the Ninth Circuit. Under the Ninth Circuit s March 7, 2023 order certifying the above questions to the Washington Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit has resumed control and jurisdiction over the State of Washington lawsuits. On February 21, 2024, the United States Department of Justice filed its Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae in Support of GEO, arguing that the State of Washington judgments should be reversed because the Supremacy Clause precludes application of the Washington Minimum Wage Statute to work programs for federal detainees. In its Brief, the Department of Justice asserts that application of the Washington law independently contravenes intergovernmental immunity because it would make federal detainees subject to provisions that do not apply, and never have applied, to persons in state custody, singling out a contractor with the federal government for obligations Washington does not itself bear. The Department of Justice also contends that the immigration statutory structure approved by Congress does not contemplate a role for states or state law in governing the VWP for federal detainees. 
 
 In California, a class action lawsuit was filed on December 19, 2017, by immigration detainees against the Company in the U.S. District Court, Eastern Division of the Central District of California. The California lawsuit alleges violations of the state s minimum wage laws, violations of the TVPA and California's equivalent state statute, unjust enrichment, unfair competition and retaliation. The California court has certified a class of individuals who have been civilly detained at the Company's Adelanto Facility from December 19, 2014, until the date of final judgment. On March 31, 2022, the court entered a stay until the Ninth Circuit rules on the State of Washington lawsuits. 
 
 Current and former detainees of the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center and the Golden State Annex ICE Processing Center filed a class action lawsuit on July 13, 2022, against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, Fresno Division. This lawsuit is similar to the cases in Colorado, the State of Washington, and California discussed above. The complaint alleges that federal detainees who volunteer to participate in the VWP at GEO s Mesa Verde and Golden State Annex ICE facilities are employees of GEO and entitled to the state s minimum wage. Plaintiffs also make claims for unfair competition, unjust enrichment, human trafficking, forced labor, California's Private Attorneys General Act and retaliation. GEO filed both a motion to stay the action pending the Ninth Circuit's decision in the State of Washington lawsuits and a motion to dismiss the action in its entirety. On July 10, 2023, the court entered a stay until the Ninth Circuit rules on the State of Washington lawsuits. 

GEO believes it operates the VWP in full compliance with its contract with ICE and all applicable laws, regulations, and standards. GEO strongly disputes the claims made in these lawsuits, and intends to take all necessary steps to vigorously defend itself from these lawsuits. GEO has not recorded any accruals relating to these lawsuits at this time as losses are not considered probable. 
 
 Challenges to State Legislation that Conflict with Federal Contracts 
 
 On July 13, 2023, the Company filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against the State of Washington for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the State of Washington s newly enacted law House Bill 1470. House Bill 1470 purports to empower state agencies with new rule making, inspection, investigation, and testing powers over the Northwest ICE Processing Center. House Bill 1470 also creates a statutory regime of civil penalties applicable to private detention facilities for violations of House Bill 1470 detention standards, and purports to create a private right of action for detainees aggrieved by violations of the statute. On March 8, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered an order preliminarily enjoining the enforcement of House Bill 1470 against GEO as the operator of the Northwest ICE Processing Center. On April 29, 2024, the State of Washington filed a Notice of Appeal of the order preliminarily enjoining the enforcement of House Bill 1470. 

On April 15, 2024, the Company filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the State of New Jersey for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the State of New Jersey s Assembly Bill 5207 that purports to prohibit the 
 54 

operation of "private detention facilities" in the state, which would prevent the United States from using privately contracted detention facilities to house detainees in the custody of ICE. On April 25, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entered an order preliminarily enjoining the State of New Jersey from enforcing Assembly Bill 5207 against a private detention facility-including any owned by Plaintiff GEO until a further Order of the Court. 
 
 On October 22, 2024, the Company filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California against the State of California and the Kern County Public Health Department for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the State of California s newly enacted law Senate Bill 1132. Senate Bill 1132 purports to empower state agencies with new inspection and investigation powers over GEO s California facilities providing contracted services to ICE. Senate Bill 1132 also purports to impose standards prescribed by the Board of State and Community Corrections on GEO s provision of contracted services to ICE in California. 
 
 Other Litigation 
 
 The nature of the Company's business also exposes it to various other legal claims or litigation, including, but not limited to, civil rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and/or mistreatment, sexual misconduct claims brought by individuals in its care, medical malpractice claims, claims related to deaths in custody, product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims, claims relating to employment matters (including, but not limited to, employment discrimination claims, union grievances and wage and hour claims), property loss claims, environmental claims, automobile liability claims, indemnification claims by its customers and other third-parties, contractual claims and claims for personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with the Company's facilities, programs, electronic monitoring products, personnel or detainees, including damages arising from the escape of an individual in its care or from a disturbance or riot at a facility. Legal proceedings with respect to our facilities are unpredictable and, where material, can cause adverse effects, such as prompting modification or even termination of the underlying facility management contracts. 

Other Assessment 
 
 A state non-income tax audit completed in 2016 included tax periods for which the state tax authority had previously processed a substantial tax refund. At the completion of the audit fieldwork, the Company received a notice of audit findings disallowing deductions that were previously claimed by the Company that was approved by the state tax authority and served as the basis for the approved refund claim. In early January 2017, the Company received a formal Notice of Assessment of Taxes and Demand for Payment from the taxing authority disallowing the deductions. The Company appealed the administrative ruling. In February 2024, the Company received notice that the New Mexico Court of Appeals had ruled against its appeal. The Company appealed this ruling to the New Mexico Supreme Court by timely filing a Petition for Writ of Certiorari on April 19, 2024. On July 8, 2024, the New Mexico Supreme Court denied the Company's Petition for Writ of Certiorari. The Company had established an estimated liability (inclusive of both the audit period and the post-audit period) based on its estimate of the most probable loss based on the facts and circumstances known and the advice of outside counsel in connection with this matter. In July 2024, the Company made a payment of approximately 18.9 million towards the estimated liability related to the assessment for the audited period. Following the submission of an application in September 2024, the Company was accepted to participate in the State's managed audit program and entered into a Managed Audit Agreement (the "Agreement") with the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department for the post-audit period. The Agreement provides for a waiver of penalties and interest and as such, the Company recorded a favorable adjustment for penalties and interest related to the post-audit period of approximately 6.3 million in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Accruals for Legal Proceedings 
 
 The Company establishes accruals for specific legal proceedings when it is considered probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. However, the results of these claims or proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these claims or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including the modification or loss of one or more facility management contracts, or could result in a material impairment of the Company s assets. The Company's accruals for loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as additional information becomes available. The Company generally does not accrue for anticipated legal fees and costs but expenses those items as incurred.
