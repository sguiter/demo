The decrease in the fair value of the Notes was primarily due to a decline in our stock price from the date of the issuance of the Notes. See Note 5 for further discussion of the Notes.

As of October 1, 2024, we were in compliance with all the foregoing covenants in effect at that date. Borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest, at the Company s election, at a rate equal to either: (i) the sum of (A) adjusted term SOFR (as defined in the Loan Agreement, the Term SOFR Rate plus (B) a rate variable based on the Amended Net Adjusted Leverage Ratio, ranging from to , or (ii) the sum of (A) the highest of (x) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the prime rate in effect in the United States, (y) the greater of the rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the federal funds effective rate or the rate that is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the overnight bank funding rate, in either case, plus , and (z) the one-month Term SOFR Rate plus , plus (B) a rate variable based on the Net Adjusted Leverage Ratio, ranging from to . The Company will also pay a fee variable based on the Net Adjusted Leverage Ratio, ranging from to , on the daily amount of unused commitments under the Loan Agreement. Letters of credit bear fees that are equivalent to the interest rate margin that is applicable to revolving loans that bear interest at the adjusted SOFR plus other customary fees charged by the issuing bank. We paid certain customary loan origination fees in conjunction with the Loan Agreement. We are also subject to customary events of default that, if triggered, could result in acceleration of the maturity of the Revolver Facility. Subject to certain exceptions, the Revolver Facility also limits distributions with respect to our equity interests, such as cash dividends and share repurchases, based on a defined ratio, and sets forth negative covenants that restrict indebtedness, liens, investments, sales of assets, fundamental changes and other matters. Convertible Senior Notes On June 15, 2021, we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2026 Notes ). The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were approximately million after deducting issuance costs related to the Notes. The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with our existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent we are not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of our subsidiaries. The Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture (the Base Indenture between us and a trustee Trustee ), dated as of June 15, 2021, as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture (the Supplemental Indenture, and the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture ), dated as of June 15, 2021, between the Company and the Trustee. The Notes accrue interest at a rate of per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2021. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before February 17, 2026, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after February 17, 2026, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. We will have the right to elect to settle conversions either entirely in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. However, upon conversion of any Notes, the conversion value, which will be determined over an Observation Period (as defined in the Indenture) consisting of trading days, will be paid in cash up to at least the principal amount of the Notes being converted. The initial conversion rate is shares of common stock per principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time. As of October 1, 2024, the conversion rate for the Notes was shares of common stock per principal amount of the Notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock. In connection with the cash dividend that was declared by our Board on October 23, 2024, on November 13, 2024 we will adjust the conversion rate (which is expected to increase) and the conversion price (which is expected to decrease) of the Notes in accordance with the terms.

 of the conversion price on (i) each of at least trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date we send the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date we send such notice. However, we may not redeem less than all of the outstanding Notes unless at least million aggregate principal amount of Notes are outstanding and not called for redemption as of the time we send the related redemption notice. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption. If certain corporate events that constitute a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then, subject to a limited exception for certain cash mergers, noteholders may require us to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving us and certain de-listing events with respect to our common stock. The Notes have customary provisions relating to the occurrence of Events of Default (as defined in the Indenture), which include the following: (i) certain payment defaults on the Notes (which, in the case of a default in the payment of interest on the Notes, will be subject to a -day cure period); (ii) our failure to send certain notices under the Indenture within specified periods of time; (iii) our failure to comply with certain covenants in the Indenture relating to our ability to consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, lease or otherwise transfer, in one transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of our assets and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to another person; (iv) a default by us in our other obligations or agreements under the Indenture or the Notes if such default is not cured or waived within after notice is given in accordance with the Indenture; (v) certain defaults by us or any of our significant subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness for borrowed money of at least ; (vi) the rendering of certain judgments against us or any of our significant subsidiaries for the payment of at least , where such judgments are not discharged or stayed within after the date on which the right to appeal has expired or on which all rights to appeal have been extinguished; and (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization involving us or any of our significant subsidiaries. If an Event of Default involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization events with respect to us (and not solely with respect to a significant subsidiary of ours) occurs, then the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the Notes then outstanding will immediately become due and payable without any further action or notice by any person. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then, the Trustee, by notice to us, or noteholders of at least of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, by notice to us and the Trustee, may declare the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the Notes then outstanding to become due and payable immediately. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, we may elect, at our option, that the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to certain failures by us to comply with certain reporting covenants in the Indenture consists exclusively of the right of the noteholders to receive special interest on the Notes for up to at a specified rate per annum not exceeding on the principal amount of the Notes. As of October 1, 2024, the Notes had a gross principal balance of million and a balance of million, net of unamortized issuance costs of million. Total amortization expense was million and million during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, respectively.

The inclusion of supplementary analytical and related information herein may require us to make estimates and assumptions to enable us to fairly present, in all material respects, our analysis of trends and expectations with respect to our results of operations and financial position. Geopolitical and Other Macroeconomic Impacts to our Operating Environment Beginning in 2021, our operating results were impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic events, causing supply chain challenges and significantly increased commodity and wage inflation. While we have seen improvements in many of these areas, some of these factors continue to impact our operating results in fiscal 2024, contributing to significantly increased commodity and other costs. We have also encountered delays in opening new restaurants primarily due to delays in permitting and landlord readiness, as well as supply chain challenges. The ongoing impact of geopolitical and macroeconomic events could lead to further shifts in consumer behavior, wage inflation, staffing challenges, product and services cost inflation, disruptions in the supply chain and delay in new restaurant openings. Climate change may further exacerbate a number of these factors. For more information regarding the risks to our business relating to the geopolitical and macroeconomic events, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2024. General The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated is a leader in experiential dining. We are culinary forward and relentlessly focused on hospitality. We currently own and operate 344 restaurants throughout the United States and Canada under brands including The Cheesecake Factory (215 locations), North Italia (40 locations), Flower Child (35 locations) and additional brands within our FRC portfolio (47 locations). Internationally, 34 The Cheesecake Factory restaurants operate under licensing agreements. Our bakery division operates two facilities that produce quality cheesecakes and other baked products for our restaurants, international licensees and third-party bakery customers. Overview Our strategy is driven by our commitment to customer satisfaction and is focused primarily on menu innovation, service and operational execution to continue to differentiate ourselves from other restaurant concepts, as well as to drive competitively strong performance that is sustainable. Financially, we are focused on prudently managing expenses at our restaurants, bakery facilities and corporate support center, and leveraging our size to make the best use of our purchasing power. Investing in new Company-owned restaurant development is our top long-term capital allocation priority, with a focus on opening our concepts in premier locations within both new and existing markets. We plan to continue expanding The Cheesecake Factory, North Italia concepts, Flower Child and in addition, our FRC subsidiary serves as an incubation engine,innovating new food, dining and hospitality experiences to create fresh, exciting concepts. Our overall revenue growth is primarily driven by revenues from new restaurant openings and increases in comparable restaurant sales.

 For The Cheesecake Factory concept, our strategy is to increase comparable restaurant sales by growing average check and maintaining customer traffic through (1) continuing to offer innovative, high quality menu items that offer customers a wide range of options in terms of flavor, price and value, (2) focusing on service and hospitality with the goal of delivering an exceptional customer experience and (3) continuing to provide our customers with convenient options for off-premise dining. We are continuing our efforts on a number of initiatives, including menu innovation, a greater focus on increasing customer throughput in our restaurants, leveraging our gift card program, working with a third party to provide delivery services for our restaurants, increasing customer awareness of our online ordering capabilities, improving the pick-up experience, augmenting our marketing programs, including our Cheesecake Rewards program, enhancing our training programs and leveraging our customer satisfaction measurement platform. Average check variations are driven by menu price increases and/or changes in menu mix. We generally update The Cheesecake Factory menus twice each year, and our philosophy is to use price increases to help offset key operating cost increases in a manner that balances support of both our margin objectives and customer traffic levels, utilizing a market-based strategy to help mitigate cost pressure in higher-wage geographies. Prior to fiscal 2022, we targeted menu price increases of approximately 2 to 3 annually. Beginning in 2022, we have implemented menu price increases above our historical levels to help offset significant inflationary cost pressures. Current and future near-term pricing actions may also be at levels above historical norms to keep pace with any significant cost increases. In addition, on a regular basis, we carefully consider opportunities to adjust our menu offerings or ingredients to help manage product availability and cost. Margins are subject to fluctuations in commodity costs, labor, restaurant-level occupancy expenses, general and administrative G A expenses and preopening expenses. Our objective is to recapture our pre-COVID-19 pandemic margins and longer-term to drive margin expansion, by leveraging incremental sales to increase restaurant-level margins at The Cheesecake Factory concept, leveraging our bakery operations, international and consumer packaged goods royalty revenue streams and G A expense over time, and optimizing our restaurant portfolio. We plan to employ a balanced capital allocation strategy comprised of investing in new restaurants that are expected to meet our targeted returns, repaying borrowings under our Revolving Facility and returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs, the latter of which offsets dilution from our equity compensation program and supports our earnings per share growth. Future decisions to pay or to increase or decrease dividends or to repurchase shares are at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent on a number of factors, including limitations pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement and applicable law. Longer-term, we believe our domestic revenue growth (comprised of our targeted annual unit growth of 7 , in aggregate across concepts, and comparable sales growth), combined with margin expansion, planned debt repayments and an anticipated capital return program will support our long-term financial objective of 13 to 14 total return to shareholders, on average. We define our total return as earnings per share growth plus our dividend yield.

 Results of Operations The following table presents, for the periods indicated, information from our condensed consolidated statements of income expressed as percentages of revenues. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year. 

Thirteen Thirteen Thirty-Nine Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended Weeks Ended Weeks Ended Weeks Ended October 1, 2024 October 3, 2023 October 1, 2024 October 3, 2023 Revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Costs and expenses: Food and beverage costs 22.6 23.5 22.6 23.5 Labor expenses 35.9 36.3 35.7 35.9 Other operating costs and expenses 27.7 27.6 26.9 26.7 General and administrative expenses 6.5 6.5 6.4 6.4 Depreciation and amortization expenses 2.9 2.8 2.8 2.7 Impairment of assets and lease termination (income)/expenses (0.4) 0.0 (0.1) 0.1 Acquisition-related contingent consideration, compensation and amortization expenses 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.2 Preopening costs 0.8 0.8 0.7 0.6 Total costs and expenses 96.1 97.7 95.1 96.1 Income from operations 3.9 2.3 4.9 3.9 Interest and other expense, net (0.2) (0.3) (0.2) (0.2) Income before income taxes 3.7 2.0 4.7 3.7 Income tax provision/(benefit) 0.2 (0.2) 0.4 0.2 Net income 3.5 2.2 4.3 3.5 Thirteen Weeks Ended October 1, 2024 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended October 3, 2023 Revenues Revenues increased 4.3 to 865.5 million for the fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2024 compared to 830.2 million for the comparable prior year period, primarily due to additional revenue related to new restaurant openings and an increase in comparable restaurant sales. The Cheesecake Factory sales increased 3.1 to 647.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 628.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Average sales per restaurant operating week increased 1.4 to 231,011 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 227,917 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Total operating weeks at The Cheesecake Factory restaurants increased 1.7 to 2,804 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 2,756 in the prior year. The Cheesecake Factory comparable sales increased by 1.6 , or 9.6 million, from the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in average check of 2.4 (based on an increase of 4.5 in menu pricing and partially offset by 2.1 negative impact from mix), partially offset by decreased customer traffic of 0.8 . We implemented effective menu price increases of approximately 2.5 and 2.0 in the first and third quarters of fiscal 2024, respectively. Sales through the off-premise channel comprised approximately 21 of our restaurant sales during the third quarter of both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. We account for each off-premise order as one customer for traffic measurement purposes. Therefore, average check is generally higher for off-premise orders as most are for more than one customer. North Italia sales increased 15.2 to 71.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to 62.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Average sales per restaurant operating week decreased 2.6 to 141,771 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 145,494 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Total operating weeks at North Italia increased 18.2 to 507 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 429 in the prior year. North Italia comparable sales increased approximately 2 from the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in average check of 4 (based on an increase of 6 in menu pricing, partially offset by a 2 negative impact from mix), partially offset by decreased customer traffic of 2 . We implemented effective menu price 

 19 

Table of Contents 
 increases of approximately 2.2 and 3.7 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, respectively. We are in the process of implementing approximately a 2.3 price increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Flower Child sales increased 13.7 to 36.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to 32.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Flower Child sales per restaurant operating week increased 6.5 to 85,225 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to 80,006 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Total operating weeks at Flower Child increased 6.7 to 430 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 403 in the prior year. Other FRC sales increased 14.3 to 67.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to 58.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Other FRC average sales per restaurant operating week decreased 4.4 to 116,493 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 121,916 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Average sales per restaurant operating week were impacted by new restaurant openings, as well as the concept mix and a decline in comparable sales. Total operating weeks at Other FRC increased 19.5 to 575 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 481 in the prior year. Restaurants become eligible to enter the comparable sales base in their 19 th month of operation. As of October 1, 2024, there were seven The Cheesecake Factory restaurants and six North Italia restaurants not yet in their respective comparable sales bases. International licensed locations and restaurants that are no longer in operation, including those which we have relocated, are excluded from comparable sales calculations. Food and Beverage Costs Food and beverage costs consist of raw materials and ingredients used in the food and beverage products sold in our restaurants and to our third-party bakery customers. As a percentage of revenues, food and beverage costs were 22.6 and 23.5 in the third quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to menu price increases in excess of inflation across most categories (0.7 and a shift in sales mix (0.2 ). Labor Expenses As a percentage of revenues, labor expenses, which include restaurant-level labor costs and bakery production labor, including associated fringe benefits, were 35.9 and 36.3 in the third quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease is primarily driven by menu price increases in excess of wage rate inflation and improved productivity (1.0 ), partially offset by higher group medical costs due to large claim activity (0.5 ). Other Operating Costs and Expenses Other operating costs and expenses consist of all other restaurant-level operating costs, the major components of which are occupancy expenses (rent, common area expenses, insurance, licenses, taxes and utilities), dining room and to-go supplies, repairs and maintenance, janitorial expenses, credit card processing fees, marketing including delivery commissions, incentive compensation and bakery production overhead. As a percentage of revenues, other operating costs and expenses were 27.7 and 27.6 in the third quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. This variance was primarily driven by increased restaurant-level incentive compensation expense (0.2 ), partially offset by a shift in sales mix (0.2 ). G A Expenses G A expenses consist of the restaurant management recruiting and training program, restaurant field supervision, corporate support and bakery administrative organizations and gift card commissions to third-party distributors. As a percentage of revenues, G A expenses were 6.5 in both the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023. This was primarily due to the timing of operational leadership meetings (0.3 ), partially offset by higher legal fees (0.2 ). Impairment of Assets and Lease Termination (Income)/Expenses During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded impairment of assets and lease terminations income of 3.5 million primarily related to lease termination income, net for two The Cheesecake Factory restaurants and one Social Monk location. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded impairment of assets and lease terminations expense of 48,000.

 Preopening Costs Preopening costs were 7.0 million and 6.7 million in the third quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. We opened one Flower Child and three Other FRC locations in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to two The Cheesecake Factory locations in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Restaurant-level preopening costs include all costs to relocate and compensate restaurant management staff members during the preopening period, costs to recruit and train hourly restaurant staff members, and wages, travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support staff members. Also included in preopening costs are expenses for maintaining a roster of trained managers for pending openings, the associated temporary housing and other costs necessary to relocate managers in alignment with future restaurant opening and operating needs. Preopening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the number, mix and timing of restaurant openings and the specific preopening costs incurred for each restaurant. Income Tax Provision/(Benefit) Our effective income tax rate was 5.8 and (5.5 for the third quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to leverage on higher annual forecasted income before taxes, predominantly related to employment credits, (6.2 ), a larger cumulative benefit recorded in fiscal 2023 resulting from a decline in the effective tax rate from the second quarter to the third quarter (5.3 and a smaller reduction to our reserve for uncertain tax positions (1.6 ). These factors were offset by a higher amount of non-taxable gains on our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our non-qualified deferred compensation plan (1.2 ). Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended October 1, 2024 Compared to Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended October 3, 2023 Revenues Revenues increased 3.8 to 2,660.7 million for the first nine months ended October 1, 2024 compared to 2,562.5 million for the comparable prior year period, primarily due to additional revenue related to new restaurant openings and an increase in comparable restaurant sales. The Cheesecake Factory sales increased 2.9 to 1,992.2 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to 1,936.6 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Average sales per restaurant operating week increased 0.5 to 236,637 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 from 235,398 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Total operating weeks at The Cheesecake Factory restaurants increased 2.3 to 8,419 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to 8,227 in the prior year. The Cheesecake Factory comparable sales increased by 0.8 , or 14.9 million, from the first nine months of fiscal 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in average check of 1.6 (based on an increase of 4.7 in menu pricing and partially offset by 3.1 negative impact from mix), partially offset by decreased customer traffic of 0.8 . Sales through the off-premise channel comprised approximately 21 of our restaurant sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to 22 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. North Italia sales increased 13.9 to 218.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, compared to 191.7 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Average sales per restaurant operating week decreased 1.4 to 146,881 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 from 148,915 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Total operating weeks at North Italia increased 15.5 to 1,486 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to 1,287 in the prior year. North Italia comparable sales increased approximately 2 from the first nine months of fiscal 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in average check of 3 (based on an increase of 7 in menu pricing, partially offset by a 4 negative impact from mix), partially offset by decreased customer traffic of 1 . Flower Child sales increased 10.1 to 106.8 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, compared to 97.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Flower Child sales per restaurant operating week increased 4.7 to 84,929 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 from 81,136 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Total operating weeks at Flower Child increased 5.2 to 1,258 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to 1,196 in the prior year. Other FRC sales increased 11.3 to 214.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, compared to 193.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Other FRC average sales per restaurant operating week decreased 6.2 to 129,897 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 from 138,458 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Average sales per restaurant operating week were

 impacted by new restaurant openings, as well as the concept mix and a decline in comparable sales. Total operating weeks at Other FRC increased 18.7 to 1,654 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to 1,394 in the prior year. Food and Beverage Costs As a percentage of revenues, food and beverage costs were 22.6 and 23.5 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to menu price increases in excess of inflation across most categories (0.5 and a shift in sales mix (0.3 ). Labor Expenses As a percentage of revenues, labor expenses were 35.7 and 35.9 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease is primarily due to menu price increases in excess of wage rate inflation (0.5 ), partially offset by increased management labor due to improved staffing levels (0.2 and higher group medical costs due to large claim activity (0.2 ). Other Operating Costs and Expenses As a percentage of revenues, other operating costs and expenses were 26.9 and 26.7 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. This variance was primarily driven by increased restaurant-level incentive compensation expense (0.2 ), partially offset by a shift in sales mix (0.2 ). G A Expenses As a percentage of revenues, G A expenses were 6.4 in both the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. Impairment of Assets and Lease Termination (Income)/Expenses During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we recorded impairment of assets and lease terminations income of 1.6 million primarily related to lease termination income, net for two The Cheesecake Factory restaurants, one Grand Lux Cafe location, one Flower Child location and one Social Monk location. During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we recorded impairment of assets and lease terminations expense of 1.6 million primarily related to lease termination costs for one Grand Lux Cafe location. Preopening Costs Preopening costs were 19.9 million and 15.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. We opened one The Cheesecake Factory, three North Italia, four Flower Child and six Other FRC locations in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to three The Cheesecake Factory, one Flower Child and three Other FRC locations in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate was 8.0 and 6.0 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to leverage on higher annual forecasted income before taxes, predominantly related to employment credits, (4.1 ). This was partially offset by a higher amount of non-taxable gains on our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our non-qualified deferred compensation plan (1.2 ). Non-GAAP Measures Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We calculate these non-GAAP measures by eliminating from net income and diluted net income per share the impact of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operations. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items. In the future, we may incur expenses or generate income similar to the adjusted items.

 Fiscal 2024 Outlook Based on recent trends and assuming no material operating or consumer disruptions, we anticipate total revenue for fiscal 2024 to be approximately 3.57 billion. During fiscal 2024, we currently estimate total inflation across our commodities, total labor (factoring in the latest trends in wage rates and channel mix, as well as in other components such as payroll taxes and benefits) and other operating costs and expenses to be in the low to mid-single digit range. We estimate G A expenses to be slightly higher than fiscal 2023 as a percent of sales and preopening costs of approximately 28 million. Based on these factors, we expect fiscal 2024 net income margin of approximately 4.5 based on the estimated revenue provided. We plan to open as many as 22 new restaurants in fiscal 2024, including as many as three The Cheesecake Factory restaurants, six North Italia restaurants, six to seven Flower Child locations and eight restaurants within our Other FRC business. We anticipate approximately 180 to 200 million in cash capital expenditures to support this level of unit development, as well as required maintenance on our restaurants. Estimate includes new restaurant construction expenses which are classified as operating lease assets in the statement of cash flows. Restaurant opening dates may be impacted by supply chain challenges and permit approval delays. Total revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 are expected to be between 905 million and 915 million. We anticipate commodity inflation to be in the low-single digit range and expect labor inflation to be in the low to mid-single digit range. Based on these factors, we expect fourth quarter fiscal 2024 net income margin of 4.8 to 4.9 based on the estimated revenue range provided. Fiscal 2025 Outlook Based on our fiscal 2024 year-to-date performance and assuming no material operating or consumer disruptions, we anticipate total revenue for fiscal 2025 to be approximately 3.75 billion. We anticipate commodity and net labor inflation to be in the low to mid-single digit range. We expect G A expenses to be slightly better than fiscal 2024 as a percent of sales, depreciation expense of approximately 106 million and preopening costs of approximately 30 million. Based on these factors, we expect fiscal 2025 net income margin of approximately 4.75 at the mid-point of the estimated revenue provided.

 Our development expectations for 2025 are to continue accelerating unit growth, with as many as 24 new restaurant openings. We anticipate approximately 190 million to 210 million in cash capital expenditures to support this level of unit development, required maintenance on our restaurants and our preliminary capital estimate for the initial phase of development for the third bakery facility. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our corporate financial objectives are to maintain a sufficiently strong and conservative balance sheet to support our operating initiatives and unit growth while maintaining financial flexibility to provide the financial resources necessary to protect and enhance the competitiveness of our restaurant and bakery brands and to provide a prudent level of financial capacity to manage the risks and uncertainties of conducting our business operations under various economic and industry cycles. Typically, cash flows generated from operating activities are our principal source of liquidity, which we use to finance our restaurant expansion plans, ongoing maintenance of our restaurants and bakery facilities and investment in our corporate and information technology infrastructures. Similar to many restaurant and retail chain store operations, we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations. Accordingly, our lease arrangements reduce, to some extent, our capacity to utilize funded indebtedness in our capital structure. We are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants. However, we believe our operating lease arrangements continue to provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 4.1 million to 52.2 million. The following table presents, for the periods indicated, a summary of our key cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities (in millions): 

Thirty-Nine Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended Weeks Ended October 1, 2024 October 3, 2023 Cash provided by operating activities 174.3 150.5 Additions to property and equipment (120.5) (99.9) Acquisition-related deferred consideration and compensation (24.2) Common stock dividends paid (39.8) (40.1) Treasury stock purchases, inclusive of excise tax (17.5) (36.3) Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash flows from operations increased by 23.8 million from the first nine months of fiscal 2023 primarily due higher net income and an increase in accounts payables due to a lower balance in fiscal 2023, partially offset by an increase in inventory levels and a payment of deferred consideration and compensation related to the FRC acquisition in excess of acquisition-date fair value. Typically, our requirement for working capital has not been significant since our restaurant customers pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or cash equivalents at the time of sale, and we are able to sell many of our restaurant inventory items before payment is due to the suppliers of such items. Property and Equipment Capital expenditures for new restaurants, including locations under development, were 76.1 million and 61.6 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures also included 38.1 million and 34.2 million for our existing restaurants and 6.3 million and 4.1 million for bakery and corporate capacity and infrastructure investments in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. We opened 14 restaurants in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 comprised of one The Cheesecake Factory, three North Italia, four Flower Child and six Other FRC locations compared to three The Cheesecake Factory, one Flower Child and three Other FRC locations in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. We expect to open as many as 22 new restaurants in fiscal 2024 across our portfolio of concepts. We anticipate approximately 180 to 200 million in capital expenditures to support this level of unit development, as well as required maintenance on our restaurants. Estimate includes new restaurant construction expenses which are classified as operating lease assets in the statement of cash flows.

 Acquisition-Related Deferred Consideration and Compensation During the first nine months of 2023, we made payments of 24.2 million for deferred consideration and compensation related to the FRC acquisition. During the first nine months of 2024, we made payments of 6.5 million for deferred consideration and compensation related to the FRC acquisition that was included in cash provided by operating activities. Convertible Senior Notes On June 15, 2021, we issued 345.0 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes Notes ), which will mature on June 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were approximately 334.9 million after deducting issuance costs related to the Notes. As of October 1, 2024, the conversion rate for the Notes was 13.7961 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately 72.48 per share of common stock. In connection with the cash dividend that was declared by our Board on October 23, 2024, on November 13, 2024 we will adjust the conversion rate (which is expected to increase) and the conversion price (which is expected to decrease) of the Notes in accordance with the terms. (See Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further discussion of the Notes.) Credit Facility On October 6, 2022, we entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement and the revolving credit facility provided thereunder, the Revolver Facility ). The Loan Agreement amends and restates in its entirety our prior credit agreement. The Revolver Facility, which terminates on October 6, 2027, provides us with revolving loan commitments that total 400 million, of which 50 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit. The Revolver Facility contains a commitment increase feature that, subject to certain conditions precedent, could provide for an additional 200 million in revolving loan commitments. Our obligations under the Revolver Facility are unsecured. Certain of our material subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the Revolver Facility. As of October 1, 2024, we had net availability for borrowings of 236.5 million, based on a 130.0 million outstanding debt balance and 33.5 million in standby letters of credit under the Revolver Facility. Under the Revolver Facility, we are subject to financial covenants, as well as to customary events of default that, if triggered, could result in acceleration of the maturity of the Revolver Facility. Subject to certain exceptions, the Revolver Facility also limits distributions with respect to our equity interests, such as cash dividends and share repurchases, based on a defined ratio, and sets forth negative covenants that restrict indebtedness, liens, investments, sales of assets, fundamental changes and other matters. (See Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further discussion of our long-term debt.) Common Stock Dividends Common stock dividends of 39.8 million and 40.1 million were paid in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. As further discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report, in October 2024, our Board declared a quarterly dividend to be paid in November 2024. Future decisions to pay or to increase or decrease dividends are at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent on our operating performance, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, limitations on cash distributions pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement and applicable law, and other such factors that the Board considers relevant. Share Repurchases Under authorization by our Board to repurchase up to 61.0 million shares of our common stock, we have cumulatively repurchased 57.0 million shares at a total cost of 1,829.2 million, excluding excise tax through October 1, 2024. We repurchased 0.5 million shares at a cost of 17.5 million, excluding excise tax during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to 1.1 million shares at a cost of 36.3 million, excluding excise tax during the comparable fiscal 2023 period.

Table of Contents 
 Our objectives with regard to share repurchases have been to offset the dilution to our shares outstanding that results from equity compensation grants and to supplement our earnings per share growth. Our share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, does not require us to purchase a specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time. Future decisions to repurchase shares are at the discretion of the Board and are based on several factors, including current and forecasted operating cash flows, capital needs associated with new restaurant development and maintenance of existing locations, dividend payments, debt levels and cost of borrowing, obligations associated with the FRC acquisition, our share price and current market conditions. The timing and number of shares repurchased are also subject to legal constraints and financial covenants under our Loan Agreement that limit share repurchases based on a defined ratio. (See Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further discussion of our repurchase authorization.) Cash Flow Outlook We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, combined with expected cash flows provided by operations and available borrowings under the Revolving Facility, will provide us with adequate liquidity for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. As of October 1, 2024, we had no financing transactions, arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties. Additionally, we had no financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting periods covered by the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting estimates have not changed materially from those previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2024. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a summary of new accounting standards.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The following discussion of market risks contains forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part I, Item 1 of this report and with the following items in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2024: the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part IV, Item 15; the Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A; the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7; and the cautionary statements included throughout the report. Actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on general conditions in the commodity and financial markets. The cost of products and services used in our operations is subject to volatility due to the relative availability of labor and distribution, weather, natural disasters, inventory levels and other supply and/or demand impacting events such as geopolitical events, economic conditions or other unforeseen circumstances. Climate change may further exacerbate a number of these factors. Beginning in fiscal 2021, our operating results were impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic events, causing supply chain challenges and significantly increased commodity and wage inflation. While we have seen improvements in many of these areas, some of these factors continue to impact our operating results in fiscal 2024, contributing to significantly increased commodity and other costs. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements for some of our principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, such as certain dairy products and poultry, depending on market conditions and expected demand. While we are in the process of contracting for certain key food and non-food supplies for fiscal 2025, these efforts may not be successful or yield our intended benefits. We continue to evaluate the possibility of entering into similar arrangements for other commodities and periodically evaluate hedging vehicles, such as direct financial instruments, to assist us in managing risk and variability associated with such commodities. As of October 1, 2024, we had no hedging contracts in place. Commodities for which we have not entered into contracts can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations, which at times may be significant. Additionally, the cost of commodities subject to governmental regulation, such as dairy and corn, can be especially susceptible to price fluctuation. Goods we purchase on the international market may be subject to even greater fluctuations in cost and availability, which could result from a variety of factors, including the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, international trade disputes, tariffs, geopolitical unrest and varying global demand. We may not have the ability to increase menu prices or vary menu items in response to food commodity price increases. For the third quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2023, a hypothetical increase of 1 in food costs would have negatively impacted cost of sales by 2.0 million and 1.9 million, respectively. We are exposed to market risk from interest rate changes on our funded debt. This exposure relates to the component of the interest rate on our Loan Agreement that is indexed to market rates. Based on outstanding borrowings at both October 1, 2024 and January 2, 2024, a hypothetical 1 rise in interest rates would have increased interest expense by 1.3 million, on an annual basis. (See Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further discussion of our long-term debt.) We are also subject to market risk related to our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our non-qualified plans to the extent these investments are not equivalent to the related liability. In addition, because changes in these investments are not taxable, gains and losses result in tax benefit and tax expense, respectively, and directly affect net income through the income tax provision. Based on balances at October 1, 2024 and January 2, 2024, a hypothetical 10 decline in the market value of our deferred compensation asset and related liability would not have impacted income before income taxes. However, under such a scenario, net income would have declined by 2.8 million and 2.4 million at October 1, 2024 and January 2, 2024, respectively. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was necessarily required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship 

 27 

Table of Contents 
 of possible controls and procedures. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of October 1, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. See Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Item 1A. Risk Factors. A description of the risk factors associated with our business is contained in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2024 Annual Report ). These cautionary statements are to be used as a reference in connection with any forward-looking statements. The factors, risks and uncertainties identified in these cautionary statements are in addition to those contained in any other cautionary statements, written or oral, which may be made or otherwise addressed in connection with a forward-looking statement or contained in any of our subsequent filings with the SEC. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors since the filing of our Annual Report. If any of our third-party vendors experiences a failure that affects a significant aspect of our business, we may experience data loss, increased costs, operational disruption or other harm, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. In order to leverage our internal resources and information technology infrastructure, and to support our business continuity and disaster recovery planning efforts, we rely on third-party vendors to provide some of our essential business processes. For example, we rely on a network of third-party distribution warehouses to deliver ingredients and other materials to our restaurants. In some instances, these processes rely on technology and may be outsourced to the vendor in their entirety and in other instances we utilize these vendors externally-hosted business applications. Our vendors systems have experienced cybersecurity incidents, including credential stuffing attacks in which compromised user credentials were used to breach the systems, and are vulnerable to a variety of risks, including, without limitation, theft, casualties such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external cybersecurity threats, including from diverse threat actors, such as state-sponsored organizations, opportunistic hackers and hacktivists, as well as through diverse attack vectors, such as malfeasance by insiders, human or technological error, malicious code embedded in open-source software, or misconfigurations, bugs or other vulnerabilities in commercial software that is integrated into our (or our suppliers or service providers network infrastructure, products or services, security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms, malware, ransomware, social engineering/phishing, breaches of the algorithms used to encrypt and protect data and other malicious, or disruptive or unauthorized events that jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information systems or information residing therein, including confidential information and personal information (each, a Cybersecurity Incident and collectively, Cybersecurity Incidents ). For example, in July 2024, we experienced disruptions to our information technology systems as part of the CrowdStrike software update that resulted in global information technology outages, including disruptions to our ability to process customer payments at certain of our restaurants. While we experienced this disruption for a limited period of time, the incident did not have a significant impact on our business. We also rely on third party services to effectively operate our restaurants including, for example, gift card distribution and transaction processing services, point-of-sale system services, online ordering services and food delivery services, and our Cheesecake Rewards program. We derive substantial revenue from these aspects of our business, which could suffer in the event of any factor that adversely impacts our vendors ability to provide such services. Such factors include, without limitation, loss of, or significant change in contractual terms of, key vendor contracts, vendor or processor failures, technology failures, changes in applicable laws or regulations, Security

Table of Contents 
 Incidents, damage to the reputation of any key vendor and mandated employment relationships between companies that facilitate third-party delivery services and their service personnel. (See the risk factor titled Changes in, or any failure to comply with, applicable laws or regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our restaurants and/or increase our cost to do so, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended January 2, 2024.) We continue to review options to expand the use of third-party providers in other areas. Our general practice is to seek to work with service providers that are leading performers in their industries and with technology vendors that we understand employ up-to-date and appropriate data security practices and internal control practices. However, we cannot guarantee that failures will not occur. The failure of third-party vendors to provide adequate services, including, as result of any Security Incident, or to generally fail to employ up-to-date and appropriate data security and internal control practices, could significantly harm our operations and reputation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. The following table presents our purchases of our common stock during the fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2024: 

Total Number of Maximum Number Shares Purchased of Shares that May Total Number as Part of Publicly Yet be Purchased of Shares Average Price Announced Plans Under the Plans or Period Purchased (1) Paid per Share (2) or Programs Programs July 3 August 6, 2024 29,164 37.35 0 3,953,098 August 7 September 3, 2024 286 38.36 0 3,952,812 September 4 October 1, 2024 3,952,812 Total 29,450 0 

 (1) The total number of shares purchased include 29,450 shares withheld upon vesting of restricted share awards to satisfy tax withholding obligations. (2) The dollar value of shares repurchased excludes excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Under authorization by our Board to repurchase up to 61.0 million shares of our common stock, we have cumulatively repurchased 57.0 million shares at a total cost of 1,829.2 million, excluding excise tax, through October 1, 2024 with 29,450 shares repurchased at a cost of 1.1 million, excluding excise tax during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Our share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, does not require us to purchase a specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time. The timing and number of shares repurchased are subject to legal constraints and financial covenants under our Loan Agreement that limit share repurchases based on a defined ratio. (See Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further discussion of our repurchase authorization.) Item 5. Other Information. During the fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (in each case, as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).
