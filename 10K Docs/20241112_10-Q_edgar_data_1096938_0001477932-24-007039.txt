Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with SEC on April 1, 2024. Company Overview UHP develops, manufactures, and markets a patented hemostatic gauze for the healthcare and wound care sectors. Our gauze product, CelluSTAT , is derived from cotton and designed to absorb exudate/drainage from superficial wounds and help control bleeding. We are in the process of seeking regulatory approval to sell our hemostatic gauze product line into the U.S. Class III and European CE Mark human surgical markets. Our CelluSTAT Gauze Products CelluSTAT hemostatic gauze is a natural substance created from chemically treated cellulose derived from cotton. It is an effective hemostatic agent registered with the FDA for superficial use under a 510(k) approval obtained in 2012 to help control bleeding from open wounds and body cavities. The CelluSTAT hemostatic material contains no chemical additives, thrombin, collagen or animal-derived products, and is hypoallergenic. When the product comes in contact with blood it expands slightly and quickly converts to a translucent gel that subsequently breaks down into cellulose and salts. Because of its benign impact on body tissue and the fact that it degrades to non-toxic end products, CelluSTAT does not impede the healing of body tissue as compared to certain competing hemostatic products. CelluSTAT (formerly branded as HemoStyp) hemostatic gauze is a flexible, silk-like material that is applied by placing the gauze onto the bleeding tissue. The supple material can be easily folded and manipulated as needed to fit the size of the wound or incision. In surface bleeding and surgical situations, the product quickly converts to a translucent gel that allows the physician or surgeon to monitor the coagulation process. The gel maintains a neutral pH level, which avoids damaging the surrounding tissue. In superficial bleeding situations, CelluSTAT can be bonded to an adhesive plastic bandage or integrated into a traditional gauze component to address a broad range of needs, including traumatic bleeding injuries and prolonged bleeding following hemodialysis. Background and Developments In 2012, the Company began marketing its CelluSTAT hemostatic gauze for human topical and dental applications as well as for and veterinary surgical applications under an FDA 510k approval. In 2018, the Company determined to pursue a Class III designation to market its hemostatic gauze under an FDA Premarket Approval as an adjunct product to achieve hemostasis in human surgical applications. In February 2018, the Company completed and submitted to the FDA all materials relevant for the pre-market approval (or PMA) for CelluSTAT as a Class III application for internal surgical procedures. Since our initial PMA submission, we have conducted a human trial and have worked to address certain deficiencies in our PMA application that were identified by the FDA. On March 21, 2024, we submitted results of the human clinical trial and other information, including our manufacturing, sterilization and shipping processes, to the FDA. On June 18, 2024, the FDA issued a customary "Deficiencies Letter" to the company listing certain questions and comments on various elements of the application. The letter contained approximately 40 specific comments and requests for additional information covering the device description, sterility shelf life, clinical performance testing, and biocompatibility sections of the PMA application. The FDA's 180-day PMA application review period will be paused while we develop responses to the deficiencies that were identified and will resume once all the responses have been submitted. 17 Table of Contents On August 15, 2024, we submitted a Submission Issue Request (SIR) to the FDA outlining its plan to address and respond to the FDA Deficiencies Letter. On September 16, 2024, at the FDA s request, the Company submitted a condensed list of questions relating to the prior SIR submission. On October 29. 2024, the Company and FDA conducted a virtual meeting to discuss the SIR and the condensed list of questions. From September 23 through October 4, 2024, the FDA conducted a Bioresearch Monitoring Program (BIMO) Inspection of our records and procedures relating to our 2019 clinical study, following which the FDA delivered its Inspectional Observations on Form 483. On October 25, 2024, we submitted our response to the observations on the Form 483, which the FDA will consider in developing its final report on the BIMO Inspection. On October 29, 2024, the Company and its regulatory consultant met with the FDA s PMA application review committee. The purpose of the meeting was to present, discuss and seek feedback from the FDA on our proposed resolutions to the deficiencies. Topics discussed include our clinical testing (including the results of the human trial), biocompatibility, product sterilization and shelf life. During the discussion, the Company noted the results of its clinical trial involving 232 patients (of whom 118 were treated with its hemostatic gauze) that showed both non-inferiority and superiority for time to hemostasis using CelluSTAT relative to the standard of care and showed no evidence of heterogeneity of results across procedure categories, surgeons, or clinical sites, indicating both poolability and generalizability of study results. The Company also noted that none of the adverse events that occurred during the study were attributable to its hemostatic gauze product. The FDA requested more data to confirm the safety and effectiveness of CelluSTAT in surgical procedures in the intestinal and thoracic organ space, where organ movement can impact the post operative stability of a hemostat and where observation of post operative rebleeding is more difficult. To address this concern, we have proposed to enroll a limited number of human subjects in a multi-site study as an extension of the original pivotal study, with patients undergoing surgical procedures within the organ space. The supplemental study process will consist of submitting an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) for FDA approval, identifying and contracting suitable surgical sites, enrolling patents, and data collection and analysis. There can be no assurance that our PMA application will be approved. Potential Target Markets Our CelluSTAT material is currently cut to several sizes and configuration and marketed as CelluSTAT Gauze. While we have paused our commercial activities to focus on our Class III PMA application, our potential customer base includes, without limitation, the following: Hospitals and Surgery Centers for all Internal Surgical usage (in the event we obtain FDA Class III approval) Hospitals, Clinics and Physicians for external trauma EMS, Fire Departments and other First Responders Military Medical Care Providers Hemodialysis centers Nursing Homes and Assisted Living Facilities Dental and Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Offices Veterinary hospitals Primary Strategy Our CelluSTAT technology received an FDA 510(k) approval in 2012 for use in external or superficial bleeding situations and we believe there is an opportunity for CelluSTAT products to address unmet needs in several medical applications that represent attractive commercial opportunities. However, the Class III human surgical markets, both domestic and international, represent the most attractive market for our products due to the smaller number of competitors offering Class III approved hemostatic agents and the resulting premium pricing for products that can meet the demanding requirements of the human surgical environment. We believe that our extensive laboratory testing and our completed human trial indicate that the CelluSTAT technology could successfully compete against established Class III market participants, and could gain a significant market share. As discussed above, we are in the process of seeking FDA pre-market approval for our CelluSTAT product. There can be no assurance that an FDA PMA will be granted. In anticipation of receiving a Class III PMA (which cannot be assured), we are evaluating paths to rapidly grow our revenue and profits in all potential market segments, with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. We do not intend to pursue the full commercialization of our products independently nor to remain an independent company in the long term. Options under consideration include (i) a sale or merger of the Company with an industry leader in the wound care and surgical device sectors, which may include a pre-sale collaboration on commercialization and distribution and (ii) one or more commercial partnerships with established market participants, without any specific, associated sale or merger transaction. 18 Table of Contents The Company has been contacted by several medical technology companies that are active in the surgical equipment and hemostatic products sectors, and who have expressed an interest in the Company s products and business strategy. We continue to evaluate the potential commercial partnerships in anticipation of an FDA decision on our Class III PMA application. No assurances can be given that the Company will identify any commercialization candidate(s) or enter into a transaction. Manufacturing and Packaging of our Products The Company s products will be manufactured to our specifications through a contract manufacturing arrangement with an FDA certified supplier that maintains stringent quality control protocols to assure the uniformity and quality of all of our gauze products. Information on the manufacturing process and our manufacturer s facility has been submitted as part of our PMA submission. Our gauze products are cut to size, packaged and sterilized by service providers in the United States. Patents and Trademarks Our hemostatic gauze technology is protected through patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which protection currently runs through 2029. The Company has registered trademarks and trademark applications for the following product formats: BooBoo Strips HEMOSTYP The Ultimate Bandage HemoStrip CelluSTAT Nik Fix 19 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the three months ending September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table sets forth a summary of certain key financial information for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Revenue - - Gross profit - - Operating (expenses) (391,903 (450,451 Operating (loss) (391,903 (450,451 Other income (expense) 88,241 (35,281 Net (loss) (303,662 (485,732 Net loss per common share - basic and diluted (0.00 (0.00 Three Months ended September 30, 2024 versus Three Months ended September 30, 2023 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 0 of revenues.

The decrease in the net loss is due to the Company having a decrease in operating expenses of 58,548 and a decrease in other expense of 123,522, as explained above. 20 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table sets forth a summary of certain key financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Revenue - - Gross profit - - Operating (expenses) (1,222,174 (1,979,882 Operating (loss) (1,222,174 (1,979,882 Other income (expense) 34,553 (171,467 Net (loss) (1,187,621 (2,151,349 Net loss per common share - basic and diluted (0.00 (0.01 Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 versus Nine Months ended September 30, 2023 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 0 of revenues. The Company did not generate any revenues due to the continued focus of the Company s capital and resources towards obtaining a Class III PMA. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1,222,174 and 1,979,882, respectively. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease of 462,500 in litigation settlement expenses, a decrease of 132,015 in legal and professional expenses and research and development expenses decreasing 198,393 to 247,157 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 445,550 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other income (expense) Other income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 34,553 and (171,467), respectively. The change in other income (expense) was primarily due to the Company having a 115,085 gain on settlement in the current period and having a loss on settlement of debt of 80,532 in the comparable period from the prior year. Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,187,621 compared to net loss of 2,151,349 for the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease in the net loss was due to the Company having a decrease in operating expenses of 757,708 and a decrease in other expenses of 206,020 as explained above. 21 Table of Contents Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a negative working capital of 2,171,720. The Company has not yet attained a level of operations which will allow it to meet its current overhead expense obligations. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our 2023 financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has been focusing its capital and resources towards seeking a Class III PMA for its CelluSTAT technology, and has funded its initial operations with private placements, and unsecured loans from related parties. There can be no assurance that adequate financing will continue to be available to the Company and, if available, on terms that are favorable to the Company. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on many events outside of our direct control, including, among other things, our ability to achieve our business goals and objectives, as well as improvement in the economic climate. The Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement CSPA with White Lion, which gives the Company the right, but not the obligation, to require White Lion to purchase up to 10,000,000 of the Company s common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the CSPA. As of the date of this filing, the Company has received approximately 3.2 million in proceeds from White Lion to pay for its operations and finalization of its Class III PMA application. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to rising interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs. Cash Flows The Company s cash on hand at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 43,783 and 95,420, respectively. The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (1,013,278 (1,624,145 Net cash used in investing activities - (2,850 Net cash provided by financing activities 961,641 1,687,657 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (51,637 60,662 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,013,278.

The Company paid 2,850 related to a security deposit during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 961,641. This was due to the result of the Company receiving net proceeds of 811,641 from the sale of common stock and 150,000 in proceeds from a note payable. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1,687,657. This was due to the result of the Company receiving net proceeds of 1,710,793 from the sale of stock offset by making payments of 19,136 on a loan payable and 4,000 on a loan payable related party. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have the critical accounting estimates identified below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results which are found in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying financial statements. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation . Stock-based compensation expense for employees and non-employees is measured at the grant date fair value. Stock-based compensation for all stock-based awards to employees and directors is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. 23 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . Not applicable Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company is in the process of implementing disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of September 30, 2024, the Chief Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer carried out an assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our system of internal controls over financial reporting. 24 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings None. Item 1A. Risk Factors Except as set forth below, management does not believe there have been any material changes to the risk factors listed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These risk factors should be carefully considered with the information provided elsewhere in this report, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We can provide no assurances that the FDA will approve our Class III application for internal surgical procedures in the U.S. market for our CelluSTAT product. We are reliant on receiving Premarket Approval (PMA) from the FDA for our CelluSTAT product in order to implement our business strategy of targeting the surgical market. If we do not obtain a PMA for our CelluSTAT product, we will have to materially change our strategy, which we cannot assure we would be successful in doing. We submitted our initial PMA application to the FDA in 2018, during 2022 and 2023, the Company worked to address certain deficiencies in its PMA application that were identified by the FDA in 2021. These deficiencies were largely related to the need for standardized procedures for our manufacturing process, and quality assurance procedures for finished, customer ready products. On March 21, 2024, we submitted results of the human clinical trial and other information, including our manufacturing, sterilization and shipping processes, to the FDA. On June 18, 2024, the FDA issued a customary Deficiencies Letter to the company listing certain questions and comments on various elements of the application. The letter contained approximately 40 specific comments and requests for additional information covering the device description, sterility shelf life, clinical performance testing, and biocompatibility sections of the PMA application. The FDA s 180-day PMA application review period will be paused while the Company develops its responses to the deficiencies that were identified, and will resume once all the responses have been submitted. We cannot be assured that our CelluSTAT product will meet the PMA requirements for FDA approval or that we will ever receive the requisite PMA for our CelluSTAT product. We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and must comply with the regulations of the FDA, as well as state, local and applicable international regulations. Failure to do so could harm our business . Our CelluSTAT products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. These regulations relate to manufacturing, labeling, sale, promotion, distribution and shipping. Before a new medical device, or a new intended use of a legally marketed device, can be marketed in the United States, it must be cleared or approved by the FDA through the applicable 510(k) premarket notification submission, granting of a de novo request, or Premarket Approval (PMA)), unless an exemption applies. The clearance and approval process is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA can result in an enforcement action, which could include a variety of sanctions, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production and criminal prosecution. The FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products or impact our ability to modify our products after clearance on a timely basis. Such policy or regulatory changes could impose additional requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain clearance for our products, increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain products after clearance. 25 Table of Contents The FDA has substantial discretion in the PMA approval process. The FDA can limit or deny approval of a product for many reasons, including, but not limited, to: a product may not be deemed to be safe and effective; the FDA may not find the data from clinical trials and preclinical studies sufficient; the opportunity for bias in the clinical trials as a result of the open-label design may not be adequately handled and may cause our trial to fail; the FDA may not approve suppliers processes or facilities; or the FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations. In addition, regulatory clearance or approval by the FDA does not ensure registration, clearance, approval, or certification by comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Complying with foreign regulatory requirements, including obtaining registrations, clearances, approvals, or certifications, can be expensive and time consuming, and we may not receive regulatory clearances, approvals, or certifications in each country or region in which we plan to market our products or we may be unable to do so on a timely basis. In turn, this could limit our ability to expand into international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds The following summarizes all sales of our unregistered securities from January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024. The securities in the below-referenced transactions were (i) issued without registration and (ii) were subject to restrictions under the Securities Act and the securities laws of certain states, in reliance on the private offering exemptions contained in Sections 4(a)(2), 4(a)(6) and/or 3(b) of the Securities Act and on Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, and in reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws as transactions not involving a public offering. No placement or underwriting fees were paid in connection with these transactions. All cash proceeds from the sale of securities were used for working capital purposes.
