 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations AMREP Corporation (the Company ), through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in two business segments: land development and homebuilding. The Company has no foreign sales or activities outside the United States. Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to the Company in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q include the Company and its subsidiaries. The following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The information contained in this Item 2 should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this report on Form 10-Q and with the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2024, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 23, 2024 (the 2024 Form 10-K ). Many of the amounts and percentages presented in this Item 2 have been rounded for convenience of presentation. Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to 2025 and 2024 are to the fiscal years ending April 30, 2025 and 2024. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the accounting policies used and disclosed in the 2024 condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and included as part of the 2024 Form 10-K. The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report on Form 10-Q required management to make estimates and assumptions that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts or results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. The Company s critical accounting policies, assumptions and estimates are described in Item 7 of Part II of the 2024 Form 10-K. There have been no changes in these critical accounting policies. Information concerning the Company s implementation and the impact of recent accounting standards or updates issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board is included in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in the 2024 Form 10-K and in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report on Form 10-Q.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For the three months ended October 31, 2024, the Company had net income of 4,042,000, or 0.75 per diluted share, compared to net income of 1,108,000, or 0.21 per diluted share, for the three months ended October 31, 2023. For the six months ended October 31, 2024, the Company had net income of 8,106,000, or 1.51 per diluted share, compared to net income of 2,454,000, or 0.46 per diluted share, for the six months ended October 31, 2023. During the six months ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, the Company experienced delays in municipal entitlements, infrastructure availability, approvals and inspections and utility response times in both the land development business segment and homebuilding business segment, which caused delays in construction and the realization of revenues and increases in cost of revenues. The rising cost of housing due to increases in average sales prices in recent years and the level of mortgage interest rates, coupled with general inflation in the U.S. economy and other macroeconomic factors, have placed pressure on overall housing affordability, negatively affecting demand and have caused many potential homebuyers to pause and reconsider their housing choices. Given the affordability challenges and the resulting impact on demand, the Company has provided sales incentives on certain homes, reduced the size of lots and homes, opportunistically leased completed homes and slowed the pace of housing starts and land development projects. During 2024, the Company reduced the number and scope of its active land development projects and delayed proceeding with certain new land development projects due to market headwinds and uncertainty and an increase in entitlement and infrastructure delays as compared to the prior year. This may result in reduced land sale revenues during 2025 and the fiscal year ending April 30, 2026 as compared to 2024. Revenues . The following presents information on revenues (dollars in thousands):

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Finance and Accounting, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. As a result of such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Finance and Accounting have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Finance and Accounting, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No change in the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
