The Company s investment is considered a significant variable interest, but it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance.

The Company s maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amount of its investment and accounted for under the equity method which is presented within Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Losses may occur as a result of a reduction of projected cash flows from the VIE s loan portfolio based on expected claim settlements. The Company recognized an equity method loss of approximately thousand on its investment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the investment s carrying amount was million with a remaining life of years. As of December 31, 2023, the investment s carrying amount was million.

 The Company has made no significant judgments in applying the revenue guidance prescribed in ASC 606 that affect the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from the above-described contracts with customers. Payment processing income We provide payment processing services as an acquiring bank through the third-party or independent sales organization ISO business model in which we process credit and debit card transactions on behalf of merchants. We enter into a tri-party merchant agreement, between the Company, ISO and each merchant. The Company s performance obligation is clearing and settling credit and debit transactions on behalf of the merchants. The Company recognizes revenue monthly once it summarizes and computes all revenue and expenses applicable to each ISO, which is our performance obligation. ACH income We provide ACH services for merchants and other commercial customers. Contracts are entered into with third parties that require ACH transactions processed on behalf of their customers. Fees are variable and based on the volume of transactions within a given month. Our performance obligations are processing and settling ACHs on behalf of the customers. Our obligation is satisfied within each business day when the transactions (ACH files) are sent to the FRB for clearing. Revenue is recognized based on the total volume of transactions processed that month for a given customer. Administrative service income Administrative service income is derived primarily from the management of qualified settlement funds QSFs ), which are funds from settled mass torts and class action lawsuits. Our performance obligations with the QSFs are outlined in court approved orders which includes ensuring funds are invested into safe investment vehicles such as U.S. treasuries and FDIC insured products. Our fees for placing these funds in appropriate vehicles are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which the Company satisfies the performance obligation.

 and have contractual terms. All options provide for accelerated vesting upon a change in control (as defined in the plans). Restricted shares are granted at the fair value on the date of grant and typically vest over with a third vesting after years four, five, and six. Restricted shares have the same voting rights as common stock and nonvested restricted shareholders do not have rights to the accrued dividends until vested. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form option valuation (Black-Scholes) model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatilities are based on peer volatility. The Company uses peer data to estimate option exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected term of options granted is based on peer data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes into account that the options are not transferable. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. There were stock options granted during the three and nine months ended September 0, 2024 and 2023. The following table presents a summary of the activity related to options for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: Granted Exercised ) Forfeited ) Expired Outstanding at period end Vested or expected to vest Exercisable at period end The Company recognized compensation expense related to options of thousand and thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements that are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what we anticipate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Critical Accounting Estimates A summary of our significant accounting policies is described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our annual report. Critical accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policies, which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments, are as follows: Allowance for Credit Losses. Management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for credit losses to be a critical accounting policy given the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in estimating the levels of the allowance required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations . See Note 1 Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our annual report for discussion of our allowance for credit losses policy. On January 1, 2023, we adopted the CECL Standard. The Company is required under the CECL Standard to estimate and record lifetime credit losses expected to be incurred on such financial instruments over the entire contractual term at the time they are recorded in the financial statements, such as with the funding or purchasing of a loan, or a commitment to lend unless the commitment is unconditionally cancellable. Because this allowance methodology follows a forward-looking lifetime expected loss approach, it is not necessary for a loss event to have been incurred before a credit loss is recognized. The estimation process in determining an appropriate level for the allowance for credit losses requires 

 26 

Table of Contents 
 consideration of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, and involves a significant degree of management judgment. The Company determines the allowance for credit losses using methods it believes are appropriate given the characteristics of each loan portfolio and applies these methods consistently over time. The Company employs a static pool methodology for all loan segments. In a static pool approach, statistical information about a pool of loans originated during a specified period is tracked over its life (including losses, delinquencies, and prepayments). In general, this methodology operates by calculating a rate representing the current balance expected to not be collected for each pool. This loss rate is then applied against the current portfolio loans with similar characteristics of those established in the pool. In accordance with the CECL Standard, the Company must estimate expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. In estimating the life of a loan, the Company cannot extend the contractual term of a loan for expected extensions, renewals, and modifications, unless there is a borrower-held extension or renewal option that is not unconditionally cancelable. In developing the estimate of expected credit losses, the Company must reflect information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This information should include what is reasonably available without undue cost and effort and may include information sourced internally, externally, or a combination of both. The estimation of expected credit losses requires the use of forward-looking information that is both reasonable and supportable, including information that relates to economic forecasts and how those forecasts are expected to impact expected future losses. The Company incorporates reasonable and supportable forecasts as qualitative adjustments applied to the historical loss rates over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The CECL Standard does not require a specific method for developing economic forecasts, nor does it require a specific timeframe over which a reasonable and supportable forecast should be employed in the Company s CECL model. While the Company is not precluded from utilizing economic forecasts over the entire contractual term of a loan, the Company utilizes forecasts it believes are reasonable and supportable. The Company considers its methodologies to determine reasonable and supportable forecasts and reversion techniques to be accounting estimates rather than accounting policies or principles. For periods beyond which the Company is unable to determine a reasonable and supportable forecast, it will revert to unadjusted historical loss information in accordance with the CECL Standard. Management assesses the sensitivity of key assumptions by stressing the quantitative inputs utilized in its economic forecasts. This sensitivity analysis provides management with a hypothetical result to assess the sensitivity of our allowance for credit losses to a change in a key quantitative input. Qualitative factors are used to supplement the static pool methodology to determine total estimated expected credit losses during a given period. Because the static pool methodology estimates losses based on historical loss information, management utilizes qualitative factors to measure expected credit losses which are not sufficiently captured within the static pool model during a given period. On a quarterly basis, management determines the extent to which qualitative factors are used to bring the allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate. These adjustments to the allowance for credit losses may be positive or negative to the quantitatively modeled results from the static pool methodology. Final qualitative adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are subject to management judgment. The Company measures the allowance for credit losses on a collective basis by pooling loans according to similar risk characteristics. When a loan is deemed to no longer share risk characteristics similar to others in the portfolio, the Company evaluates such loans on an individual basis. Management may consider changes to a borrower s circumstances impacting cash collections, delinquency and non-accrual status, probability of default, industry, or other facts and circumstances when determining whether a loan shares risk characteristics with other loans in a pool. For a loan that does not share risk characteristics with other loans in a pool and is not collateral dependent, expected credit loss is measured based on the discounted value of the expected future cash flows and the amortized cost of the loan. If an entity determines that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, the CECL Standard requires the entity to measure expected credit losses of collateral dependent loans based on the difference between the current fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was one multifamily loan totaling 10.9 million that was individually analyzed, collateral dependent and had no specific reserve on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

 When applying this critical accounting estimate, management s inputs and estimates of the timing and amounts of future losses are subject to significant judgment as these projected cash flows rely upon factors that depend on current or expected future conditions. Management expects there to be differences between actual and estimated results. Future changes to the allowance for credit losses may be necessary based on changes in economic, market, or other conditions. Changes to estimates could result in a material change in the allowance for credit losses and charges to provision for credit losses would materially decrease the Company s net income. The Company s loan portfolio may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Overview We are a financial holding company headquartered in Jericho, New York and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, Esquire Bank, National Association Esquire Bank or the Bank ), we are a full service commercial bank dedicated to serving the financial needs of the legal and small business communities on a national basis, as well as commercial and retail customers in the New York metropolitan market. We offer tailored products and solutions to the legal community and their clients as well as dynamic and flexible payment processing solutions to small business owners, both on a national basis. We also offer traditional banking products for businesses and consumers in our local market area. Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for credit losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income currently consists primarily of payment processing income, administrative service payment fee income and customer related fees and charges. Noninterest expense currently consists primarily of employee compensation and benefits, data processing costs, occupancy and equipment costs and professional and consulting services. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies, the litigation market and actions of regulatory authorities. The Company s foundation for success has been our nationwide branchless litigation and payment processing verticals supported by our forward-thinking senior managers, outstanding client service teams, and inclusive corporate culture. The future of our success will be the ability to continue developing and embracing cutting-edge technology to significantly leverage these verticals, differentiating us from other technology enabled financial firms and creating the catalyst for industry leading growth and returns. Litigation Market Commercial Banking. The litigation market has been and will continue to be a significant growth opportunity for our Company as we offer focused and tailored products and services to law firms nationally. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Institute for Legal Reform Tort Costs in America An Empirical Analysis of Costs and Compensation of U.S. Tort System ), published in November 2022, U.S. tort actions alone are estimated to consume approximately 2.1 of U.S. GDP annually, with a total addressable market TAM of 443 billion for 2020. We do not compete directly with non-bank finance companies, the primary funders in this market, and believe there are various and significant barriers to entry including, but not limited to, our clear industry track record for decades, extensive in-house experience, deep relationships with respected firms nationally, and unique products tailored to commercial law firms needs and wants. We currently have lending clients in 30 states and our larger markets include the New York metro area, California, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and New Jersey. Our success is tied to our unique ability to couple traditional commercial underwriting with non-traditional asset-based underwriting. Our team understands law firms contingent case inventory valuation process (as well as traditional hourly billing firms). Typically, these inventories of claims for injured consumers or claimants have a duration of 2-3 years, significantly longer than traditional accounts receivables or inventories of goods that can have a duration of 30-60 days or 120 days, respectively. These factors (the unique industry, contingent collateral, longer durations of the law firms inventories, atypical revenue streams of the law firms and more) coupled with the TAM create a unique and valuable opportunity for the Company with minimal incumbent competition. This unique risk profile translates approximately into a blended 10 variable rate asset yield on these commercial loans for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. More importantly, since our commercial banking platform is focused on full

Table of Contents 
 service relationship banking, for every 1.00 we advance on these loans we receive on average 1.52 of low-cost (our cost-of-funds for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 is 88 basis points) core operating and escrow deposits from these law firms through our branchless platform, fueling and funding additional growth in our other asset classes. Our extremely low historic delinquency rates and low charge-off rates clearly demonstrate our strong underwriting process and expertise in this vertical. Our longer duration escrow or claimant trust settlement deposits represent accounts where the law firm is trustee for the claimant settlement funds and represent 828.9 million, or 54 , of total deposits. These law firm escrow accounts as well as other fiduciary deposit accounts are for the benefit of the law firm s customers (or claimants) and are titled in a manner to ensure that the maximum amount of FDIC insurance coverage passes through the account to the beneficial owner of the funds held in the account. Therefore, these law firm escrow accounts carry FDIC insurance at the claimant settlement level, not at the deposit account level. Coupling these types of commercial relationships with our off-balance sheet commercial litigation funds of 488.0 million at September 30, 2024, makes this litigation vertical a highly desirable core low-cost funding platform fueling growth in other lending areas. Other Commercial Banking. In addition to our Litigation Commercial Banking business, commercial loans are also originated to local small to mid-size businesses to provide short-term financing for inventory, receivables, the purchase of supplies, or other operating needs arising during the normal course of business and loans made to our qualified ISO payment processing customers. The balance of these loans totaled 97.7 million at September 30, 2024 and represented approximately 7.5 of our total loans. Payment Processing. The payment processing (merchant acquiring) market has also been and will continue to be a significant growth opportunity for our company, as we offer focused and tailored products and services to small businesses nationally. The payment industry grew approximately 10 on a compound annual growth rate from 2019 to 2023 with payment volumes or TAM of 10.9 trillion according to company records on U.S. payment industry trends. Couple this with the fact that there are less than approximately 100 acquiring financial institutions in the U.S. and this vertical clearly represents a significant growth opportunity for our Company. We believe there are various and significant barriers to entry to this market including, but not limited to, our clear industry track record for decades, extensive in-house experience, deep relationships with non-bank acquirers, and our unique approach to servicing these small business merchants and their respective verticals. We use proprietary and industry leading technology to ensure card brand and regulatory compliance, support multiple processing platforms, manage daily risk across approximately 84,000 small business merchants in all 50 states, and perform commercial treasury clearing services for approximately 9 billion in credit and debit card processing volume across 152 million transactions in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Proprietary Technology. We are currently a branchless digital first company with best-in-class technology to fuel future growth with industry leading client retention rates. We have built a customized and fully integrated customer relationship management CRM platform, integrated into our digital marketing cloud and our nCino loan platform (all built on Salesforce for excellence in client service and operational efficiency) and invest in artificial intelligence AI to facilitate precision marketing and client acquisition across both national verticals with an initial focus on the litigation vertical. The success of our national litigation and payment processing verticals coupled with our branchless technology has led to industry leading performance. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we have produced industry leading returns including, but not limited to, a return on average assets and average equity of 2.62 and 20.29 , respectively; an industry leading net interest margin of 6.16 ; a strong efficiency ratio of 48.1 ; and a diversified revenue stream as demonstrated by a strong net interest margin and stable fee income representing 19 of total revenue (our payment processing vertical has a compound annual growth rate of 19 since 2019). Coupling these performance metrics with strong balance sheet management including, but not limited to, loan portfolio diversification, an asset sensitive balance sheet with 64 of our loans being variable rate tied to prime, interest rate floors in place on 83 of our variable rate loan portfolio, solid credit metrics with limited nonperforming assets, a stable low cost deposit base, and strong available liquidity of 972.4 million, or 63 of deposits, with no outstanding borrowings ensures that our Company is poised for future growth and success.

 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 Assets. Our total assets were 1.78 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 165.6 million, or 10.2 , from 1.62 billion at December 31, 2023, due to growth in loans held for investment of 90.0 million, or 7.5 , and securities available-for-sale of 89.4 million, or 73.2 , partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 17.5 million, or 10.6 , as we deployed our strong liquidity into higher yielding commercial loans and agency securities. Loan Portfolio Analysis. At September 30, 2024, loans, net of deferred fees and unearned premiums, were 1.30 billion, or 84.4 of total deposits, compared to 1.21 billion, or 85.8 of total deposits, at December 31, 2023. The growth in loans was primarily driven by net production in commercial loans, and to a lesser extent, consumer loans. Commercial loans increased 87.5 million, or 11.9 , to 825.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 737.9 million at December 31, 2023, driven by our litigation related loans. Consumer loans increased 4.4 million, or 30.2 , to 18.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 14.5 million at December 31, 2023. Loan Portfolio Composition.

 614.9 million, or 50.9 of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2023. We remain focused on prudently growing our Litigation-Related loan portfolio as our regional Business Development Officers BDOs and related support staff continue to drive growth across our national commercial platform. We also had Commercial Litigation-Related committed and uncommitted undrawn lines of credit totaling 91.1 million and 577.3 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024. Debt Securities Portfolio. Securities available-for-sale increased 89.4 million, or 73.2 , to 211.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 122.1 million at December 31, 2023, due to our current balance sheet management strategy of deploying funds in short duration agency mortgage-backed securities at peak market interest rates, while simultaneously moderating multifamily and commercial real estate CRE growth due to the current economic and interest rate environment. The increase was driven by purchases of 102.7 million, and unrealized gains of 4.0 million, partially offset by paydowns of 17.2 million. Securities held-to-maturity decreased 6.2 million, or 8.1 , to 70.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 77.0 million at December 31, 2023, driven by paydowns of 6.1 million and net premium amortization of 77 thousand. Funding . Total deposits increased 129.1 million, or 9.2 , to 1.54 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.41 billion at December 31, 2023. We continue to focus on the acquisition and expansion of core deposit relationships. Core deposits, which we define as total deposits excluding time deposits, totaled 1.52 billion at September 30, 2024, or 99.1 of total deposits, compared to 1.40 billion or 99.4 of total deposits at December 31, 2023. Litigation and payment processing deposits represent 1.27 billion, or 82.9 , of total deposits at September 30, 2024. Savings, NOW and money market deposits increased 56.6 million, or 6.1 , to 982.8 million at September 30, 2024. Core commercial relationship banking clients in our two national verticals represent approximately 80 of our 1.54 billion deposit base at September 30, 2024. These relationship banking clients are derived from coupling lending facilities, payment processing, and other unique custodial banking needs with commercial cash management depository services. Our deposit strategy primarily focuses on developing full service commercial banking relationships with our clients through lending facilities, payment processing, and other unique commercial cash management services in our two national verticals, rather than competing with other institutions on rate. Our longer duration interest on lawyer trust accounts IOLTA ), escrow and claimant trust settlement deposits represent 828.9 million, or 54.0 , of total deposits. As of September 30, 2024, uninsured deposits were 458.9 million, or 30 , of our total deposits of 1.54 billion, excluding 10.6 million of affiliate deposits held by the Bank. Approximately 80 of our uninsured deposits represent clients with full relationship banking (loans, payment processing, and other service-oriented relationships) including, but not limited to, law firm operating accounts, law firm IOLTA/escrow accounts, merchant reserves, ISO reserves, ACH processing, and custodial accounts. Due to the nature of our larger mass tort and class action settlements related to the litigation vertical, we participate in FDIC insured sweep programs as well as treasury secured money market funds. As of September 30, 2024, off-balance sheet sweep funds totaled approximately 488.0 million, of which approximately 356.5 million, or 73.1 , was available to be swept onto our balance sheet as reciprocal client relationship deposits. Our deposit growth and off-balance sheet funds continue to demonstrate our highly efficient branchless and technology enabled deposit platforms. At September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow a total of 395.8 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. We also had an available line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York discount window of 54.9 million. No borrowing amounts were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Historically, we have never leveraged our balance sheet to generate earnings and have always utilized core client deposits to fund our asset growth and related earnings. Stockholders Equity. Total stockholders equity increased 34.0 million to 232.6 million at September 30, 2024, from 198.6 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to net income of 31.9 million and decreases in other comprehensive losses of 2.9 million, as unrealized losses on our securities available-for-sale declined due to current short-term market interest rates, and amortization of share-based compensation of 2.9 million, partially offset by dividends declared to common stockholders of 3.7 million. Asset Quality. Nonperforming assets consisted of one multifamily loan totaling 10.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We had no exposure to commercial office space, no construction loans, and 14.8

 million in performing loans to the hospitality industry. The allowance for credit losses was 19.5 million, or 1.50 of total loans, as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 16.6 million, or 1.38 of total loans at December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance as a percentage of loans was general reserve driven considering loan growth and qualitative factors associated with the current short-term interest rate environment as well as the current uncertain economic environment including, but not limited to, its potential impact on the New York Metro multifamily and commercial real estate market. At September 30, 2024, special mention and substandard loans totaled 4.0 million and 10.9 million, respectively, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2023. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans and total assets was 0.84 and 0.61 , respectively, as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.91 and 0.68 , respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses to the nonperforming loans was 178 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 152 as of December 31, 2023. Due to the interest rate environment since 2022, management enhanced its ongoing credit risk management monitoring and testing of its commercial real estate loan portfolio. The following is a brief summary of our risk management results for our multifamily and CRE portfolios as of September 30, 2024: The multifamily portfolio, excluding one nonperforming loan, totaling 339.9 million, has a current weighted average DSCR and an original LTV (defined as unpaid principal balance as of September 30, 2024 divided by appraised value at origination) of approximately 1.67 and 54 , respectively, and the CRE portfolio, totaling 87.5 million, has a current weighted average DSCR and an original LTV of approximately 1.51 and 59 , respectively. Multifamily loans maturing in less than one year totaled 59.8 million and had a current weighted average DSCR and an original LTV of approximately 1.37 and 57 , respectively. CRE loans maturing in less than one year totaled 1.8 million and had a current weighted average DSCR and an original LTV of approximately 3.54 and 48 , respectively. Multifamily loans maturing in one to two years totaled 39.0 million and had a current weighted average DSCR and an original LTV of approximately 1.36 and 66 , respectively. CRE loans maturing in one to two years totaled 5.6 million and had a current weighted average DSCR and an original LTV of approximately 1.46 and 59 , respectively.

 The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. The table distinguishes between: (1) changes attributable to volume (changes in volume multiplied by the prior period s rate); (2) changes attributable to rate (change in rate multiplied by the prior year s volume); and (3) total increase (decrease) (the sum of the previous columns). Changes attributable to both volume and rate are allocated ratably between the volume and rate categories.

Net income increased 1.5 million, or 15.5 , to 11.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted from a 4.1 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by an increase of 1.6 million in noninterest expense and a decrease of 466 thousand in noninterest income. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 4.1 million, or 19.0 , to 25.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 21.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to a 5.2 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a 1.1 million increase in interest expense. Our net interest margin decreased 3 basis points, and was negatively impacted by an 18 basis point increase in our cost-of-funds, partially offset by growth in higher yielding variable rate commercial loans and low-cost escrow or IOLTA deposits, to 6.16 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.19 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest Income. Interest income increased 5.2 million, or 21.9 , to 29.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 23.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and was attributable to increases in loan, securities and interest earning cash and other interest income, and partially offset by a decrease in reverse repurchase interest income.

 Loan interest income increased 3.7 million, or 17.3 , to 25.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 21.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was attributable to a 180.4 million, or 16.5 , increase in the average loan balance primarily due to growth in our higher yielding national commercial lending platform and, to a lesser extent, our regional multifamily loan portfolio during the latter part of 2023, and an 8 basis point increase in loan yields to 7.87 . Our commercial loan platform drove a 3.3 million increase in interest income, of which, 3.6 million was due to increased volume, offset slightly by a 275 thousand decrease due to yields decreasing 17 basis points. Commercial loans had a portfolio yield of 9.72 . Additionally, our multifamily platform contributed 561 thousand to the increase in interest income, of which, 337 thousand was due to increased volume and 224 thousand was due to a 27 basis point increase in yields, driving a portfolio yield of 4.33 . Securities interest income increased 1.2 million, or 93.0 , to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to our current balance sheet management strategy of deploying funds in short duration agency mortgage-backed securities at peak market interest rates, while simultaneously moderating multifamily and CRE growth due to the current economic and interest rate environment. Average securities increased 71.9 million, or 34.6 , and yields increased 104 basis points to 3.40 . Interest earning cash interest income increased 523 thousand to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, attributable to a 21 basis point increase in yields which was positively impacted by increases in short-term interest rates, and a 35.7 million, or 42.2 , increase in the average balance of interest earning cash. Securities purchased under agreements to resell interest income decreased 158 thousand as management elected to close out its reverse repurchase agreements and reinvest funds into higher yielding commercial loans. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 1.1 million, or 50.4 , to 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to increases in average rate (primarily IOLTA) comprising 681 thousand and an increase of 460 thousand (primarily IOLTA) attributable to average deposit balances. Average interest bearing deposit balances (primarily IOLTA) increased 211.9 million, or 28.6 , when compared to September 30, 2023. Our deposit cost-of-funds, excluding demand deposits, increased 21 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to increases in short-term interest rates as well as management proactively increasing rates on IOLTA accounts in the various states we operate. Provision for Credit Losses. Our provision for credit losses was 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 200 thousand from the 1.2 million provision for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our allowance to loans ratio was 1.50 as compared to 1.38 as of September 30, 2023. The increase in the allowance as a percentage of loans was general reserve driven considering loan growth and qualitative factors associated with the current short-term interest rate environment as well as the current uncertain economic environment including, but not limited to, its potential impact on the New York Metro multifamily and commercial real estate market.

 Payment processing volumes and transactions for the credit and debit card processing platform increased 2.6 billion, or 10.6 , to 27.1 billion and 1.0 million, or 0.2 , to 458.1 million transactions, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. These increases were due to the expansion of sales channels through ISOs, an increased number of merchants, volume increases, and were facilitated by our focus on technology and other resources in the payments vertical. Administrative service income increased 137 thousand, or 7.3 , to 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Off-balance sheet sweep funds totaled 488.0 million at September 30, 2024, demonstrating the continued strength of our branchless core business model. Other income increased 228 thousand, or 33.2 , to 915 thousand primarily due to loan and other banking related fees. Net gain on equity investments decreased 4.0 million due to a nonrecurring gain on our Litify fintech investment in the first quarter of 2023. In February 2023, Litify, Inc. Litify was reorganized into a partnership and an unrelated third party acquired a majority ownership in the reorganized entity. As an equity holder and party to the reorganization and sale transaction, a majority of the Company s partnership interests were exchanged for cash and undiscounted noncash consideration of approximately 5.4 million. As a result, the Company recognized a gain on its investment of 4.0 million in the first quarter of 2023. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company received cash consideration resulting in a realized gain on its Litify investment of approximately 500 thousand, offset by an equity method loss of approximately 500 thousand recognized on its investment in a third party sponsored NFL consumer post settlement loan fund.

 Management of Market Risk General. The principal objective of our asset and liability management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk within the balance sheet and pursue a controlled assumption of interest rate risk while maximizing net income and preserving adequate levels of liquidity and capital. The board of directors of our bank has oversight of our asset and liability management function, which is managed by our Asset/Liability Management Committee. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to market interest rate changes, local and national market conditions and market interest rates. That group also reviews our liquidity, capital, deposit mix, loan mix and investment positions. As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the fair value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short-term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income. We manage our exposure to interest rates primarily by structuring our balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. We do not typically enter into derivative contracts for the purpose of managing interest rate risk, but we may do so in the future. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. We do not own any trading assets. Net Interest Income Simulation. We use an interest rate risk simulation model to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet. Instantaneous parallel rate shift scenarios are modeled and utilized to evaluate risk and establish exposure limits for acceptable changes in net interest margin. These scenarios, known as rate shocks, simulate an instantaneous change in interest rates and use various assumptions, including, but not limited to, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability cash flows. The following table presents the estimated changes in net interest income of Esquire Bank, National Association, calculated on a bank-only basis, which would result from changes in market interest rates over a twelve-month period. 

September 30, 2024 Estimated Changes in 12-Months Interest Rates Net Interest (Basis Points) Income Change (Dollars in thousands) 300 128,851 17,697 200 122,843 11,689 100 116,740 5,586 0 111,154 -100 106,134 (5,020) -200 100,384 (10,770) -300 94,426 (16,728) Economic Value of Equity Simulation. We also analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through an economic value of equity EVE model. EVE represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet contracts. EVE attempts to quantify our economic value using a discounted cash flow methodology. We estimate what our EVE would be as of a specific date. We then calculate what EVE would be as of the same date throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve.

 The following table presents the estimated changes in EVE of Esquire Bank, National Association, calculated on a bank-only basis that would result from changes in market interest rates at September 30, 2024. 

September 30, 2024 Changes in Economic Interest Rates Value of (Basis Points) Equity Change (Dollars in thousands) 300 408,006 58,334 200 392,080 42,408 100 373,285 23,613 0 349,672 -100 321,321 (28,351) -200 287,009 (62,663) -300 246,173 (103,499) Many assumptions are used to calculate the impact of interest rate fluctuations. Actual results may be significantly different than our projections due to several factors, including the timing and frequency of rate changes, market conditions and the shape of the yield curve. The computations of interest rate risk shown above do not include actions that our management may undertake to manage the risks in response to anticipated changes in interest rates, and actual results may also differ due to any actions taken in response to the changing rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments and maturities and sales of securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. We regularly review the need to adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest earning deposits and securities, and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning deposits and short- and intermediate-term securities. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 147.7 million. At September 30, 2024, through pledging of our securities and certain loans, we had the ability to borrow up to 395.8 million from the FHLB of New York and 54.9 million from the FRB of New York discount window. At September 30, 2024, we also had 17.5 million in aggregated unsecured lines of credit with unaffiliated correspondent banks. No amounts were outstanding on any of the aforementioned lines as of September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, our off-balance sheet sweeps funds totaled 488.0 million, of which 356.5 million, or 73.1 , was able to be swept onto our balance sheet as reciprocal client relationship deposits. Our overall liquidity position (cash, borrowing capacity, and available reciprocal client sweep balances) totaled 972.4 million at September 30, 2024, or 63 of total deposits, creating a highly liquid and unlevered balance sheet. We have no material commitments or demands that are likely to affect our liquidity other than set forth below. In the event loan demand were to increase faster than expected, or any unforeseen demand or commitment were to occur, we could access our borrowing capacity with the FHLB, FRB, other correspondent bank lines or obtain additional funds through reciprocal deposits.

 Esquire Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC ), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At September 30, 2024, Esquire Bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and was considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. We manage our capital to comply with our internal planning targets and regulatory capital standards administered by the OCC and review capital levels on a monthly basis. The following table presents our capital ratios as of the indicated dates for Esquire Bank. 

For Capital Adequacy Purposes Minimum Capital with Actual Well Capitalized Conservation Buffer At September 30, 2024 Total Risk-based Capital Ratio Bank 10.00 10.50 16.64 Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio Bank 8.00 8.50 15.39 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio Bank 6.50 7.00 15.39 Tier 1 Leverage Ratio Bank 5.00 4.00 12.60 Effective January 1, 2020, the federal banking agencies adopted a rule to establish for institutions with assets of less than 10 billion that meet other specified criteria a community bank leverage ratio (the ratio of a bank s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) of 9 that such institutions may elect to utilize in lieu of the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements noted above. A qualifying community bank with capital exceeding 9 will be considered compliant with all applicable regulatory capital and leverage requirements, including the requirement to be well capitalized . For the current period, the Bank has elected to continue to utilize the generally applicable leverage and risk based requirements and not apply the community bank leverage ratio. Effects of Inflation. The impact of inflation, as it affects banks, differs substantially from the impact on non-financial institutions. Banks have assets which are primarily monetary in nature and which tend to move with inflation. This is especially true for banks with a high percentage of rate sensitive interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. A bank can further reduce the impact of inflation with proper management of its rate sensitivity gap. This gap represents the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities. The Company attempts to structure its assets and liabilities and manages its gap to protect against substantial changes in interest rate scenarios, in order to minimize the potential effects of inflation.
