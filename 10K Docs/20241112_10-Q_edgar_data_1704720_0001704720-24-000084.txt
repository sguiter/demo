million shares of common stock of Dayforce, Inc., ("Dayforce", formerly known as Ceridian HCM Holding, Inc.) for gross proceeds of million and as of September 30, 2024, we no longer have any holdings of Dayforce. 
 Refer to Note B - Investments and Note C - Fair Value Measurements for further discussion of our accounting for our ownership interest in Dayforce and other equity securities. 
 Dun Bradstreet 
 On February 8, 2024, April 30, 2024 and July 24, 2024, the board of directors of D B declared quarterly cash dividends of per share of D B common stock. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received million of cash dividends from D B which are recorded as a reduction to the basis of our recorded asset for D B. 
 In March 2024, we completed the sale of million shares of common stock of D B. In connection with the sale, we received proceeds of million. As of September 30, 2024, we owned million shares of D B, which represented approximately of its outstanding common stock. 
 See Note B - Investments for further discussion of our accounting for our ownership interest in D B and other equity method investments. 
 Paysafe 
 In January 2024, we purchased million shares of Paysafe for million. As of September 30, 2024, we hold a ownership interest in Paysafe. 
 Other Developments 
 
 million of shares of our common stock at a purchase price of not less than per share and not greater than per share (the "Tender Offer"). We conducted the Tender Offer through a procedure commonly referred to as a "modified Dutch auction." This procedure allows shareholders to select the price within a price range specified by us at which the shareholders are willing to sell their shares. 
 On April 1, 2024, the Tender Offer expired and the Company accepted for purchase an aggregate of shares of its common stock that were properly tendered and not properly withdrawn at or below a purchase price of per share for an aggregate cost of million, excluding fees and expenses. Included in the shares of Cannae common stock we accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer are shares that Cannae elected to purchase pursuant to its right to purchase up to an additional of its outstanding common stock. 
 On February 21, 2024, we issued million shares of common stock of the Company from the Company s treasury and paid million in cash, in the aggregate, to certain partners of JANA in exchange for a equity interest in JANA. The transaction is valued at million based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on February 21, 2024. Cannae also committed to invest million into JANA funds (the "JANA Fund Commitment"). JANA is an investment manager founded in 2001. We account for our ownership interest in JANA as an unconsolidated affiliate using the equity method of accounting and record our ratable share of JANA's net income or loss on a three-month lag. 
 On February 26, 2024, the Company, Cannae LLC and Trasimene entered into a Third Amended and Restated Management Services Agreement (the "Third Amended MSA"). The Third Amended MSA amends the management services agreement primarily to (i) provide for a termination of the agreement by the Company effective June 30, 2027, (ii) reduce the management fee to a fixed amount of million annually effective beginning July 2, 2024 and (iii) provide for payment of the termination fee under the agreement of million to be paid by the Company to Trasimene in installments of million annually over the period ended July 1, 2026. The Third Amended MSA has a termination date of June 30, 2027 unless earlier terminated by the Company or Trasimene. 
 On October 17, 2024, the Company invested approximately million for a ownership interest in Watkins Holdings, LLC ("Watkins Holdings"), a partnership with KDSA Investment Partners ("KDSA") and Mark Jacobs (the "Watkins Acquisition"). Watkins Holdings concurrently completed the acquisition of The Watkins Company ("Watkins"), a leading producer of high-quality flavoring products. Watkins was founded in 1868 and has grown to be a leading domestic producer of spices, seasonings and extracts. The former majority owner of Watkins, Mark Jacobs, rolled a significant equity stake into Watkins Holdings. 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024 through the date of this Quarterly Report, we have invested million in BKFC.

 million and million, respectively, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 we incurred million and million, respectively, of termination fee expenses with our Manager. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred management fee expenses with our Manager of million and million, respectively. These expenses are recorded in Other operating expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, shares of restricted stock outstanding were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as inclusion of restricted stock would be antidilutive due to net losses. 
 Income Taxes 
 Our effective tax rate was ) and in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and ) and in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period was primarily attributable to the varying impact of equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates on income tax expense (benefit). The change in the effective tax rate in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period was primarily attributable to recording of a valuation allowance in the current period of million on our federal net operating loss carryforwards and certain deferred taxes related to our consolidated partnerships, the varying impact of equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates on income tax expense (benefit), and the impairment recorded to our investment in Sightline. 
 We have a Deferred tax asset of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The million change in deferred taxes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to recording of a valuation allowance of million primarily related to our federal net operating loss carryforwards and certain deferred taxes related to our consolidated partnerships, partially offset by the tax impact of sales of Dayforce and impairment of Sightline. 
 million restricted stock units ("RSUs") with a grant date fair value of million as compensation to certain employees of the Company and issued million shares of the Company's common stock to rabbi trusts that grant the holders of the RSUs pass-through voting rights. The RSUs vest in varying increments over a period and, upon vesting, a number of shares of Company common stock equivalent to the number of vested RSUs will be released from the rabbi trusts to the employee. If the RSUs do not vest, the shares held in the rabbi trusts return to the Company. The Company is the primary beneficiary of the rabbi trusts prior to vesting of the RSUs and accordingly the shares of Company common stock held by the rabbi trusts are treated as treasury stock in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet and statement of equity in the period nine-month period ended September 30, 2024.

 million. Based on a valuation using a hybrid discounted cash flow and market comparison approach and adjusted for the risk of a capital shortfall at the business, the aggregate fair market value of our ownership of Sightline equity was approximately million as of June 30, 2024. The fair value measurement is considered a level 3 fair value measure. The primary inputs in the valuation were the forecasted results of operations of Sightline, the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis and the adjustment for risk of capital shortfall. The primary significant unobservable input used was the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis and the adjustment for the risk of capital shortfall. 
 Due to the quantum of the decrease in the fair market value of our ownership interest subsequent to our acquisition, declines in the forecasted results of operations and liquidity of Sightline, and the uncertainty of the ability of Sightline to raise new capital, management determined the decrease in value of our investment in Sightline was other-than-temporary as of June 30, 2024. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment of million which is included in Recognized (losses) gains, net, on our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held variable interests in certain unconsolidated affiliates, which are primarily comprised of our ownership interests in BKFC, CSI and Minden Mill. Cannae does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these unconsolidated affiliates; therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary. 
 The principal risk to which these investments and funds are exposed is the credit risk of the underlying investees. Cannae has guaranteed certain payment obligations of BKFC related to investment commitments associated with its acquisitions of interests in football clubs. These BKFC obligations total an estimated amount between million and million as of September 30, 2024. These obligations are potentially payable at various increments over the next and vary based on certain performance criteria. The underlying obligation of BKFC to fund these amounts is contingent on the exercise of certain investment options by BKFC or other parties. Cannae is required to fund such payments solely to the extent BKFC is unable to meet these obligations. We do not provide any other implicit or explicit liquidity guarantees or principal value guarantees to these VIEs.

Our chief operating decision maker reviews the financial results of Alight for purposes of assessing performance and allocating resources. Thus, we consider Alight a reportable segment and have included the full results of Alight subsequent to our initial acquisition of an ownership interest in the tables above. We account for Alight using the equity method of accounting, and therefore, its results do not consolidate into ours. Accordingly, we have presented the elimination of Alight's results in the Affiliate Elimination section of the segment presentation above. 
 Black Knight Football. This segment consists of our ownership interest in BKFC. Black Knight Football is a partnership led by Bill Foley that owns and operates A.F.C. Bournemouth ("AFCB"), an English Premier League ("EPL" or the "Premier League") football club founded in 1899, a minority interest in FC Lorient ("FCL"), a French Ligue 1 football club founded in 1926, and a minority ownership interest in the Hibernian Football Club Limited, a Scottish Premiership football club founded in 1875. Black Knight Football aims to grow into a leading, multi-club operator of football assets across the world. We account for our ownership of BKFC using the equity method of accounting; therefore, its results of operations do not consolidate into ours. Accordingly, we have presented the elimination of BKFC's results in the Affiliate Elimination section of the segment presentation above. We report our equity in earnings or loss of BKFC on a three-month lag and we acquired our initial interest in BKFC on December 13, 2022. Accordingly, the segment tables above for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include our equity in Black Knight Football s losses and complete results of Black Knight Football for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, and the segment tables for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes our equity in Black Knight Football and complete results of Black Knight Football for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and the period from December 13, 2022 (the date we acquired our initial interest in BKFC) through June 30, 2023, respectively.

On August 17, 2023, the 2020 Margin Facility was amended to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity of the agreement to August 17, 2026, (ii) add million shares of common stock of Alight to the pool of collateral, (iii) change the spread from to basis points and (iv) add Cannae Funding A, LLC ("Borrower 3" and together with Borrower 1 and Borrower 2, the "Borrowers"), an indirect wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of the Company. On March 4, 2024, the 2020 Margin Facility was amended primarily to (i) assign the facility from Royal Bank of Canada to Bank of America, (ii) extend the maturity date to March 4, 2027 and (iii) change the spread from to basis points. 
 Under the 2020 Margin Facility, as amended, the Borrowers may borrow up to million in revolving loans and, subject to certain terms and conditions, may enter into an amendment to the 2020 Margin Facility to borrow up to million in revolving loans (including the initial revolving loans) from the same initial lender and/or additional lenders on substantially identical terms and conditions as the initial revolving loans. The 2020 Margin Facility matures on March 4, 2027. Outstanding amounts under the 2020 Margin Facility, if any, bear interest quarterly at a rate per annum equal to a three-month adjusted SOFR plus an applicable margin. The 2020 Margin Facility requires the Borrowers to maintain a certain loan-to-value ratio (based on the value of D B and Alight shares). In the event the Borrowers fail to maintain such loan-to-value ratio, the Borrowers must post additional cash collateral under the Loan Agreement and/or elect to repay a portion of the revolving loans thereunder, or sell the D B and/or Alight shares and use the proceeds from such sale to prepay a portion of the revolving loans thereunder. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was million outstanding balance under the 2020 Margin Facility, million of unused capacity with an option to increase the capacity to million upon amendment, and million shares of D B and million shares of Alight were pledged as collateral for borrowings. 
 
 million. On May 12, 2022, FNF and Cannae amended and restated the revolver note to, among other things, limit the use of proceeds for borrowings thereunder to the repurchase of our own shares of common stock from FNF (as amended and restated, the "FNF Note"). Pursuant to the FNF Note, FNF may make one or more loans to us with up to million outstanding at any time. The FNF Note accrues interest at one-month adjusted SOFR plus basis points and matures on November 17, 2025. The maturity date is automatically extended for additional terms unless notice of non-renewal is otherwise provided by either FNF or Cannae, in their sole discretion. 
 On June 28, 2022, we completed the repurchase of all of our common stock previously held by FNF; accordingly, there is no incremental borrowing capacity available under the FNF Note. 
 On January 29, 2024, the FNF Note was amended to (i) reduce the borrowing capacity to million and (ii) change the interest rate to a fixed rate of per annum. The Company also repaid million of outstanding principal under the FNF Note. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was a million outstanding principal amount which incurred interest at and there is available borrowing capacity under the FNF Note.

 of the restaurants; individual and purported class or collective action claims alleging violation of federal and state employment, franchise and other laws; and claims from guests or employees alleging illness, injury or other food quality, health or operational concerns. Our Restaurant Group companies are also subject to compliance with extensive government laws and regulations related to employment practices and policies and the manufacture, preparation, and sale of food and alcohol. We may also become subject to lawsuits and other proceedings, as well as card network fines and penalties, arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our customers' credit or debit card information. 
 We review lawsuits and other legal and regulatory matters (collectively "legal proceedings") on an ongoing basis when making accrual and disclosure decisions. When assessing reasonably possible and probable outcomes, management bases its decision on its assessment of the ultimate outcome assuming all appeals have been exhausted. For legal proceedings in which it has been determined that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, a liability based on known facts that represents our best estimate is recorded. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our accrual for settlements of legal proceedings was not considered material. Actual losses may materially differ from the amounts recorded and the ultimate outcome of our pending legal proceedings is generally not yet determinable. While some of these matters could be material to our operating results or cash flows for any particular period in the event of an unfavorable outcome, at present, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of currently pending legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Unconditional Purchase Obligations 
 We have certain unconditional purchase obligations, primarily in our Restaurant Group segment. These purchase obligations are with various vendors and are primarily related to food and beverage obligations with fixed commitments in regard to the time period of the contract and the quantities purchased with annual price adjustments that can fluctuate. We used both historical and projected volume and pricing as of September 30, 2024 to determine the amount of the obligations.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Quarterly Report") that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), including statements regarding our expectations, hopes, intentions or strategies regarding the future. All forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, could, expect, intend, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, continue, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. It is important to note that our actual results could vary materially from those forward-looking statements contained herein due to many factors, including, but not limited to: changes in general economic, business and political conditions, including changes in the financial markets and changes in macroeconomic conditions resulting from the outbreak of a pandemic or escalation of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; risks associated with the Investment Company Act of 1940; our potential inability to find suitable acquisition candidates, acquisitions in lines of business that will not necessarily be limited to our traditional areas of focus, or difficulties in integrating acquisitions; significant competition that our operating subsidiaries face; risks related to the externalization of certain of our management functions to our Manager; and other risks detailed in the "Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information," "Risk Factors" and other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our "Annual Report") and other filings with the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, as used herein, the terms we, us, our, Cannae, or the Company refer collectively to Cannae Holdings, Inc., and its subsidiaries. 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report. For an additional description of our business, including descriptions of segments and recent business developments, see the discussion in Note A - Basis of Financial Statements and Note E - Segment Information to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report, which is incorporated by reference into this Part I, Item 2. 
 Seasonality and Macroeconomic Conditions 
 Restaurant Group . Average weekly sales per restaurant are typically higher in the first half of the year, and we typically generate a disproportionate share of our earnings from operations in the first half of the year. Holidays, severe weather and other disruptive conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. 
 Recent years were a period of high inflation relative to long-term inflation expectations in the U.S. This inflationary environment primarily impacted the commodity and labor costs of our Restaurant Group. We have adjusted menu pricing to account for these cost increases to an extent, but will continue to balance the impact of inflationary pressures on our costs with the value proposition offered to customers, focusing on long-term profitability. 
 Our revenues and operating income in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors that are beyond our control and, as a result, are likely to fluctuate. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates disclosed in Item 7 of our Annual Report are hereby incorporated by reference. Other than as described below, there have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates. 
 Investments in unconsolidated affiliates - impairment monitoring . On an ongoing basis, management monitors the Company's investments in unconsolidated affiliates to determine whether there are indications that the fair value of an investment may be other-than-temporarily below our recorded book value of the investment. Factors considered when determining whether a decline in the fair value of an investment is other-than-temporary include, but are not limited to: the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than book value, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the investee for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our ownership interest in Alight based on quoted market prices was 388.3 million and the book value of our recorded asset for Alight was 485.3 million. While the fair value of our investment in Alight is below our book value as of September 30, 2024, there are other indicators that our investment is not other than temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2024. The fair value of our investment in Alight has been below book value for approximately 5 months. Alight recently completed the sale of the Payroll Professional Services Business and used a portion of the proceeds to pay off a significant portion of its debt, improving its' capital strength. Alight has consistently reported strong gross profit and operating cash flows subsequent to our initial investment. Due to these factors, we consider the decline in fair value to be temporary as of September 30, 2024. Though we do not currently believe our investment in Alight is other than temporarily impaired, because the fair value is below the book value of our investment as of September 30, 2024, further declines in fair

Table of Contents 

value of the investment, deterioration in Alight's actual or forecasted results of operations or adverse changes in the U.S. macroeconomic environment could result in an impairment charge in future periods to record our asset at fair value. 
 
 As of June 30, 2024, the book value of our investment in Sightline accounted for under the equity method of accounting prior to recording impairment was 154.7 million. Based on a valuation using a hybrid discounted cash flow and market comparison approach and adjusted for the risk of a capital shortfall at the business, the aggregate fair market value of our ownership of Sightline equity was approximately 13.7 million as of June 30, 2024. The fair value measurement is considered a level 3 fair value measure. The primary inputs in the valuation were the forecasted results of operations of Sightline, the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis and the adjustment for the risk of a capital shortfall. The primary significant unobservable input used was the 35 discount rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis and the 50 adjustment for the risk of capital shortfall. 
 Due to the quantum of the decrease in the fair market value of our ownership interest subsequent to our acquisition, declines in the forecasted results of operations and liquidity of Sightline, and the uncertainty of the ability of Sightline to raise new capital, management determined the decrease in value of our investment in Sightline was other-than-temporary as of June 30, 2024. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment of 141.0 million which is included in Recognized (losses) gains, net, on our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Accounting for Income Taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred taxes, if any, is applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled and reflected in the financial statements in the period enacted. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a net deferred tax asset of million, which is primarily attributable to temporary differences for our investments in unconsolidated affiliates held through partnerships. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an additional valuation allowance of million on the Company's federal net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards and certain deferred taxes related to our consolidated partnerships. In the first quarter of 2024 it was determined that the net taxable capital gain from our sales of shares of Dayforce and D B would likely be offset by other sources of current year taxable loss. Accordingly, we determined it was uncertain whether we would be able to use the Company's available federal NOL carryforwards and certain other deferred taxes. One of the factors used in assessing the need for a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets is whether a company is in a three-year cumulative book loss position and for the three years ended December 31, 2023, the Company was in a cumulative book loss position. The Company is relying on deferred tax liabilities, and the ability to carry back capital losses, as sources of income to facilitate the recovery of its remaining deferred tax assets. The Company s prospective investment strategy, fluctuations in the fair market value of its ownership interests prior to any dispositions and other factors may influence the timing of reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities and their ultimate impact on taxable income or loss, which could have an effect on the recoverability of deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a federal valuation allowance of 58.7 million representing a full valuation allowance on its federal NOL carryforwards and certain other deferred taxes where it is not more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized. Additionally, a state valuation allowance of 4.8 million has been recorded representing certain state NOLs where it is not more likely than not that the tax benefit of certain state NOLs will be realized before the NOLs in those certain states expire. At this time, we consider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income and available excess capital gain from prior year periods that will allow us to realize our other deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to monitor the recoverability of deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and may need to record an additional valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset in future periods.

 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The following is a discussion of the material fluctuations in our consolidated results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The material changes in revenues, expenses and pre-tax loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are discussed in further detail at the segment level below. 
 Revenues 
 Total revenues decreased 29.7 million, or 20.7 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The reduction in revenue is primarily attributable to the closure of O'Charley's locations in 2023. 
 Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, cost of restaurant revenue, other operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization. 
 Cost of restaurant revenue includes cost of food and beverage, primarily the costs of beef, groceries, produce, seafood, poultry and alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, net of vendor discounts and rebates, payroll and related costs and expenses directly relating to restaurant level activities, and restaurant operating costs including occupancy and other operating expenses at the restaurant level. 
 Personnel costs include base salaries, commissions, benefits, stock-based compensation and bonuses paid to employees, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. Personnel costs that are directly attributable to the restaurant-level operations of the Restaurant Group are included in Cost of restaurant revenue.

Other operating expenses include management fees, carried interest fees, professional fees, advertising costs, travel expenses and impairments of operating assets. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense consists of our depreciation related to investments in property and equipment as well as amortization of intangible assets. 
 Pre-Tax Earnings (Loss) 
 Earnings (loss) before income taxes and equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates increased (decreased loss) 188.3 million, or 101.7 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income tax benefit was 6.2 million and 40.5 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate was (193.8) and 21.9 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate fluctuates depending on our estimate of ultimate income tax liability and changes in the characteristics of net earnings, such as the weighting of operating income versus other income or earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates. The change in our effective tax rate in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 is primarily attributable to the impact to the rate of equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates relative to pre-tax losses. 
 Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Affiliates 
 Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In millions) Dun Bradstreet (1.7) (1.4) Alight (6.6) (4.5) Sightline (2.2) (4.9) Black Knight Football (14.4) (3.7) Other (2.0) (11.5) Total (26.9) (26.0) 
 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The following is a discussion of the material fluctuations in our consolidated results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The material changes in revenues, expenses and pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are discussed in further detail at the segment level below. 
 Revenues 
 Total revenues decreased 108.1 million, or 24.0 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The reduction in revenue is primarily attributable to the closure of O'Charley's locations in 2023. 
 Pre-Tax Earnings (Loss) 
 Earnings (loss) before income taxes and equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates increased (decreased loss) 4.5 million, or 2.0 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense (benefit) was 13.5 million and (59.7) million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate was (6.3) and 27.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate fluctuates depending on our estimate of ultimate income tax liability and changes in the characteristics of net earnings, such as the weighting of operating income versus other income or earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates. The change in our effective tax rate in the nine months September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 is attributable to the recording of a valuation allowance in the current period of 58.9 million on our federal net operating loss carryforwards and certain deferred taxes within our consolidated partnerships, the impact to the rate of equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates relative to pre-tax loss and the impairment recorded to our investment in Sightline.

 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Total revenues for the Restaurant Group segment decreased 29.1 million, or 22.2 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The change was attributable to approximately 22.1 million of incremental revenue included in the three months ended September 30, 2023 associated with O'Charley's stores that were closed prior to 2024 and a decline in comparable store sales. 
 Comparable Store Sales. One method we use in evaluating the performance of our restaurants is to compare sales results for restaurants period over period. A new restaurant is included in our comparable store sales figures starting in the first period following the restaurant's first seventy-eight weeks of operations.

Total revenues for Black Knight Football increased 66.0 million, or 57.9 , in the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the fact that the period in 2023 was shorter due to the date we acquired our initial interest in BKFC along with an increase in matchday and sponsorship revenue. Personnel costs for BKFC increased 13.0 million, or 35.3 , in the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in these costs was attributable to the acquisition of new players at AFC Bournemouth.

The increase was attributable to the acquisition of new players at AFC Bournemouth and the fact that the period in 2023 was shorter due to the date we acquired our initial interest in BKFC (December 13, 2022). Net loss in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 was further impacted by an impairment charge of 12.0 million to BKFC's investment in FC Lorient resulting from the club's relegation to Ligue 2.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Requirements. Our short and long term cash requirements include management fees, personnel costs, other operating expenses, taxes, payments of interest and principal on our debt, capital expenditures, dividends on our common stock, and other potential business acquisitions or investments, including the Watkins Acquisition. On November 7, 2024, our Board declared cash dividends of 0.12 per share, payable on December 31, 2024, to Cannae common shareholders of record as of December 17, 2024. There are no restrictions on our retained earnings regarding our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. The declaration of any future dividends is at the discretion of our Board. Additional uses of cash flow over the short and long term are expected to include stock repurchases and debt repayments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 160.7 million, of which 146.5 million was cash held by the corporate holding company, 8.9 million of short-term investments held by the corporate holding company, and 49.0 million of immediate capacity under our existing holding company credit facilities with the ability to add an additional 350.0 million of borrowing capacity by amending our 2020 Margin Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we have pledged 7.0 million of our short term investments as collateral for letters of credit for our Restaurant Group. 
 We continually assess our capital allocation strategy, including decisions relating to monetizing investments, reducing debt, repurchasing our stock, and/or conserving cash. We believe that all anticipated cash requirements for current operations will be met from internally generated funds, cash dividends from subsidiaries, cash generated by investment securities, potential sales of non-strategic assets, and borrowings on existing credit facilities. Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are monitored regularly to ensure that we can meet our cash requirements. We forecast the needs of all of our subsidiaries and periodically review their short-term and long-term projected sources and uses of funds, as well as the asset, liability, investment and cash flow assumptions underlying such forecasts. 
 We are focused on evaluating our assets and ownership interests as potential vehicles for creating liquidity. Our intent is to use that liquidity for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions, potentially reducing debt, repurchasing shares of our stock, paying dividends on our stock, other strategic initiatives and/or conserving cash. 
 Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Operating Cash Flow . Our cash flows used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 78.1 million and 54.5 million, respectively. The increase in cash used in operations of 23.6 million is primarily attributable to increased investment success bonuses paid related to sales of Dayforce and professional fees and termination fees associated with the Third Amended MSA. 
 Investing Cash Flows. Our cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 307.1 million and (33.6) million, respectively. The increase in cash provided by investing activities of 340.7 million in the 2024 period from the 2023 period is primarily attributable to higher proceeds from sales of investments and a decrease in new investments made in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. 
 Financing Cash Flows. Our cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 174.5 million and 101.5 million, respectively. The increase in cash used in financing activities of 73.0 million is primarily attributable to the Tender Offer, partial repayment of the FNF Note and dividends paid in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by a net increase in debt borrowings in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and treasury repurchases in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Financing Arrangements. For a description of our financing arrangements, see Note G - Notes Payable included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 2 of Part I. 
 Seasonality. There have been no material changes to the seasonality experienced in our businesses from those described for the period as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report. 
 Contractual Obligations. Our long-term contractual obligations generally include our credit agreements and other debt facilities, lease payments and financing obligations on certain of our premises and equipment, purchase obligations of the Restaurant Group and payments to our Manager.

 Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The Restaurant Group has unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors, primarily related to food and beverage obligations with fixed commitments in regard to the time period of the contract and the quantities purchased with annual price adjustments that can fluctuate. Future purchase obligations are estimated by assuming historical purchase activity over the remaining, non-cancellable terms of the various agreements. For agreements with minimum purchase obligations, at least the minimum amounts we are legally required to purchase are included. These agreements do not include fixed delivery terms. We used both historical and projected volume and pricing as of September 30, 2024 to determine the amount of these obligations. 
 On February 26, 2024, the Company, Cannae LLC and Trasimene entered into the Third Amended MSA. The Third Amended MSA amends the management services agreement primarily to (i) provide for a termination of the agreement by the Company effective June 30, 2027, (ii) reduce the management fee to a fixed amount of 7.6 million annually effective beginning July 2, 2024 and (iii) provide for payment of the termination fee under the agreement of 20 million to be paid by the Company to Trasimene in installments of 6.7 million annually over the three-year period ended July 1, 2026. The Third Amended MSA has a termination date of June 30, 2027 unless earlier terminated by the Company or Trasimene. 
 Restaurant Group financing obligations include its agreements to lease its corporate office and certain restaurant equipment, which are accounted for as failed sale and leaseback transactions.

 Capital Stock Transactions . On August 3, 2022, our Board authorized a three-year stock repurchase program (the "2022 Repurchase Program"), under which the Company may repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of its common stock. Purchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing prices or in privately negotiated transactions through August 3, 2025.
