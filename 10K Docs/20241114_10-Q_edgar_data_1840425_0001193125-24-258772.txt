SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

(UNAUDITED) 

or more businesses or entities (the Business Combination ). The Company is an emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity since inception relates to the Company s formation and the initial public offering Initial Public Offering which is described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of an initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income
 in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. 
 The registration statement for the Company s Initial Public Offering (the Registration Statement was declared effective on February 9, 2023. On February 14, 2023, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of units Units and, with respect to the common stock included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares ), generating gross proceeds of , which is described in Note 3. 
 On February 17, 2023, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full. The closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units occurred (the Over-Allotment Option Units on February 21, 2023. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of Over-Allotment Option Units at a price of per unit generated total gross proceeds of . 
 Simultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Units, the Company consummated the private placement (the Private Placement of Units (the Private Placement Units ), to Bellevue Global Life Sciences Investors LLC (the Sponsor at a price of per Placement Unit, for an aggregate purchase price of . Each Unit and Private Placement Unit consists of share of common stock, par value (the Common Stock ), a warrant to purchase share of Common Stock (the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants and collectively, the Warrants and right which entitles the holder thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10)
 of a share of common stock (the Public Rights and Private Placement Rights and collectively, the Rights ), as described in Notes 3 and 4. 
 The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least of the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). 
 Upon closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Private Placement, the sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units and the additional Trust Account funding, a total of was placed in a trust account Trust Account located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money 

These Public Shares were recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ). In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Charter ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Initial Stockholders (as defined below) have agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined below in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. 
 
 Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information
 and (ii) to clear all trades with the Company s legal counsel or compliance officer prior to execution. In addition, the Company s Sponsor and any other holders of the Company s common stock prior to the Initial Public Offering (or their permitted transferees (the Initial Stockholders )) have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares, Placement Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of its Business Combination and the Company does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company s Charter provides that a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of
 of more of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Initial Public Offering without the prior consent of the Company. 
 The Company s Initial Stockholders and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC Chardan ), the representative of the underwriters, have agreed not to propose or vote in favor of an amendment to the Company s Charter (A) that would modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Business Combination or to redeem
 of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within or such other time period as the stockholders may approve from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the Combination Period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial Business
 Combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public shares in conjunction with such an amendment. 

of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of the then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 
 The Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares (defined in Note 4) and Placement Shares held by them if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Stockholders acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission (see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) may be less than approximately 10.175 per share initially held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective partner business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective partner businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

At the May Special Meeting, the Company s stockholders approved the proposal to amend the Company s Charter to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from May 14, 2024 to November 14, 2024. Following such approval by the Company s stockholders, the Company has subsequently amended the Charter to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination to November 14, 2024. In connection with the May Special Meeting, shares of common stock of the Company were tendered for redemption at a redemption price of approximately per share for an aggregate redemption amount of , leaving in the Trust Account immediately after the redemptions and a tax withdrawal by the Company of .

As of September 30, 2024, the Company s obligations for franchise taxes remain payable. 
 
 Nasdaq Listing Rules Compliance 

 As previously reported by the Company on Form 8-K filed
 on June 28, 2023, due to the resignation of a director effective on June 21, 2023, the Company notified the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq that the Company was not currently in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2)(A) (the Listing Rule ). The Listing Rule requires the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors be composed of at least three members, each of whom must meet independence requirements under the Nasdaq Listing Rules and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. BLAC regained compliance with the Listing Rule on June 23, 2024. 
 As previously reported by the Company on Form 8-K
 filed on June 13, 2024, due to the resignation of directors effective on June 7, 2024, the Company notified the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq that the Company was not currently in compliance with Nasdaq s majority independent board, compensation committee composition and audit committee composition requirements as described in Nasdaq Listing Rules 5605(b)(1), 5605(d)(2)(A) and 5605(c)(2)(A), respectively (the Additional Listing Rules ). BLAC regained compliance with the Additional Listing Rules on June 23, 2024. 
 On February 15, 2024, the Company received a notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying the Company that the Company no longer meets the minimum 300 public holders requirement for The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) (the Minimum Public Holders Requirement ). The notice is only a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and has no current effect on the listing or trading of the Company s securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market. On April 1, 2024, the Company submitted to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Public Holders Requirement and, on April 17, 2024, the staff of Nasdaq approved the plan and granted the Company an extension until August 13, 2024 to demonstrate compliance with the Minimum Public Holders Requirement (the Compliance Period ). 

in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of . The Company s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering had been satisfied through proceeds from advances from related party and from the issuance of common stock. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company s liquidity was satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the proceeds from the Private Placement Units held outside of the Trust Account and loans from the Sponsor, officers and directors and their affiliates. 
 Based on the foregoing and the limited amount of working capital that the Company received into the operating account from the Private Placement and issuances of promissory notes, management believes that the Company will not have sufficient working capital to meet its working capital needs through the earlier of the consummation of an Initial Business Combination or February 14, 2025 (subject to extension by approval of the Company s stockholders). These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Over this time period, the Company has used and will be using the remaining funds held outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the initial Business Combination. Further needs for operating capital beyond the Company s current operating cash balance may need to be funded through loans from the Company s Sponsor, officers and directors and their affiliates. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

and in cash held in its operating account as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company had cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Public Units, each Public Unit is comprised of share of common stock, par value, a warrant to purchase share of Common Stock, and Public Right to receive one-tenth (1/10)
 of one share of Common Stock. Simultaneously, with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company engaged in a private placement and issued placement units that are identical to the Public Unit, which included the issuance and delivery of aggregate of Placement Rights underlying Placement Units (the Placement Rights , and together with the Public Rights and such other rights as the Company issues from time to time hereunder, the Rights ).

 Underwriting Agreement 

 The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option
 from the final prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. 
 The underwriters were entitled to an underwriting discount of per Unit, or in the aggregate, equal to of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (or in the aggregate if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full), payable upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering; provided that for each Unit purchased by investors that are sourced by the Sponsor, such underwriting discount was reduced to per Unit payable in cash. In addition, per Unit, or approximately in the aggregate (or in the aggregate if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amount held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. In addition, the underwriters are entitled to receive shares of Common Stock (or shares if the underwriters over- allotment option is exercised in full) from the Sponsor, which will be placed in escrow until the consummation of an initial Business Combination. Such shares paid to the underwriters are referred to as the Equity Participation Shares. If a Business Combination is not consummated, the Equity Participation Shares will be returned to the Sponsor.

 As a result, subject to certain rules, the Excise Tax Liability will apply to any redemption by a U.S.-domiciled special purpose acquisition company SPAC taking place after December 31, 2022, including redemptions (i) by stockholders in connection with the SPAC s initial Business Combination or a proxy vote to extend the lifespan of the SPAC, (ii) by SPACs if the SPAC does not complete a de-SPAC transaction
 within the required time set forth in its constituent documents, or (iii) in connection with the wind-up and
 liquidation of the SPAC. The financial responsibility for such Excise Tax resides with the Company and the Sponsor. This amount of has been included in these unaudited condensed financial statements. 
 At this time, it has been determined that the IR Act tax provisions have an impact to the Company s fiscal 2023 income tax provision as there were redemptions by the public stockholders in November 2023 and May 2024; as a result, the Company recorded and excise tax liability as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Risks and Uncertainties 

 United States and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the geopolitical instability resulting from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the recent escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict. In response to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO deployed additional military forces to eastern Europe, and the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have announced various sanctions and restrictive actions against Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities, including the removal of certain financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication payment system. Certain countries, including the United States, have also provided and may continue to provide military aid or other assistance to Ukraine and to Israel, increasing geopolitical tensions among a number of nations. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict and the resulting measures that have been taken, and could be taken in the future, by NATO, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Israel and its neighboring states and other countries have created global security concerns that could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies. Although the length and impact of the ongoing conflicts are highly unpredictable, they could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions and increased cyberattacks against U.S. companies. Additionally, any resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets. 
 Any of the above mentioned factors, or any other negative impact on the global economy, capital markets or other geopolitical conditions resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict and subsequent sanctions or related actions, could adversely affect the Company s search for an initial business combination and any target business with which the Company may ultimately consummate an initial business combination.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations References in this report (the Quarterly Report to we, us or the Company refer to by Bellevue Life Sciences Acquisition Corp. References to our management or our management team refer to our officers and directors, and references to the Sponsor refer to Bellevue Global Life Sciences Investors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, could, would, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, continue, or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in our other filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Overview We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering IPO and the private placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our capital stock in connection with our initial business combination, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to banks or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. The issuance of additional shares in connection with an initial business combination: 

may significantly dilute the equity interests of our existing investors; 

may subordinate the rights of holders of our common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock; 

could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; 

may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and 

may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock, warrants and/or rights. Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant indebtedness, it could result in: 

default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 
 25 

Table of Contents 

acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 

our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; 

our inability to pay dividends on our common stock; 

using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general corporate purposes; 

limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; 

limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution of our strategy; and 

other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.

Results of Operations Our entire activity since inception through September 30, 2024 related to our formation and IPO, and subsequent to the IPO, related to identifying a target company for an initial business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of an initial business combination. We generated non-operating income in the form of interest income on investments held after our IPO. We will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, an initial business combination. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 230,961 which consisted of general and administrative expenses of 454,132 and provision for income taxes of 46,033, offset by income from investments held in the Trust Account of 269,204. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 78,183, which consisted of income from investments held in the Trust Account of 618,499, offset by general and administrative expenses of 410,431 and provision for income taxes of 129,885. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 388,686 which consisted of general and administrative expenses of 1,380,457 and provision for income taxes of 223,762, offset by income from investments held in the Trust Account of 1,215,533.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Our liquidity needs had been satisfied prior to the completion of our IPO through a capital contribution from our Sponsor of 25,000 for the founder shares and an aggregate of 1,498,000 in loans from our Sponsor under unsecured promissory notes. Upon the closing of our IPO, the promissory notes were be deemed to be repaid and settled in connection with the private placement. Further, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our financing and acquisition plans. The net proceeds from (i) the sale of the Units in our IPO (including the Units sold in the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option), after deducting offering expenses of approximately 1,310,000, underwriting commissions of 1,380,000 and excluding deferred underwriting commissions of 2,070,000, and (ii) the sale of the Private Placement Units for an aggregate purchase price of 4,300,000 was 70,610,000. Of this amount, 70,207,500 was placed in the Trust Account, including 2,070,000 of deferred underwriting commissions. The proceeds held in the Trust Account was invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. In connection with the Special Meeting and the May Special Meeting, 35,995,728 and 17,045,763, respectively, of redemptions from the Trust Account were made leaving 20,327,120 in the Trust Account following the May Special Meeting. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less deferred underwriting commissions), to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes. We estimate our annual franchise tax obligations, based on the number of authorized shares of our common stock, to be 200,000, which is the maximum amount of annual franchise taxes payable by us as a Delaware corporation per annum, which we may pay from funds held outside of the Trust Account or from interest earned on the funds held in our Trust Account and released to us for this purpose. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account. We expect the interest earned on the amount in the Trust Account will be sufficient to pay our income taxes. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 12,236 in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of 3,901,465. The Company s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of our IPO had been satisfied through proceeds from advances from related party and from the issuance of common stock. Subsequent to the consummation of our IPO, the Company s liquidity was satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the IPO, the proceeds from the Private Placement Units held outside of the Trust Account and loans from the Sponsor, officers and directors and their affiliates. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an initial business combination, our Sponsor, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into Units, at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender, upon consummation of our initial business combination. The Units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. The terms of such loans by our Sponsor, officers and directors or their affiliates, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor, officers and directors or their affiliates as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account. Loans made by Chardan or any of its related persons, if any, will not be convertible into any of our securities and Chardan and its related persons will have no recourse with respect to their ability to convert their loans into any of our securities. Based on the foregoing and the limited amount of working capital that the Company received into the operating account from the private placement, management believes that the Company will not have sufficient working capital to meet its working capital needs through the earlier of the consummation of an initial business combination or February 14, 2025 (subject to extension by approval of the Company s stockholders). These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Over this time period, the Company will be using the remaining funds held outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial business combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, 
 32

and structuring, negotiating and consummating the initial business combination. Further needs for operating capital beyond the Company s current operating cash balance may need to be funded through loans from the Company s Sponsor, officers and directors and their affiliates. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by February 14, 2025 (subject to extension by approval of the Company s stockholders), the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. This date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution combined with uncertainty as to whether the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund operations through the liquidation date or thereafter should a deferral occur raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management intends to complete a business combination. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an affiliate of our Sponsor a monthly fee of 7,500, for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. We began incurring these fees on March 1, 2023 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation. Chardan is entitled to a deferred underwriting commission of 2,070,000. The deferred fee will be waived by Chardan in the event that we do not complete an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Also, we have incurred deferred legal fees payable upon consummation of our initial business combination of approximately 1,068,261 as of September 30, 2024. These fees only become due and payable upon the consummation of a business combination. The holders of the founder shares, equity participation shares, placement units, and units that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to the registration rights agreement. These holders are entitled to make up to two demands, excluding short form registration demands, that we register such securities for sale under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders will have piggyback registration rights to include their securities in other registration statements filed by us. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Chardan may not exercise its demand and piggyback registration rights after five and seven years, respectively, after the date of our prospectus issued in connection with our IPO and may not exercise its demand rights on more than one occasion. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 because of the identification of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to the use by the Company of funds withdrawn for the payment of franchise tax and income tax liabilities for the payment of general corporate expenses and insufficient personnel in its accounting and finance reporting group. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us or any of our officers or directors in their corporate capacity. 

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS 

 In addition to the risk factors set forth below and the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 17, 2024 (or 2023 Annual Report ), in our prospectus dated February 9, 2023 IPO Prospectus ), and in the other reports we file with the SEC before making a decision to invest in our securities. These factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report or we could face liquidation. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described in our 2023 Annual Report, IPO Prospectus, and other reports we filed with the SEC and below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 We are currently not in compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements. A high number of redemptions could impact our ability to regain compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements. If we are unable to regain compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements, our securities could be delisted, which could affect our securities market price and liquidity. 

On February 15, 2024, we received a written notice (the Notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(3), which requires us to have at least 300 public holders for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the Minimum Public Holders Rule ). The Notice is only a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and has no current effect on the 

35 

Table of Contents 

 listing or trading of our securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company submitted a plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Public Holders Rule to Nasdaq on April 1, 2024. On April 17, 2024, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq granting an extension to August 13, 2024 to regain compliance with the Minimum Public Holders Rule (the Compliance Period ). On August 20, 2024, the Company received written notice (the Second Notice from Nasdaq stating that the Company has not regained compliance with the Minimum Public Holders Rule within the Compliance Period. In accordance with the Second Notice, the Company timely requested a hearing before the Hearings Panel (the Panel ), which automatically stayed any suspension or delisting action of the Company s securities and was held on October 1, 2024. On October 4, 2024, the Panel granted the Company s request for continued listing on the Nasdaq, subject to the requirement that on or before February 17, 2025, the Company shall demonstrate compliance with Listing Rule 5505, and that during the exception period, the Company shall provide prompt notification of any significant events that occur during this time that may affect the Company s compliance with Nasdaq requirements. 
 The redemptions resulting from the Annual Meeting of the Company s stockholders held on November 12, 2024, has further reduced the number of public holders and may impact our ability to adhere to our proposed plan or regain with the Minimum Public Holders Rule. 

If we are deemed to be an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ), our activities would be severely restricted. 

The funds in the trust account have, since our IPO, been held only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
 under the Investment Company Act, and we may be deemed to be an investment company. The longer that the funds in the trust account are held in short-term U.S. government treasury obligations or in money market funds invested exclusively in such securities, the greater the risk that we may be considered an unregistered investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, in which case we may be required to liquidate the Company. The risk of being deemed subject to the Investment Company Act may increase the longer the Company holds securities, and also may increase to the extent the funds in the trust account are not held in cash. Accordingly, we may determine, in our discretion, to transfer the investments held in the trust account at any time and instead hold all funds in the trust account in interest-bearing accounts, which would further reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. 
 If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities would be severely restricted. In addition, we would be subject to burdensome compliance requirements. We do not believe that our principal activities will subject us to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, if we are deemed to be an investment company and subject to compliance with and regulation under the Investment Company Act, we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and expenses for which we have not allotted funds. As a result, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead liquidate the Company. If we are required to liquidate, our stockholders will miss the opportunity to benefit from an investment in a target company and the appreciation in value of such investment through an initial business combination. Additionally, if we are required to liquidate, there will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants and rights, which will expire worthless in the event of our winding up.
