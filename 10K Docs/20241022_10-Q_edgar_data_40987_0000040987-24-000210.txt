 billion, which are designated as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total borrowings of the independents and affiliates subject to guarantee by us were approximately million. This number decreased from million as of December 31, 2023 due to acquisitions of our independent stores, including Motor Parts and Equipment Corporation ("MPEC") in April 2024 and Walker Automotive Supply, Inc. ("Walker") in July 2024. These loans generally mature over periods from one to . We regularly monitor the performance of these loans and the ongoing operating results, financial condition and ratings from credit rating agencies of the independents and affiliates that participate in the guarantee programs. In the event that we are required to make payments in connection with these guarantees, we would obtain and liquidate certain collateral pledged by the independents or affiliates (e.g., accounts receivable and inventory) to recover all or a substantial portion of the amounts paid under the guarantees. We recognize a liability equal to the current expected credit losses over the lives of the loans in the guaranteed loan portfolio, based on a consideration of historical experience, current conditions, the nature and expected value of any collateral, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. To date, we have not had significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents and affiliates borrowings and the current expected credit loss reserve is not material. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have recognized million of certain assets and liabilities for the guarantees related to the independents and affiliates borrowings. These assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other long-term liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The liabilities relate to our noncontingent obligation to stand ready to perform under the guarantee programs and they are distinct from our current expected credit loss reserve. 
 
 to days. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to us and they issue the associated invoices to us based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institutions. In turn, we direct payment to the financial institutions, rather than the suppliers, for the invoices sold to the financial institutions. No guarantees are provided by us or any of our subsidiaries on third-party performance under the SCF program; however, we guarantee the payment by our subsidiaries to the financial institutions participating in the SCF program for the applicable invoices. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program. Accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are included in the line item accounts payable in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding payment obligations to the financial institutions are billion and billion, respectively.

 term expiring in January 2025, which we intend to renew. 
 We continue to be involved with the receivables transferred by the SPE to the unaffiliated financial institutions by providing collection services. As cash is collected on sold receivables, the SPE continuously transfers ownership and control of new qualifying receivables to the unaffiliated financial institutions so that the total principal amount outstanding of receivables sold is approximately billion at any point in time (which is the maximum amount currently allowed under the A/R Sales Agreement).

 Cash collected on sold receivables 
 Continuous cash activity related to the A/R Sales Agreement is reflected in net cash provided by operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The SPE incurs fees due to the unaffiliated financial institutions related to the accounts receivable sales transactions. Those fees, which totaled million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are recorded within other non-operating (income) expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The SPE has a recourse obligation to repurchase from the unaffiliated financial institutions any previously sold receivables that are not collected due to the occurrence of certain events, including credit quality deterioration and customer sales returns. The reserve recognized for this recourse obligation as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is not material. The servicing liability related to our collection services also is not material, given the high quality of the customers underlying the receivables and the anticipated short collection period.

 billion Syndicated Facility Agreement (as amended, the "Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility"). The Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on September 30, 2026. We had outstanding borrowings under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Due to the workers compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states, we also had unused letters of credit of approximately million outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 On November 29, 2023, we established a commercial paper program that allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to billion outstanding. The maturities of the commercial paper notes may not exceed days from the date of issuance. The Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility is used as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of commercial paper outstanding under the program. We had borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have presented commercial paper activity with original maturities of or less on a net basis given their short-term nature. In the Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2024, such amounts were presented on a gross basis in Proceeds from debt and Payments on debt line items. This change in presentation does not impact previously reported net cash used in financing activities. We had net commercial paper activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and no activity in the prior year period. 
 On August 7, 2024, we issued million of unsecured Senior Notes due 2029. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2025. We intend to utilize the proceeds of this offering to repay the Series J Private Placement Notes and have utilized a portion of the proceeds to repay indebtedness under our commercial paper program that was outstanding as of June 30, 2024. Any remaining amounts will be utilized for general corporate purposes. 
 The weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings was approximately as of September 30, 2024. Certain borrowings require us to comply with a financial covenant with respect to a maximum debt to EBITDA ratio. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for further information regarding the Company's indebtedness.

 Service cost is recorded in selling, administrative and other expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income while all other components are recorded within other non-operating (income) expense. Pension benefits also include amounts related to supplemental retirement plans. 
 Planned Pension Plan Termination 
 On April 29, 2024, our Board of Directors approved the termination of the frozen U.S. qualified defined benefit plan (pension plan), effective September 30, 2024. We intend to transfer the management and delivery of continuing benefits associated with the pension plan to a third-party insurance company. The pension plan settlement process involves several regulatory steps and approvals. Subject to completion of these steps and approvals, settlement is expected between late 2025 and early 2026. As part of the plan settlement process, pension plan participants not currently receiving payments will have the opportunity to select a single lump sum payment or an annuity from the insurance company that will pay and administer future benefit payments. 
 Upon settlement, we expect to recognize a non-cash, pre-tax pension settlement charge in 2025 equal to the actuarial losses accumulated in AOCI, which totaled approximately million million, net of tax) as of September 30, 2024. The actual amount of the settlement charges will depend on the valuation of the pension obligation at the settlement date, which is dependent upon interest rates, U.S. pension plan asset returns, the lump sum election rate, and other factors. Once settled, we will be fully relieved of all obligations under the pension plan.

 For each acquisition, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the respective acquisition date. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary and may be subject to additional adjustments, particularly to inventory and intangible assets during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the respective acquisition dates.

 Other intangible assets acquired, totaling approximately million, consisted primarily of customer relationships and trade names with weighted average amortization lives of years. The provisional fair value of the identifiable intangible assets are subject to adjustment pending final valuation. 
 The estimated goodwill recognized as part of the acquisitions is generally not tax deductible. Goodwill of million and million has been assigned to the Automotive and Industrial segments, respectively. This goodwill is attributable primarily to the expected synergies and assembled work forces of the acquired businesses. 
 of the largest independent owners of NAPA Auto Parts Stores in the U.S., MPEC in April 2024 and Walker in July 2024. We recognized approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the MPEC and Walker acquisitions.

 Key Performance Indicators 
 We consider a variety of performance and financial measures in assessing our business, and the key performance indicators used to measure our results are Comparable Sales, Gross Profit and Gross Margin, Selling, Administrative and Other Expenses ("SG A"), Segment Profit and Segment Margin, and Net Income and EBITDA along with their adjusted measures. For more information regarding our key performance indicators please reference the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Our third quarter net sales were 6.0 billion, up 2.5 year-over-year, and net income was 227 million , down 35.5 . Acquired businesses contributed 3.2 of net sales growth, of which 1.5 was from acquired stores in our U.S. Automotive business, including Motor Parts Equipment Corporation ("MPEC") and Walker Automotive Supply, Inc. ("Walker"). An extra selling day contributed to an additional 1.1 of net sales growth. These benefits were partially offset by essentially flat comparable sales in Automotive and declines in Industrial comparable sales of 2.4 , primarily driven by ongoing weak market conditions across our geographies. We also estimate the disruption from hurricanes and the CrowdStrike technology outage in the U.S negatively impacted comparable sales in both segments by a total of 0.7 . Our gross margin improved 0.6 primarily due to the benefits of acquired stores in our U.S. Automotive business. Net income declined 35.5 primarily due to fixed cost deleveraging from declines in comparable sales and increased costs related to: personnel, rent, acquisitions, technology investments, depreciation, restructuring, and interest expense. 
 Our results of operations are summarized below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Net Sales 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 our net sales increased 2.5 compared to 2023. We experienced a 3.2 benefit from acquisitions and favorable impact of foreign currency and other of 0.1 , partially offset by a 0.8 decrease in comparable sales. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 our net sales increased 1.2 compared to 2023. We experienced a 2.4 benefit from acquisitions, partially offset by a 0.9 decrease in comparable sales and a net unfavorable impact of foreign currency and other of 0.3 . 
 The decreases in comparable sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are primarily driven by a sales decline in Industrial due to the impact of weaker macro-economic conditions on certain customers as discussed further below. Third quarter comparable sales across both segments were disrupted by Hurricanes Beryl and Helene and the CrowdStrike outage, with an estimated total negative impact of 0.7 . 
 Automotive 
 Automotive sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.8 billion, an increase of 4.8 from 2023. The increase reflects a 4.4 benefit from acquisitions which was primarily driven by acquired stores in our U.S. Automotive business, including MPEC and Walker. We also experienced a 0.2 increase in comparable sales and a 0.2 favorable impact of foreign currency and other. We faced the effects of persistent soft demand in our U.S. businesses, inclusive of sales disruption from Hurricanes Beryl and Helene and the CrowdStrike outage, and adverse economic conditions in our European automotive businesses . 
 Automotive sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 11.1 billion, an increase of 2.9 from 2023. The increase reflects a 3.4 benefit from acquisitions, partially offset by a 0.1 decrease in comparable sales and a 0.4 unfavorable impact of foreign currency and other. Year-over-year comparable sales also were impacted by persistent soft demand in the U.S., the hurricanes and CrowdStrike outage, and adverse economic conditions in Europe. 
 Industrial 
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2.2 billion, a decrease of 1.2 compared to 2023. The decrease reflects a 2.4 decrease in comparable sales and a 0.1 unfavorable impact of foreign currency, slightly offset by a 1.3 benefit from acquisitions. 
 Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 6.6 billion, a decrease of 1.5 compared to 2023. The decrease reflects a 2.2 decrease in comparable sales and a 0.1 unfavorable impact of foreign currency, slightly offset by a 0.8 benefit from acquisitions. 
 The decrease in comparable sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects continued softness in industrial production and the ongoing moderation in demand in several customer sectors. In particular, we believe certain customers that are sensitive to the interest rate environment and political uncertainty are delaying capital expenditures. We continue to experience an adverse macro-economic environment when compared to 2023, which caused slowing global industrial demand. In addition, sales disruption from Hurricanes Beryl and Helene and the CrowdStrike outage had a negative impact on third quarter net sales. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 89 million, or 4.2 , compared to the same period of the previous year, and gross margin increased 0.6 to 36.8 . The improvements are primarily driven by acquired stores in our U.S. Automotive business. 
 Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 196 million, or 3.1 compared to the same period in the prior year, and gross margin improved 0.7 to 36.4 . Approximately 50 of these improvements are due to acquired businesses . The remainder of the improvements primarily reflect the positive contributions of our strategic category management and sourcing initiatives. We continue to invest in enhancing technology to generate better pricing data and analytics which allows us to shift pricing dynamics across each market we serve.

 Selling, Administrative and Other Expenses 
 SG A expenses represent 28.8 of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.2 from the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG A expenses represent 27.9 of sales, an increase of 1.4 from the prior year. We estimate operating cost inflation, including personnel costs and rent, caused approximately 40 and 70 of the increase for the three and nine month periods, respectively. Increased operating costs from owning more U.S. automotive stores contributed approximately 25 of the increase in each period. We also incurred acquisition and integration costs and costs related to increased investments in technology, among other things. 
 Restructuring and Other Costs 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 41 million and 161 million, respectively, of costs related to the global restructuring initiative that was approved in February 2024. We recognized approximately 25 million of benefits related to this global restructuring initiative for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to the Restructuring Footnote in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our global restructuring initiative. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 22 million related to ongoing investments in technology and supply chain initiatives. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 12 million, or 75.8 , compared to the same period of the previous year, due to increased borrowing to fund acquisitions, including the senior notes issued in August 2024. 
 
 Segment Profit 
 Automotive 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Automotive segment profit decreased 18.6 compared to the same period in 2023, and Automotive segment profit margin decreased to 6.9 compared to 8.9 in the same period last year. We estimate that 40 of these declines relates to persistent segment operating cost pressures from ongoing inflation, particularly personnel costs and rent. The remainder primarily reflects the effects of rising freight costs, technology investments and changes in sales mix. Partially offsetting the declines was a 20 basis point segment profit margin benefit related to acquisitions, particularly acquired stores in U.S. Automotive such as MPEC and Walker. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Automotive segment profit decreased 7.3 compared to the same period in 2023, and Automotive segment profit margin decreased to 7.6 compared to 8.5 for the same period last year, based on similar inflationary and other segment operating cost pressures and sales mix changes. 
 Industrial 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Industrial segment profit decreased 8.5 compared to the same period in 2023 and Industrial segment profit margin was 11.9 , down 1.0 from the prior year. These declines primarily relate to persistent segment operating cost pressures from inflation, particularly personnel costs and rent. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Industrial segment profit decreased 2.6 compared to the same period last year and Industrial segment profit margin decreased to 12.2 compared to 12.3 in the same period in the previous year, based on similar inflationary segment operating cost pressures. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Our effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.9 and 23.6 , respectively, as compared to 24.5 for the same periods in 2023. The rate decrease is primarily due to expanded investment and domestic credit benefits. 
 
 Net Income, Diluted Earnings Per Share and Adjusted EBITDA 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 227 million, a decrease of 35.5 compared to net income of 351 million for the same three month period of the prior year. On a per share diluted basis, net income was 1.62, a decrease of 34.9 compared to 2.49 in 2023. These decreases are primarily due to 41 million of costs related to the global restructuring initiative, 4 million of acquisition and integration costs, persistent cost pressures from personnel costs and rent inflation, increased costs and depreciation from ongoing technology investments and increased interest costs from borrowings to fund acquisitions. For the nine months 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 ended September 30, 2024, net income was 771 million, a decrease of 22.9 compared to net income of 1.0 billion for the same nine month period of the prior year. On a per share diluted basis, net income was 5.51, a decrease of 22.2 compared to 7.08 in 2023. These decreases are primarily due to 161 million of costs related to the global restructuring initiative, 29 million of acquisition and integration costs, persistent cost pressures from personnel costs and rent inflation, increased costs and depreciation from ongoing technology investments and increased interest costs from borrowings to fund acquisitions. 
 Adjusted net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs and acquisition and integration costs, was 263 million, a decrease of 25.1 compared to net income of 351 million for the same period of 2023. On a per share diluted basis, adjusted net income was 1.88, a decrease compared to diluted earnings per share of 2.49 last year. Third quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA was 477 million, a decrease of 15.6 from 565 million in 2023. Adjusted net income, which excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs and acquisition and integration costs, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 915 million, a decrease of 8.4 compared to net income of 1.0 billion in 2023. On a per share diluted basis, adjusted net income was 6.55, a decrease of 7.5 compared to diluted earnings per share of 7.08 last year. Third quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA was 1.6 billion, a decrease of 4.4 from EBITDA of 1.6 billion from 2023. The decreases in these adjusted measures reflect the negative effects of lost expense leverage on comparable sales declines combined with increased costs, as discussed more fully in the commentary above. 
 Corporate Expense and other Segment Reconciling items 
 This section explains the material reconciling items displayed in the Segment Footnote in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, that are not discussed above including corporate expense and other unallocated costs. 
 Corporate expense reflects costs related to headquarter's broad based support to our business units and other costs that are managed centrally and not allocated to business segments. These include personnel and other costs for company-wide functions such as executive leadership, human resources, technology, cybersecurity, legal, corporate finance, internal audit, and risk management, as well as product liability costs and A/R Sales Agreement fees. Our operational objective is to maintain Corporate expenses within a range of 1.5 to 2.0 of net sales. Corporate expense amounted to 114 million and 90 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 corporate expense amounted to 284 million, or 1.6 of net sales, in 2024, compared to 258 million, or 1.5 of net sales, in 2023. 
 Corporate expenses increased in both periods primarily due to the effects of persistent inflation on personnel costs and ongoing investments in technology. 
 Other unallocated costs represent restructuring and other costs and acquisition and integration related costs and other. These increased year-over-year due to the global restructuring initiative that was approved in February 2024 and significantly increased acquisition activity in 2024. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA for each segment and Corporate are non-GAAP measures (see table below for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures). 
 The following tables set forth reconciliations of net income and diluted EPS to adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, respectively, to account for the impact of adjustments. We also include reconciliations from net income to adjusted EBITDA, segment profit to segment EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for each segment and Corporate. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted EBITDA, which are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of our core operations. We consider these metrics useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance by removing items management believes are not representative of our operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. In the case of adjusted EBITDA by segment and Corporate, we believe this additional metric is useful to investors as it provides further insight into the performance of our segments and Corporate. We believe the non-GAAP metrics included herein also enhance the comparability of our results from period to period and with our competitors, as well as to show ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not associated with our core operations. For example, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude costs relating to our global

 restructuring initiative and acquisitions of MPEC and Walker. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.

 Financial Condition 
 Our cash balance was 1.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 24 million from December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net cash provided by operating activities of 1.1 billion, net cash used in investing activities of 1.2 billion and net cash used in financing activities of 125 million. 
 The cash provided by operating activities increased as compared to prior year primarily driven by changes in working capital. We had 1.2 billion in net cash used for investing activities, consisting of capital expenditures and acquisitions and other investing activities of 1.3 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and the divestiture of businesses. The financing activities consisted primarily of 411 million for dividends paid to our shareholders and 112 million of stock repurchases. 
 Accounts receivable increased 157 million, or 7.1 , from December 31, 2023. Inventory increased 850 million, or 18.2 . Accounts receivable and inventory were both impacted by third quarter increases in revenues and 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 related product demand. Inventory also increased approximately 520 million as a result of acquiring an approximate 150 net new stores, including stores acquired in the acquisitions of MPEC and Walker. Accounts payable increased approximately 600 million, or 10.9 from December 31, 2023, in line with the increase in inventory. Total debt of 4.6 billion at September 30, 2024 decreased 712 million, or 18.2 , from December 31, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We ended the quarter with 2.6 billion of total liquidity. Total liquidity comprises of 1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 1.5 billion available on our revolving credit facility. From time to time, we may enter into other credit facilities or financing arrangements to provide additional liquidity and to manage against foreign currency risk. We currently believe that the existing lines of credit, commercial paper program, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated operations for the foreseeable future. 
 On April 29, 2024, our Board of Directors approved the termination of the frozen U.S. qualified defined benefit plan (pension plan), effective September 30, 2024. We intend to transfer the management and delivery of continuing benefits associated with the pension plan to a third-party insurance company. Upon settlement, we expect to recognize a non-cash, pre-tax pension settlement charge in 2025 equal to the actuarial losses accumulated in AOCI, which totaled approximately 620 million 450 million, net of tax) as of September 30, 2024. 
 On August 7, 2024, we issued 750 million of unsecured 4.95 Senior Notes due 2029. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2025. We intend to utilize the proceeds of this offering to repay the Series J Private Placement Notes and have utilized a portion of the proceeds to repay indebtedness under our commercial paper program that was outstanding as of June 30, 2024. Any remaining amounts will be utilized for general corporate purposes. 
 We have a strong cash position and solid financial strength to pursue strategic growth opportunities through disciplined, strategic capital deployment. Our key priorities include the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, mergers and acquisitions, the dividend and share repurchases. We have plans for additional investments in our businesses to drive growth, improve efficiencies and productivity, and drive shareholder value. 
 We expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. At September 30, 2024, our total average cost of debt was 3.49 , and we remain in compliance with all covenants connected with our borrowings. 
 Any failure to comply with our debt covenants or restrictions could result in a default under our financing arrangements or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could create cross defaults under other debt arrangements and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 On February 15, 2024, we announced a 5.3 increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend for 2024. Our Board of Directors increased the cash dividend payable to an annual rate of 4.00 per share compared with the prior year dividend of 3.80 per share. We have paid a cash dividend every year since going public in 1948, and 2024 marks the 68th consecutive year of increased dividends paid to shareholders.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures
