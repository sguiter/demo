Henry Nahmad has served as a director
of the Company and as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company since March 2015. Prior to joining the Company, Mr.
Nahmad served as Chief Executive Officer of Chemstar Corp., a provider of food safety and sanitation solutions, from July 2009 to March

products. The Board believes that Mr. Nahmad s knowledge, leadership skills, business relationships, and experience, including with
respect to growth from acquisitions and other strategic transactions, make Mr. Nahmad a valuable member of the Board and benefit the Company,
including with respect to its business, operations and growth strategy. 

Tom Marks has served as Executive
Vice President of the Company since October 2016 when he was appointed to such position in connection with the Company s acquisition

of the Company since 2016. Mr. Mack served as Executive Vice President of the Company from October 2016, when he was appointed to such
position in connection with the Company s acquisition of Western State Design at that time, until December 2023. He continues to
serve the Company in a non-executive position as strategic advisor to the Company s Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Mack founded Western
State Design in 1974 and has served as its President since its inception. The Board believes that it benefits from Mr. Mack s knowledge
of the commercial laundry industry as well as his understanding of the operations, prospects, products, customers, suppliers and employees
of Western State Design.

David Blyer has served as a director
of the Company since 1998. Since April 2017, Mr. Blyer has served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Arreva LLC, which provides

the time of its merger with Telosa Software to form Arreva. Mr. Blyer was Co-Chairman of Stone Profiles LLC (formerly Profiles in Concrete,

acquired his predecessor firm GCA Global, which he joined in 2017. He received a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from the University of

among other things, his experience and expertise with respect to the capital markets and merger and acquisition transactions.

Additional
Information Regarding Directors and Executive Officers 

Under the Company s Bylaws, each director
serves for a term expiring at the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders. Executive officers serve until they resign or are
replaced or removed by the Board of Directors. 

There is no family relationship between any director

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the
Company s directors, executive officers and 10 stockholders to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership
of the Company s Common Stock and other equity securities, if any, with the SEC and the NYSE American. The Company s directors,
executive officers and 10 stockholders are required to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based
on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to the Company and written representations from the Company s directors and
executive officers that no other reports were required, the Company believes that, except as described below, its directors, executive
officers and 10 stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to them for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2024 fiscal 2024 ). On December 19, 2023, 500 shares of the Company s Common Stock held by director Glen Kruger through

and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE American. 

Audit
Committee 

The Company s Board of Directors has a standing

the Audit Committee is financially literate and independent within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE American

(1) 
 The Company does not have an employment agreement with any of the Named Executive Officers. The compensation
 of the Named Executive Officers is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Each Named Executive Officer receives
 an annual base salary and may receive bonuses, in cash and/or equity awards, pursuant to bonus plans which may be established from time
 to time by the Compensation Committee or otherwise at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Equity awards, if any, are granted
 under the Company s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the Equity Incentive Plan ). The Named Executive Officers
 are also provided certain benefits, including health and welfare benefits and the right to participate in the Company s participatory
 Section 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan described below on the same basis as the Company s other employees. 

(2) 
 Represents the annual base salary paid to the Named Executive Officer during the applicable fiscal year. Each
 Named Executive Officer's annual base salary is subject to adjustment from time to time at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.
 During October 2023, Mr. Lazar s annual base salary was increased from 240,000 to 300,000. 

(3) 
 Represents discretionary bonuses paid upon the approval of the Compensation Committee, in each cash, based
 upon a subjective evaluation of the performance of the Company and the applicable Named Executive Officer. See Chief Executive
 Officer Compensation below for information with respect to the bonuses paid to Mr. Nahmad, including the factors considered by
 the Compensation Committee in approving such bonuses and the restricted stock awards granted to Mr. Nahmad (as described in footnote 4
 below). With respect to the bonuses paid to Mr. Marks and Mr. Lazar and the restricted stock units and awards granted to Mr. Marks and
 Mr. Lazar, respectively (as described in footnote 4 below), the Compensation Committee considered, among other things, the recommendations
 of Mr. Nahmad and the performance, financial condition and achievements of the Company. The bonus amount for Mr. Marks for each of fiscal
 2024 and 2023 is comprised of a 150,000 discretionary cash bonus and a quarterly cash bonus of 37,500 (or a total of 150,000 of quarterly
 cash bonuses during each such fiscal year). The payment of the quarterly cash bonus to Mr. Marks is at the discretion of the Compensation
 Committee and may be modified or terminated at any time by the Compensation Committee.

 Represents the aggregate grant date fair value of (i) in the case of Mr. Nahmad, a restricted stock award
 of 166,667 shares of the Company s Common Stock granted to Mr. Nahmad during October 2023 (which is included in Mr. Nahmad s
 compensation for fiscal 2024) and a restricted stock award of 202,430 shares of the Company s Common Stock granted to Mr. Nahmad
 during September 2022 (which is included in Mr. Nahmad s compensation for fiscal 2023), (ii) in the case of Mr. Marks, 18,519 restricted
 stock units granted to Mr. Marks during October 2023, each of which represents a contingent right to receive one share of the Company s
 Common Stock upon vesting (which is included in Mr. Marks compensation for fiscal 2024), and 40,486 restricted stock units granted
 to Mr. Marks during September 2022, each of which represents a contingent right to receive one share of the Company s Common Stock
 upon vesting (which is included in Mr. Marks compensation for fiscal 2023), and (iii) in the case of Mr. Lazar, a restricted stock
 award of 9,134 shares of the Company s Common Stock granted to Mr. Lazar during October 2023 (which is included in Mr. Lazar s
 compensation for fiscal 2024) and a restricted stock award of 20,242 shares of the Company Common Stock granted to Mr. Lazar during
 September 2022 (which is included in Mr. Lazar s compensation for fiscal 2023). Each such grant was made under the Company s
 Equity Incentive Plan upon the approval of the Compensation Committee. Additional information regarding these grants, including the vesting
 schedules, is set forth below under Outstanding Equity Awards at June 30, 2024 and, in the case of the grant to Mr. Nahmad,
 Chief Executive Officer Compensation. Assumptions used in the calculation of the grant date fair value of the restricted
 stock awards and units are included in Note 17 to the Company s audited consolidated financial statements contained in the Company s
 Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K. Due to the long-term vesting of a majority of these restricted stock awards and units (subject to potential vesting
 acceleration under certain circumstances) and the risk of forfeiture until vesting, the present value of the restricted stock awards and
 units is significantly less than the grant date fair value presented in the table. 

During September 2024, the Company, upon the approval
of the Compensation Committee, (i) paid discretionary cash bonuses of 650,000 to Mr. Nahmad, 150,000 to Mr. Marks and 60,000 to Mr.
Lazar, and (ii) granted (a) a restricted stock award of 248,447 shares of the Company's Common Stock to Mr. Nahmad, (b) 24,844 restricted
stock units to Mr. Marks, and (c) a restricted stock award of 15,527 shares of the Company's Common Stock to Mr. Lazar. Such restricted
stock awards and units are scheduled to vest 50 on the ten-year anniversary of the grant date and 50 in four equal annual installments
commencing in September 2025, subject to the terms and conditions of the Company s Equity Incentive Plan and the related restricted
stock award or unit agreement. Each restricted stock unit represents a contingent right to receive one share of the Company s Common
Stock upon vesting. These cash bonuses and restricted stock awards and units are not reflected in the Summary Compensation Table above
but will be included in the applicable Named Executive Officer's compensation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. In making the
compensation decisions with respect to Mr. Marks and Mr. Lazar, the Compensation Committee considered, among other things, the recommendations
of Mr. Nahmad, the current and past compensation of Mr. Marks and Mr. Lazar, and the achievements of the Company, including with respect
to its financial performance, business acquisitions, technology and modernization investments and initiatives, supplier relationships
and investor relations. See Chief Executive Officer Compensation below for additional information with respect to the bonus
paid and restricted stock award granted to Mr. Nahmad during September 2024, including the factors considered by the Compensation Committee
in approving such items. 

Chief Executive Officer
Compensation 

The compensation of Henry M. Nahmad, the Company s
Chief Executive Officer, is determined by the Compensation Committee. Mr. Nahmad receives an annual base salary and may receive bonuses,
in cash and/or equity awards, pursuant to bonus plans which may be established from time to time by the Compensation Committee or otherwise
at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. He is also provided certain benefits, including health and welfare benefits and the right
to participate in the Company s participatory Section 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan described below, on the same basis as the Company s
other employees. 

Mr. Nahmad s annual base salary during fiscal
2023 and fiscal 2024 was, and his annual base salary currently is, 650,000. 

During September 2022, the Company paid to Mr.
Nahmad a discretionary cash bonus of 550,000 and granted to Mr. Nahmad a restricted stock award of 202,430 shares of the Company s
Common Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Company s Equity Incentive Plan and the related restricted stock award
agreement, 50 of the restricted shares will cliff vest on the tenth anniversary of the grant date and 50 of the restricted shares are
scheduled to vest in four equal annual installments, with the first two installments vesting in September 2023 and September 2024, respectively.
In approving the bonus and restricted stock award grant, the Compensation Committee considered, among other things, the success and performance,

Compensation
Plans and Arrangements 

As described above, no Named Executive Officer
is a party to an employment agreement with the Company. In addition, the Company has no plans or arrangements with any Named Executive
Officer which provide for the payment of retirement benefits, or benefits that would be paid primarily following retirement, other than
the Company s participatory Section 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, a deferred compensation plan under which the Company currently matches
50 of employee contributions up to 6 of an eligible employee s yearly compensation on a discretionary basis. Such compensation
is tax deferred under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). Further, the Company has
no contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements that provide for the payment in the future to any Named Executive Officer following or
in connection with his resignation, termination of employment, or a change in control of the Company. However, outstanding restricted
stock awards and units of the Company s Common Stock, including those granted to the Named Executive Officers, will accelerate and
immediately vest, to the extent not previously vested or forfeited, in the event of the award holder s death or Disability (as defined
in the restricted stock award or unit agreements). In addition, pursuant to the Company s Equity Incentive Plan, such restricted
stock awards and units may, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, accelerate and immediately vest, to the extent not previously
vested or forfeited, upon a Change in Control of the Company (as defined in the Company s Equity Incentive Plan). In the event that
vesting is accelerated, any unrecognized stock-based compensation expense would be immediately recognized. Had the restricted stock awards
and units held by the Named Executive Officers as of June 30, 2024 vested upon their death or Disability or upon a Change in Control of
the Company, in each case, occurring on June 30, 2024, the value of the accelerated vesting would have been approximately 24.9 million
(based on the closing price of the Company s Common Stock on the NYSE American on June 30, 2024) and the Company would have recognized
approximately 21.9 million of stock-based compensation.

Director
Compensation 

The Compensation Committee, with the input and
assistance of the Company s Chief Executive Officer, recommends director compensation to the full Board of Directors. The Board
of Directors approves director compensation based on factors it considers to be appropriate, market conditions and trends, and the recommendation
of the Compensation Committee. 

The compensation program for the Company s
non-employee directors is intended to assist the Company in attracting and retaining qualified directors, reward non-employee directors
for their service on the Board and its committees through both equity awards and cash fees, and align the interests of the non-employee
directors with those of stockholders. Pursuant to the program, each non-employee director currently receives annually a grant of 50,000
of restricted stock units (based on the closing price of the Company s Common Stock on the date of grant), which generally vest
in four equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. The restricted stock units are granted under,
and subject to, the Company s Equity Incentive Plan and related restricted stock unit agreements. Each restricted stock unit represents
a contingent right to receive one share of the Company s Common Stock upon vesting. In addition, the Company s compensation
program for its non-employee directors also includes a cash component, pursuant to which (i) each non-employee director currently receives
an annual cash fee of 5,000, (ii) the Chairman of the Audit Committee currently receives an additional annual cash fee of 20,000 (which
was increased from 12,000 during December 2023), (iii) each other member of the Audit Committee currently receives an additional annual
cash fee of 5,000 (which was increased from 4,000 during December 2023), (iv) the Chairman of the Compensation Committee currently receives
an additional annual cash fee of 10,000 (which was increased from 7,500 during December 2023), and (v) each other member of the Compensation
Committee currently receives an additional annual cash fee of 7,000 (which was increased from 4,000 during December 2023). 

The Company does not provide any tax gross-ups
to its non-employee directors, all of whom are responsible for their respective tax obligations relating to their compensation for Board
and committee service. Directors are also reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with performing
their duties. Directors of the Company who are also employees of the Company do not receive compensation for their service as directors,
but are reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with performing their duties as directors.

 Shares are beneficially owned by Mr. Marks indirectly through a family trust and trusts for the benefit of
 his children.

 Includes, for each director, 1,801 shares which are covered by restricted stock units granted to such director
 that are scheduled to vest within 60 days after October 21, 2024.

 The address and share ownership information is based on the Schedule 13G/A filed by Royce Associates,

 by one or more registered investment companies or other managed accounts that are investment management clients of RALP, which is an indirect
 majority owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. FRI ). The Schedule 13G/A also states that when an investment management
 contract (including a sub advisory agreement) delegates to RALP investment discretion or voting power over the securities held in the
 investment advisory accounts that are subject to that agreement, FRI treats RALP as having sole investment discretion or voting authority,
 as the case may be, unless the agreement specifies otherwise and, accordingly, RALP reports on the Schedule 13G/A that it has sole investment
 discretion and voting authority over, and may therefore be deemed to be the beneficial owner of, the shares. 

(6) 
 In addition to the shares beneficially owned by the Company s directors and executive officers as listed
 in this table, the Company s Board of Directors also has the power to direct the voting of an additional 552,416 shares of the Company s

Item 14. Principal

Audit Fees . Audit fees were for the audits
of the Company s annual consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2024 and 2023 included in the Company s Annual Reports
on Form 10-K for those fiscal years, and reviews of the Company s quarterly financial statements included in the Company s
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q during such fiscal years. The audit fees for each fiscal year also include fees related to the auditor
attestation of management s report on internal control over financial reporting included in the Company s Annual Report on

All Other Fees. No fees other
than audit fees and tax fees were paid by the Company to BDO for fiscal 2024 or 2023. 

In connection with the standards for independence
of a company s independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee considered whether the provision of non-audit
services by BDO was compatible with maintaining the independence of such firm in the conduct of its auditing functions. 

It is the policy of the Audit Committee that all
audit, audit-related, tax and other permissible non-audit services provided by the Company s independent registered public accounting
firm be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. It is expected that pre-approval will be for periods up to one year and be set forth in an
engagement letter approved by the Audit Committee that applies to the particular services or category of services to be provided and subject
to a specific budget. The policy also requires additional approval of any engagements that were previously approved but are anticipated
to exceed the pre-approved fee budget level. The policy permits the Chairman of the Audit Committee to pre-approve services by the Company s
independent registered public accounting firm where the Company deems it necessary or advisable that such services commence prior to the
next regularly scheduled meeting of the Audit Committee, provided that the Chairman of the Audit Committee is required to report to the
full Audit Committee on any pre-approval determinations made in this manner at the next Audit Committee meeting. All of the services performed
by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm during fiscal 2024 and 2023 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
