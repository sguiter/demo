As of September 30, 2024, the Company
held six wholly-owned subsidiaries, and two subsidiaries with 51 ownership. Company establishes operating subsidiaries when a perceived

Parent Company 

for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024, has an accumulated deficit of and has only cash reserves
of as of September 30, 2024. Management has evaluated the significance of the conditions in relation to the Company s ability
to meet its obligations and believes that its current cash balance along with its current operations will not provide sufficient capital
to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon achieving sales growth, management
of operating expenses and ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities arising
from normal business operations when they come due, and upon profitable operations. 

The Company has relied on debt funding
to pay for operating expenses and business development efforts in 2024 that were not covered by operating revenues. If the Company continues
to incur operating losses as incurred within twelve months of filing date and does not significantly increase its cash reserves, and if
the Company does not also receive additional funding from existing lenders or from other sources to provide the working capital needed
to cover those continuing operating losses, then the Company would be forced to reduce its operating expenses and business development
efforts and the issue of the Company as a going concern may arise. While the existing lenders of the Company and Company's majority shareholder
are affiliated, there can be no assurance of additional debt or equity funding for the Company from the existing lenders or the majority
shareholder. In considering our forecast for the next twelve months and the current cash and working capital as of the filing of this
Form 10-Q, such matters create a substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to meet its financial needs and continue as a
going concern. 

These financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities
that might result from this uncertainty. 

and , respectively; and there was allowance for uncollectible other receivables. Management believes that
the remaining accounts receivable and other receivables are collectable.

As of September 30, 2024 and December

and prepayments, other payables and accrued liabilities, and balances with related parties approximated the carrying values of these instruments
presented in the Company s consolidated balance sheets due to the short maturities of these instruments. 

In addition, the arrangement generally
includes customer acceptance criteria that cannot be tested before installation and integration at the customer s site. Accordingly,
revenue recognition is deferred until customer acceptance, indicated by an acceptance certificate signed off by the customer. 

We recognize revenue over time when
there is a continuous transfer of control to our customer. When control is transferred over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent
of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Based on the nature of the products and services provided in the contract,
we use our judgment to determine if an input measure or output measure best depicts the transfer of control over time. If a contract does
not meet the criteria for recognizing revenue over time, we recognize revenue at a point in time. 

Revenues of maintenance services are
recognized when the services are performed in accordance with the contract term. For maintenance service contracts, a time-elapsed output
method is used to measure progress, and revenue is recognized straight-line over the term of the contract. 

For services contracts, we typically
satisfy our performance obligations as services are rendered and use a contract cost-based input method to measure progress. Contract
costs include labor, material and allocable indirect expenses. Revenue is recognized proportionally as contract costs are incurred plus
estimated fees. 

Revenues of sale of software, if not
bundled with other arrangements, are recognized when shipped and customer acceptance obtained at a point in time, if all other revenue
recognition criteria are met. Costs associated with revenues are recognized when incurred. 

Revenues are recorded net of value-added
taxes, sales discounts and returns. There were no sales returns during the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

any Advance under the 2023 Credit Agreement 1.

1. In the event that the Company breaches any provision of the 2023 Credit Agreement 1 and does not remedy that breach within thirty
(30) days after receipt of a written demand from a Lender (unless a different cure period is stated for that specific breach), then each
of the Lenders may convert all or any portion of the unpaid amount of their respective Advance or Advances into shares of Company Common
Stock at the Conversion Price 1. 

Warrants. In the event that a Lender elects
to convert any portion of an Advance under the 2023 Credit Agreement 1 into shares of Company Common Stock in lieu of cash payment in
satisfaction of that Advance, then Company will issue to the Lender five (5) detachable warrants for each share of Company Common Stock
issued in a Conversion of Convertible Loan 1 Warrants 1 ). Each Warrant 1 will entitle the Lender to purchase one (1) share
of Common Stock at a per-share exercise price equal to the Conversion Price 1. The exercise period of each Warrant will be five (5) years
from date of issuance of the Warrant.

The calculation of our tax liabilities
involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our
global operations. ASC 740 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not
that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis
of the technical merits. We (1) record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and (2) adjust these liabilities
when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some
of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the
unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period
in which new information is available.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW 

History of Value Exchange International, Inc. 

Organization. 

 We were incorporated in the
State of Nevada on June 26, 2007. Our Common Stock s trading symbol is VEII. Our common stock was quoted on the OTCQB
Venture Market until July 1, 2024. Due to failure to file the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and Form 10-Q for
the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, with the Commission by July 1, 2024, the OTC Markets Group downgraded the Common Stock to Pink
Sheets Limited Information as of July 2, 2024. On July 29, 2024, the Common Stock was returned to quotation on the OTC QB Venture Market
after the Company filed the aforementioned reports with the Commission and updated its OTC Certification. 

Current Business Focus . 

 We are a provider of customer-centric
technology solutions for the retail industry in Hong Kong SAR and certain regions of China, Philippines and Malaysia. After acquisition
of a Malaysia company in 2024, our market reach expanded to Malaysia. 

45 

By integrating market-leading
Point-of-Sale/Point-of-Interaction POS/POI ), Merchandising, Customer Relations Management or CRM and related
rewards, Locational Based (GPS Indoor Positioning System IPS )) Marketing, Customer Analytics, Business Intelligence
solutions, our products and services are intended to provide retailers with the capability to offer a consistent shopping experience across
all channels, enabling them to easily and effectively manage the customer lifecycle on a one-to-one basis. We promote ourselves as a single
IT source for retailers who want to extend existing traditional transaction processing to multiple points of interaction, including the
Internet, kiosks and wireless devices. Our products and services are focused on helping retailers realize the full benefits of Customer
Chain Management with its suite of solutions that focus on the customer, on employees, and the infrastructure that supports the selling
channel. Company is headquartered in Hong Kong and with offices in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, China; Manila, Philippines;
and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

We believe that the IT Business
often presents opportunities to expand a provider s market reach or customer base by acquisitions of existing businesses or operating
assets. The Company s business strategy includes reviewing possible acquisitions of existing businesses or operating assets in existing
or adjacent markets and to do so when and if such an acquisition appears to be compatible and an enhancement of our core business lines
and can be consummated with available cash and other resources. Our ability to pursue and consummate acquisitions may be limited, and
has been limited, by available cash for mergers and acquisitions and other resources and the perceived cost and burdens of acquiring and
integrating the target business or new operating assets into our operations. The availability of funding and cash flow are the most significant
limitations on our ability to expand through acquisitions of businesses and assets both in terms of money on hand and ability
to finance acquisitions, but the estimated business hurdles in successfully penetrating a new market is also a factor in deciding whether
to proceed with that expansion. The limited liquidity and bid price of our Common Stock in the public stock market also hampers our ability
to use shares of Common Stock as attractive consideration to target companies in a merger or acquisition. We have not expanded into any
new markets by acquisition or otherwise during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

The Company, through its operating
subsidiaries, is focusing and will focus on its IT Business, and continue to seek to expand its IT Business services to commercial customers
in PRC and Asia Pacific Region. This strategy is based upon our subjective business judgment that the IT Business presents more opportunities
for potential customer order in our core markets of Hong Kong SAR and China than other business lines and presents an industry segment
that better suits our current technical capabilities, marketing capabilities and financial resources. 

Initial Business Focus . 

 Our initial intended, primary
business was to operate a credit card processing and merchant-acquiring services company that provide credit card clearing services to
merchants and financial institutions in PRC. From inception, we strove unsuccessfully to create and establish a proposed Global Processing
Platform concept to support the credit card processing services SinoPay GPP ). Specifically, the Company s Internet
Protocol business was to be a provider of Internet Protocol IP processing services in Asia to bank card-accepting merchants IP Business ). The Company efforts to establish a viable IP Business did not succeed. The acquisition of VEI CHN in 2014
shifted the primary business focus to the IT Business. Company believes that the IT Business provided a more readily attainable revenue
generating business line and greater growth and profit potential than IP Business. VEI CHN was acquired in a stock-for-stock exchange VEI CHN Share Exchange ). 

Industry Trends and Economic Conditions . 

The IT Business in Hong Kong
and China is large and fragmented, comprised of thousands of competitors as well as being a highly competitive industry. Similar competition
exists in other Asian markets that the Company may conduct business or seek to engage in business. A general trend affecting our IT Business
is the trend of increasing competition for skilled labor. With a global economy and foreign competitors seeking to penetrate Hong Kong
and China as markets as well as to tap into new pools of skilled workers in IT Business, we will undoubtedly face increasing competition
for skilled workers in IT Business in the Hong Kong and China markets and in other markets that we may seek to establish operations. We
may be unable to afford or effectively compete for necessary skilled workers in Hong Kong, Philippines, Malaysia and China and, if we
are unable to afford or effectively compete for necessary skilled workers, our growth and ability to attain and sustain profit operations
in the IT Business may fail. We have not experienced any significant problems in recruiting necessary skilled workers in fiscal years
2023 or 2024 to date of the filing of this Form 10-Q. 

46 

Another common problem in
the IT Business is retaining skilled workers throughout the duration of a project. Due to the global nature of the IT Business and the
growing demand for skilled IT Business workers, a skilled IT business worker can often readily find higher paying positions with competitors,
whether local or foreign. Further, unlike some competitors, the Company has not offered the stock-based incentive compensation to employees
that is attractive to prospective technology workers. While we have not experienced retention problems due primarily to our focus on smaller,
shorter term IT business projects, we may experience retention of skilled worker problems if we grow our IT Business and undertake longer
term, more complex IT business projects for customers. 

IT Business is often affected
by general economic conditions in our markets and any decline in those conditions could adversely impact our business and financial performance.
During periods of economic growth, customers generally spend more for IT Business products and services. During periods of economic contraction
or uncertainty, such spending generally decreases or is deferred. As such, the prospective business for our IT Business is generally greater
during periods of economic growth or stability in Hong Kong or China or Manila, Philippines, respectively, and decreases during periods
of economic decline or uncertainty in Hong Kong, China or Manila, Philippines. In our global economy, and with PRC being still a principal
export economy, adverse economic conditions globally or in other regions can adversely impact economic conditions in Hong Kong or China.
China has experienced a less dynamic growth in gross national product in the past year and this may reduce the willingness of customers
to spend on IT Business. Our operating experience in Malaysia may face similar challenges. 

The IT Business is global
and, with the growth of cloud computing, there is a growing capability and infrastructure for companies in a foreign nation to provide
IT Business to customers around the globe as a complement to cloud computing. We have not seen any significant impact of cloud computing
on our IT Business in fiscal years 2023 or fiscal year 2024 to date, but we perceive that the expansion of cloud computing coupled with
IT services and products could allow foreign companies to provide IT Business products and services to its cloud computing customers in
our Hong Kong and China core markets as well as in the Philippines and Malaysia. We may find it more difficult to compete for IT Business
in Hong Kong and China, and perhaps the Philippines, if customers of IT Business elect to have cloud computing companies manage, repair
and enhance IT Business products, software and systems. The growth of cloud computing coupled with IT Business products and services as
an ancillary component of the cloud computing menu of products and services could adversely impact our IT Business in Hong Kong and China
markets as well as the Philippines and Malaysia. 

The nature of our IT Business
is such that our accounts receivable is significant current asset. Our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs,
which are generally paid either every two weeks or monthly. If the demand for our IT Business products and services increases, we may
generally see an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our workers on a weekly or monthly basis while the related
accounts receivable are outstanding for much longer than normal payment cycle, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows.
Conversely, as the demand for our IT Business products and services declines, we may generally see a decrease in our working capital needs,
as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable
balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. This may result in
an increase in our operating cash flows; however, any such increase would not be sustainable in the event that a local or global economic
downturn continued for an extended period. 

In order for us to attain
sustained success in the near term, we must continue to maintain and grow our customer base, provide high-quality service and satisfy
our existing clients, and take advantage of opportunities in the IT Business. In the current economic environment, we must provide our
customers with service offerings that are appropriately priced, satisfy their needs, and provide them with measurable business benefits.
While we have recently experienced more demand for our IT Business products and services, we believe that it is too early to determine
if developments will translate into sustainable improvements in our pricing or margins in fiscal year 2024 or over the longer term. 

The increasing need for cybersecurity
products and technologies may be a future weakness of our business plan. We do not have a current cybersecurity product and service business
line beyond consultants engaged to provide cybersecurity services to customers and we have not current plans to develop a cybersecurity
business line. Cybersecurity companies may have an advantage over our business model in the future in that cybersecurity companies could
leverage their cybersecurity offerings to also sell IT Business services and products that compete with our IT Business products and services. 

47 

We face competition from competitors
in our primary markets, which competitors possess greater name recognition, assets, personnel, sales and financial resources. These entities
may be able to respond more quickly to changing market conditions by developing new products and services that meet customer requirements
or are otherwise superior to our products and services and may be able to more effectively market their products than we can because they
have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. They may also be able to devote greater resources
than we can to the development, promotion and sale of their services and products. To the extent that we are unable to successfully compete
against existing and future competitors, our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.

three months ended September 30, 2024 was 591,660 or 13.5 of net revenues, as compared to 634,746 or 21.4 of net revenues, for the
same period in 2023, a decrease of 43,086 or 6.8 . The increase of gross profit was largely due to the increase in net revenues, and
offset by the increase in cost of services compared to the same period of 2023. 

General and administrative expenses .
General and administrative expenses include the costs associated with staff and support personnel who manage our business activities,
office rental expenses, depreciation charge for fixed assets, and professional fees paid to third parties. General and administrative
expenses increased to 1,164,668 or 26.5 of net revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 886,442 or 29.9 
of net revenues, for the same period in 2023, an increase of 278,226 or 31.4 . The primary reason for the increase was attributable to
the increase in audit fee, staff cost and other administrative costs. 

50 

Loss from operations . As a result
of the above, our loss from operations totaled 430,656 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 234,151 for the
same period in 2023, a decrease of 196,505 or 83.9 . 

Income taxes expenses. Income taxes
expenses totaled 204 or 0.005 of net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to income taxes expenses totaled
 4,134 or 0.1 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 3,930 or 95.1 . The decrease was primarily attributable to the movement in
profit tax paid for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net loss . As a result of the foregoing,
we had a net loss of 521,660 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 326,955 for the same period in 2023, an increase
of 194,705 or 59.6 , as a result of the factors described above.

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was 514,405
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was a change of 853,695 from 1,368,100 for the same period of 2023. The decrease
in net cash used in operating activities was mainly attributable to the following: 

1) A change of Accounts receivable, Amounts due to related parties, and Other receivables and prepayments
increased our operating cash balances by 712,411, 345,743 and 189,412 respectively; offset by 

2) Net loss of 480,640 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss of 1,121,719
for the same period in 2023; and 

3) A change of Amounts due to related parties, Accounts payable, Other payables and accrued liabilities,
and Deferred income decreased our operating cash balances by 693,081, 182,358, 625,675 and 524,183. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was 45,833
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was an increase of 14,922 or 48.3 from 30,911 in the same period in 2023. The decrease
in net cash used in investing activities was attributable to cash used in the purchase of plant and equipment by 106,188; offset by cash
received during acquisition of a subsidiary by 60,355, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was
 88,417 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was a decrease of 1,319,004 from 1,407,421 in the same period in 2023. The
decrease in net cash used in financing activities was attributable to cash received from the proceeds from convertible loan by 110,000
offset by cash used during the repayment of finance lease liability by 21,583 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Future Financings 

We believe that our cash on hand and cash flow
from operations will meet our expected capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the next 12 months. However, we may in
the future require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions, implementation of our strategy to expand our production
capacity, sales, marketing and branding activities or other investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our own financial
resources are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit
facilities. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would
result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our
operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds
on terms favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 

53 

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies
and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in note 2 of the notes
to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals,
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from
those estimates made by management. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ),
and include the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries that require consolidation. All material intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation. The Company s fiscal year end is December 31st. The following entities were

Use of Estimates 

Preparing consolidated financial statements in
conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. The more significant areas requiring using management s estimates and assumptions relate to the collectability
of its receivables, the fair value and accounting treatment of financial instruments, the valuation of long-lived assets and valuation
of deferred tax liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. In addition, different
assumptions or circumstances could reasonably be expected to yield different results. 

Plant and equipment 

Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred.
Major additions are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed
from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of plant and equipment is provided using the
straight-line method for substantially all assets with estimated lives as follows:

Revenue recognition 

The Company s revenue is derived from three
primary sources: (i) professional services for systems development and integration, including procurement of related hardware and software
licenses on behalf of customers, if required; (ii) professional services for system maintenance normally for a period of one year; and
(iii) sale of hardware and consumables during the service performed as stated above. We recognize revenue from contracts with customers
using the five-step model prescribed in ASC 606. 

The Company derives revenue from fixed-price sale
contracts with customers that may provide for the Company to procure hardware and software licenses with varied performance specifications
specific to each customer and provide the technical services for systems development and integration of the hardware and software licenses.
In instances where the contract price is inclusive of the technical services, the sale contracts include performance obligations. 

Determining whether such products and services
within a customer contract are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires significant
judgment. Accordingly, we review customer contracts to identify all separate promises to transfer goods and services that would be considered
performance obligations. Judgment is also required in determining whether an option to acquire additional products and services within
a customer contract represents a material right that the customer would not receive without entering into that contract. 

The Company s contracts often contain multiple
performance obligations, which generally include customer-acceptance provisions which provide for the Company to carry out installation,
test runs and performance tests at the Company s cost until the systems as a whole can meet the performance specifications stated
in the contracts. The delivered equipment and software licenses have no standalone value to the customer until they are installed, integrated
and tested at the customer s site by the Company in accordance with the performance specifications specific to each customer. In
addition, under these multiple performance obligations contracts, the Company has not sold the equipment and software licenses separately
from the installation, integration and testing services, and hence there is no objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for each
deliverable included in the arrangement. If a contract contains multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for each distinct
performance obligation separately. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative stand-alone
selling price basis. Any discounts or expected potential future price concessions are considered when determining the total transaction
price. 

In addition, the arrangement generally includes
customer acceptance criteria that cannot be tested before installation and integration at the customer s site. Accordingly, revenue
recognition is deferred until customer acceptance, indicated by an acceptance certificate signed off by the customer. 

We recognize revenue over time when there is a
continuous transfer of control to our customer. When control is transferred over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress
towards completion of the performance obligation. Based on the nature of the products and services provided in the contract, we use our
judgment to determine if an input measure or output measure best depicts the transfer of control over time. If a contract does not meet
the criteria for recognizing revenue over time, we recognize revenue at a point in time. 

Revenues of maintenance services are recognized
when the services are performed in accordance with the contract term. For maintenance service contracts, a time-elapsed output method
is used to measure progress, and revenue is recognized straight-line over the term of the contract. 

55 

For services contracts, we typically satisfy our
performance obligations as services are rendered and use a contract cost-based input method to measure progress. Contract costs include
labor, material and allocable indirect expenses. Revenue is recognized proportionally as contract costs are incurred plus estimated fees. 

Revenues of sale of software, if not bundled with
other arrangements, are recognized when shipped and customer acceptance obtained at a point in time, if all other revenue recognition
criteria are met. Costs associated with revenues are recognized when incurred. 

Revenues are recorded net of value-added taxes, sales discounts and
returns. There were no sales returns during the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred
revenue. 

Income taxes 

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The charge for taxation is based on the results for the
reporting period as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or
all of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

For uncertainty in income taxes, a tax position
is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination,
with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely
of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded.
Penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the year incurred. 

Stock-based Compensation 

The Company records stock-based compensation in
accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services
are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received
or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the
cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. 

Company adopted a 2022 Equity Incentive Plan in
2024, but has not granted or issued any stock based incentive compensation under this plan as of the date of filing this Form 10-Q report.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk 

As a smaller reporting
company as defined by Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this
Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and
with the participation of the Company s management, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act were not effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024, which were identified in connection with management s evaluation
required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Because the Company is a smaller reporting company,
this Form 10-Q does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

I tem 1. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may become involved in various
lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties,
and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of
any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating
results. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q, the Company is no longer
a Commission Identified Issuer under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act HFCAA ). 

As discussed in Note 2b on page 12 of this report,
management has evaluated the significance of the conditions in relation to the Company s ability to meet its obligations and believes
that its current cash balance along with its current operations will not provide sufficient capital to continue as a going concern. There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to generate or obtain sufficient capital to remedy this going concern issue. 

Risk factors for our company are set forth in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year end December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K) and other filings with the Commission.
The risks described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do
not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently
consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be
a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.
The Risk Factors section of the 2023 Form 10-K, as amended, remains current in all material respects. 

As reported in our 2023 Form 10-K, the Company
was unable to file the 2023 Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, in the period permitted under Commission
rules and OTC Market Group rules, and, as a result, the Common Stock of the Company was downgraded to Pink Sheet Limited Information from
OTC QB Venture Market from July 1, 2024 until July 29, 2024. On July 29, 2029, the Common Stock was returned to quotation on the OTC QB
Venture Market after the aforementioned reports were filed with the Commission and the Company updated its OTC Certification. Fiscal year
2023 was the first year that the Company had a U.S. based public auditor and adjusting to the requirements and testing/review of the U.S.
public auditor took longer than anticipated by the Company. The Company anticipates that the fiscal year 2023 audit experience will aid
the Company in efforts to avoid any late filings with the Commission for the fiscal year 2024 and remainder of fiscal year 2023. 

The Company s need to increase operating
profits and secure adequate, affordable working capital funding remains significant risk factors to sustaining or growing operations.
The Company is endeavoring to improve internal controls and systems and communications with its public auditors to ensure timely filing
of all required filings with the Commission and maintenance of the Company s Common Stock on the OTC QB Venture Markets. Having
the Common Stock downgraded to Pink Sheet Limited Information and late filings with the Commission, along with the shares of Common Stock
being a penny stock and the lack of primary market maker support for the shares of Common Stock, substantially decrease the
appeal of the Common Stock to investors and funding sources and investors and funding sources confidence in the Company
and its future prospects. The increase in operating revenues and profits, securing affordable, adequate working capital and avoidance
of late filings with the Commission and avoidance of the Common Stock being downgraded to Pink Sheet tiers are all critical challenges
to sustaining and growing operations. The failure to succeed in meeting these challenges raises the prospect of reduced or failed operations. 

There have been no other material changes to the
risk factors set forth in Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K.
