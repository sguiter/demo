EXPLANATORY NOTE 

Internal Control Considerations 
 
 Management has reassessed its evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, as further described in Part I, Item 4 of this Amendment, and concluded that a material weakness existed and that internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2023. 
 Items Amended in this Filing 
 This Amendment amends and restates the sections of the Original Report listed below, with modifications as necessary to reflect the effects of the restatement of our previously issued condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2023. No attempt has been made in this Amendment to update other disclosures presented in the Original Report, except as required to reflect the effects of such restatement in the following amended items: 
 Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements 

Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Part II, Item 6. Exhibits 

This Amendment also deletes certain non-GAAP financial measures (as defined in applicable SEC regulations). Specifically, the following non-GAAP financial measures that were originally included in Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Original Report have been removed: 
 Non-GAAP adjusted income from operations; 

2 

Non-GAAP adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share; and 

Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. 

Historically, the Company provided non-GAAP adjusted income from operations, non-GAAP adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures to GAAP measures regarding our operating performance because we believed these non-GAAP measures were helpful to investors in providing a comparison of our financial results between periods that more accurately reflects how management reviewed its financial results. However, starting from the quarterly report for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company stopped providing these non-GAAP financial measures in periodic reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Company does not intend to include in future filings the non-GAAP financial measures originally included in the Original Report. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that it is advisable to delete these non-GAAP financial measures from this Amendment. 
 Except as it relates to the restatement described above and related disclosures as well as the deletion of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, this Amendment does not reflect events occurring after the date of the Original Report. Among other things, forward looking statements made in the Original Report have not been revised to reflect events that occurred or facts that became known to the Company after the filing of the Original Report, and such forward looking statements should be read in their historical context. As such, this Amendment speaks only as of the date the Original Report was filed, and the Company has not undertaken herein to amend, supplement or update any information contained in the Original Report to give effect to any subsequent events. Accordingly, this Amendment should be read in conjunction with the Company s filings made with the SEC subsequent to the filing of the Original Report, including any amendment to those filings. 
 The exhibit list included in Part II, Item 6. Exhibits herein has been amended to contain currently dated certifications from the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and filed as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2 and 32. 
 In accordance with applicable SEC rules, this Amendment also includes an updated signature page.

 million one-time cash payment (the Payment ), which was received in April 2023. At the time of cancellation, no product units had been delivered under the Cancelled PO s and the Company had two other purchase orders from the same customer for the same product Open PO s ). The Company originally accounted for the Cancelled PO s as a single contract and recognized the million payment as component of product revenue in the first quarter of 2023. Subsequent to the issuance of the Original Report, the Company reassessed the accounting treatment of the Payment and concluded that the Cancelled PO s and Open PO s represented a combined contract such that the February 2023 transaction should have been analyzed and accounted for as a contract modification, which required the Payment to be deferred and recognized as product units were delivered under the Open PO s. All Open PO product units were fully delivered to the customer by June 30, 2024. The correction of the Misstatement affects certain financial statement line items in these condensed consolidated financial statements including but not limited to product revenues, income tax provision, foreign currency translation, deferred revenues, prepaid expenses, deferred taxes and earnings-per-share. Consolidated Financial Statements - Restatement Reconciliation Tables The following tables present the impact of the financial statement adjustments on the Company's previously reported condensed consolidated financial statements. The "Previously Reported" amounts in the following tables are amounts derived from the Original Report. The amounts in the columns labeled "Revenue Adjustments" represent the effect of adjustments resulting from the correction of the overstatement of revenues associated with the Payment and related tax impact. The amounts in the columns labeled "Other Adjustments" represent the effect of other adjustments that relate to other unrelated errors in previously filed financial statements that were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to those filed financial statements. The effects of both the restatement for the Revenue Adjustments and the immaterial Other Adjustments have been corrected in all impacted tables and footnotes throughout these condensed consolidated financial statements.

 Fair Value Measured on a Nonrecurring Basis During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 , there were no re-measurements to the fair value of financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 

 , the Company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests in FlexBiosys, Inc. ("FlexBiosys"), pursuant to an Equity Purchase Agreement ("EPA") with FlexBiosys, TSAP Holdings Inc. ("NJ Seller"), Gayle Tarry and Stanley Tarry, as individuals (collectively with NJ Seller, the "Sellers"), and Stanley Tarry, in his capacity as the representative of the Sellers (the "FlexBiosys Acquisition"). FlexBiosys, which is headquartered in Branchburg, New Jersey, offers expert design and custom manufacturing of single-use bioprocessing products and a comprehensive range of products that include bioprocessing bags, bottles, and tubing assemblies. These products will complement and expand our fluid management portfolio of offerings. Consideration transferred The FlexBiosys Acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a business under ASC 805, "Business Combinations," and the Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist with the valuation of FlexBiosys. Under the terms of the EPA, all outstanding equity interests of FlexBiosys were acquired for consideration with a value totaling million. The FlexBiosys Acquisition was funded through payment of million in cash, which includes million deposited in escrow for future payments, the issuance of unregistered shares of the Company's common stock totaling million and contingent consideration with fair value of approximately million. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of FlexBiosys were recorded as of the acquisition date, at their respective fair values, and consolidated with those of the Company. The fair value of the net assets acquired is estimated to be million, the fair value of the intangible assets acquired is estimated to be million and the residual goodwill is estimated to be million. The estimated consideration and preliminary purchase price information has been prepared using a preliminary valuation. Acquisition-related costs are not included as a component of consideration transferred but are expensed in the periods in which costs are incurred. The Company has incurred million of transaction and integration costs associated with the FlexBiosys Acquisition from the date of acquisition to June 30, 2023. The transaction costs are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.

Total revenue 

When disaggregating revenue, the Company considered all of the economic factors that may affect its revenues. Because substantially all of its revenues are from bioprocessing customers, there are no differences in the nature, timing and uncertainty of the Company s revenues and cash flows from any of its product lines. However, given that the Company s revenues are generated in different geographic regions, regulatory, economic and geopolitical factors within those regions could impact the nature, timing and uncertainty of the Company s revenues and cash flows. In addition, a significant portion of the Company s revenue is generated from a small number of customers; therefore, economic factors specific to these customers could impact the nature, timing and uncertainty of the Company s revenues and cash flows. Disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by geographic region and revenue from significant customers can be found in Note 14, Segment Reporting, included in this report. For more information regarding our product revenue, see Note 6, Revenue Recognition included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data to our Form 10-K.

The Company s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 was and , respectively, compared to and for the corresponding periods in the prior year. The difference in effective tax rates between the periods was primarily due to lower income before taxes and increased benefits from business tax credits partially offset by nondeductible contingent consideration and lower foreign-derived intangible income. On August 16, 2022, the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("Inflation Reduction Act"), which, among other things, implements a alternative minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, a excise tax on net stock repurchases and several tax incentives to promote clean energy and was effective beginning in 2023. We evaluated the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act and no provision had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, shares and shares, respectively, of the Company s common stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the exercise prices of the stock options were greater than or equal to the average price of the common shares and were therefore anti-dilutive. Comparatively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, shares and shares, respectively, were considered anti-dilutive.

million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes. As provided by the terms of the indenture underlying the 2019 Notes, prior to March 4, 2022, conversion of the 2019 Notes could have been settled in cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company s election. On March 4, 2022, we entered into the Second Supplemental Indenture for the 2019 Notes, which irrevocably elected to settle the conversion of the 2019 Notes using a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock, settling the par value of the 2019 Notes in cash and any excess conversion premium in shares. As provided by the terms of the Second Supplemental Indenture underlying the 2019 Notes, the Company irrevocably elected to settle the conversion obligation for the 2019 Notes in a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock. This means the Company will settle the par value of the 2019 Notes in cash and any excess conversion premium in shares. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2022. Under ASU 2020-06, the Company is required to reflect the dilutive effect of the convertible securities by application of the "if-converted" method, which means the denominator of the EPS calculation would include the total number of shares assuming the 2019 Notes had been fully converted at the beginning of the period. Prior to March 4, 2022, the Company had the choice to settle the conversion of the 2019 Notes in cash, stock or a combination of the two. Therefore, from January 1, 2022 (the date the Company adopted ASU 2020-06) to March 4, 2022, the Company included shares in the denominator of the EPS calculation, applying the if converted method. Subsequent to March 4, 2022, after the Second Supplemental Indenture became effective, the Company irrevocably elected to settle the conversion obligation for the 2019 Notes in a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, and from March 5, 2022 forward, only the excess premium will be settled with shares. Under the if-converted method of calculating dilutive shares, the Company was also required to exclude amortization of debt issuance costs and interest charges applicable to the convertible debt from the numerator of the dilutive EPS calculation for the period from January 1, 2022 to March 4, 2022, as if the interest on convertible debt was never recognized for that period. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company excluded interest charges of million (net of tax) from the numerator. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company applied the provisions of ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, Subsection 10-45-44, to determine the diluted weighted average shares outstanding as it related to the conversion spread on its convertible notes. Accordingly, the par value of the 2019 Notes was not included in the calculation of diluted income per share, but the dilutive effect of the conversion premium was considered in the calculation of diluted net income per share using the treasury stock method. The dilutive impact of the 2019 Notes was based on the difference between the Company s current period average stock price and the conversion price of the 2019 Notes, provided there was a premium. Pursuant to this accounting standard, there was no dilution from the accreted principal of the 2019 Notes. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the dilutive effect of the conversion premium included in the calculation of diluted earnings was shares and shares, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the dilutive effect of the conversion premium included in the calculation of diluted earnings was shares and shares, respectively.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers (As Restated) Financial instruments that subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. Per the Company s investment policy, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in financial instruments with high credit ratings and credit exposure to any one issue, issuer (with the exception of U.S. Treasury obligations) and type of instrument is limited. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had no investments associated with foreign exchange contracts, options contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to customers to whom the Company makes significant sales. While a reserve for the potential write-off of accounts receivable is maintained, the Company has not written off any significant accounts to date. To control credit risk, the Company performs regular credit evaluations of its customers financial condition. There was revenue from customers that represented or more of the Company's total revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Overview 
 Repligen and its subsidiaries, collectively doing business as Repligen Corporation Repligen , we , our , or the Company is a global life sciences company that develops and commercializes highly innovative bioprocessing technologies and systems that increase efficiencies and flexibility in the process of manufacturing biological drugs. 
 As the overall market for biologics continues to grow and expand, our customers primarily large biopharmaceutical companies and contract development and manufacturing organizations and other life sciences companies (integrators) face critical production cost, capacity, quality and time pressures. Built to address these concerns, our products help set new standards for the way biologics are manufactured. We are committed to inspiring advances in bioprocessing as a trusted partner in the production of critical biologic drugs including monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, vaccines and cell and gene therapies that are improving human health worldwide. Increasingly, our technologies are being implemented to overcome challenges in processing plasmid DNA (a starting material for the production of mRNA) and gene delivery vectors such as lentivirus and adeno-associated viral vectors. For more information regarding our business, products and acquisitions, see Part I, Item 1, Business included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K Form 10-K ), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 22, 2023. 
 We currently operate as one bioprocessing business, with a comprehensive suite of products to serve both upstream and downstream processes in biological drug manufacturing. Building on over 40 years of industry expertise, we have developed a broad and diversified product portfolio that reflects our passion for innovation and the customer-first culture that drives our entire organization. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to maximize the value of our product platform through both organic growth initiatives (internal innovation and commercial leverage) and targeted acquisitions. 
 Restatement 
 As previously described in the Explanatory Note above and in Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we have restated our previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes as of June 30, 2023 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. As a result, the previously reported financial information as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 in this Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been updated to reflect the restatement. Refer to Note 1 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the restatement, including descriptions of the adjustments and the impacts on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Other than the effect of the restatement and revisions made to correct immaterial errors as described in Note 1 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, this section has not been otherwise modified and does not reflect any information or events occurring after August 2, 2023, the filing date of the Original Report, or modify or update those disclosures affected by events that occurred at a later date or facts that subsequently became known to the Company, except to the extent they are otherwise required to be included and discussed herein. 
 Macroeconomic Trends 
 As a result of our global presence, a significant portion of our revenue and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are therefore subject to non-U.S. exchange exposure. Exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening or strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could increase or reduce our revenue and gross profit margin and impact the comparability of results from period to period. 
 We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cost inflation, primarily in raw materials, and other supply chain costs, as a result of global macroeconomic trends, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and labor shortages. Actions taken to mitigate supply chain disruptions and inflation, including price increases and productivity improvements, have generally been successful in offsetting the impact of these trends. In addition, decreasing demand for COVID-19 vaccinations is driving a reduction 
 28 

in future demand of our products related to these vaccines. We expect that these trends will continue to impact our results for significant part of 2023. 
 2023 Acquisition 
 Acquisition of FlexBiosys, Inc. 
 On April 17, 2023, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests in FlexBiosys, Inc. ("FlexBiosys"), pursuant to an Equity Purchase Agreement ("EPA") with FlexBiosys, TSAP Holdings Inc. ("NJ Seller"), Gayle Tarry and Stanley Tarry, as individuals (collectively with NJ Seller, the "Sellers"), and Stanley Tarry, in his capacity as the representative of the Sellers. 
 FlexBiosys, which is headquartered in Branchburg, New Jersey, offers expert design and custom manufacturing of single-use bioprocessing products and a comprehensive range of products that include bioprocessing bags, bottles, and tubing assemblies. These products will complement and expand our fluid management portfolio of offerings. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 A critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For a description of our critical accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our significant accounting policies in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", to the consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K. 
 Results of Operations 
 The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes thereto.

Product revenues (As Restated) 
 Since 2016, we have been increasingly focused on selling our products directly to customers in the pharmaceutical industry and to our contract manufacturers. These direct sales represented approximately 84.7 and 89.2 of our product revenue for each of the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and represented 83.6 and 88.1 of our product revenue for each of the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales of our bioprocessing products can be impacted by the timing of large-scale production orders and the regulatory approvals for such antibodies, which may result in significant quarterly fluctuations. 
 Revenues from our filtration franchise include the sales of our XCell ATF systems and consumables; Spectrum filtration systems, including KrosFlo SIUS filtration products and systems; the fluid management assemblies and components offered by Engineered Molding Technology LLC, Non-Metallic Solutions, Inc., ARTeSYN Biosolutions Ireland Limited ("ARTeSYN"), BioFlex and FlexBiosys; the hollow fiber membrane technology offered by Polymem, and our ARTeSYN filtration systems. Revenue from our chromatography products includes the sale of our OPUS pre-packed chromatography columns, ELISA test kits and chromatography systems from Spectrum and ARTeSYN. Revenue from proteins products includes the sale of our Protein A ligands and cell culture growth factors, and sales of affinity products, including adeno-associated virus resins offered by Avitide. 
 29 

Revenue from our process analytics products includes the sale of our SoloVPE , FlowVPE and FlowVPX systems, consumables and service. Other revenue primarily consists of sales of our operating room products to hospitals as well as freight revenue. 
 During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, product revenue decreased by 48.5 million, or 23.3 , and 89.5 million, or 21.6 , respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2022. This is mainly due to a decrease in revenue from programs related to COVID-19 as customers continue to repurpose inventory initially purchased for COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines. This primarily affected our filtration products. There was also an unfavorable impact on changes in foreign exchange rates during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods of 2022. Partially offsetting these revenue declines were increases from price increases and strong performances within the Chromatography and Process Analytics franchises during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods of 2022. Specifically, revenue from sale of large scale OPUS pre-packed chromatography columns, chromatography systems and flowpaths as well as slope spectroscopy systems, consumables and service. 
 Royalty revenues 
 Royalty revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 relate to royalties received from a third-party systems manufacturer associated with our OPUS PD chromatography columns. Royalty revenues are variable and are dependent on sales generated by our partners. 
 Costs of Product Revenue and Operating Expenses

 Cost of product revenue decreased 8.1 and 4.4 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2022, due primarily to the decrease in product revenue related to changes in the product mix and costs associated with lower product volume. Although we continue to manage our operating expenses, these decreases in product costs continue to be partially offset by cost inflation, primarily in raw materials as well as freight charges due to fuel costs and carrier market conditions during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the same periods of 2022. Also, our occupancy costs and depreciation expense increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods of 2022, due to expanded facilities and manufacturing equipment being placed into service throughout 2022 and 2023. 
 Gross margin was 50.2 and 58.5 in the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively and gross margin was 50.3 and 59.3 in the six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The reduction in gross margin in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods of 2022, is due primarily to lower overall sales and production volumes, and a change in product mix, where we saw a significant decline in revenue associated with higher-margin consumable products due to the decrease in COVID-19 vaccine demand. We also experienced an increase in manufacturing costs from an increase in occupancy costs due to added capacity, an increase in depreciation expense, and an increase in freight charges from cost inflation. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development R D expenses are related to bioprocessing products, which include personnel, supplies and other research expenses. Due to the fact that these various programs share personnel and fixed costs, we do not track all of our expenses or allocate any fixed costs by program, and therefore, have not provided historical costs incurred by project. 
 30 

R D expenses decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the same periods of 2022 primarily due to a decrease in employee-related costs during the periods from a decline in headcount since the end of the second quarter of 2022 partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to R D assets that were put into service. 
 R D expense also includes payments made to expand our proteins product offering through our development agreement with Navigo Proteins GmbH Navigo ). Such expenses were 1.2 million and 2.3 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to 0.7 million and 1.1 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2022, in the form of milestone payments to Navigo. 
 We expect our R D expenses for the remainder of 2023 to gradually increase to support new product development. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses (As Restated) 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses include the costs associated with selling our commercial products and costs required to support our marketing efforts, including legal, accounting, patent, shareholder services, amortization of intangible assets and other administrative functions. 
 During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, SG A costs decreased by 5.6 million, or 10.2 , and 3.6 million, or 3.3 , respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2022. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in employee-related costs since June 2022. The decrease is partially offset by the continued expansion of our customer-facing activities to drive sales of our bioprocessing products and to support expected future growth. 
 Contingent consideration 
 Contingent consideration expense (benefit) represents the change in fair value of the contingent consideration obligation included in current and noncurrent contingent consideration on the consolidated balance sheets as of the end of each period. Remeasurement of the contingent consideration obligation is done each quarter and the carrying value of the obligation is adjusted to the current fair value through our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. A change in market inputs used to calculate the discount rate resulted in a change to the expense (benefit) reported for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 of 1.8 million and 6.9) million, respectively, and 3.0 million and 9.3) million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Investment income 
 Investment income includes income earned on invested cash balances. Our investment income increased by 5.3 million and 10.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2022 due to an increase in interest rates on average invested cash balances since June 30, 2022, as well as interest earned on U.S. treasury bills purchased at the end of 2022. We expect investment income to vary based on changes in the amount of funds invested and fluctuation of interest rates. 
 Interest expense 
 31 

Interest expense in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 is primarily from our 0.375 Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2019 Notes ), which were issued in July 2019. Interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 includes the contractual coupon interest on the 2019 Notes. 
 Amortization of debt issuance costs 
 Transaction costs related to the issuance of the 2019 Notes and attributable to the liability component of the 2019 Notes are included in amortization of debt issuance costs on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
 Other expenses 
 The change in other expenses during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the same periods of 2022, is primarily attributable to realized foreign currency gains and losses related to transactions with customers and vendors. 
 Income Tax Provision (As Restated) 
 Income tax provision for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded an income tax provision of 5.1 million and 8.3 million, respectively. The effective tax rate was 20.6 and 19.2 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and is based upon the estimated income for the year ending December 31, 2023 and the composition of income in different jurisdictions. The difference in effective tax rates between the periods was primarily due to lower income before taxes and increased benefits from business tax credits partially offset by nondeductible contingent consideration and lower foreign-derived intangible income. Our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to business tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income and windfall benefits recognized on stock option exercises and the vesting of stock units. 
 For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded an income tax provision of 9.9 million and 21.9 million, respectively. The effective tax rate was 16.6 and 18.4 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and is based upon the estimated income for the year ending December 31, 2022 and the composition of income in different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to business tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income and windfall benefits on stock option exercise and the vesting of stock units. 
 On August 16, 2022, the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("Inflation Reduction Act"), which, among other things, implements a 15 alternative minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, a 1 excise tax on net stock repurchases and several tax incentives to promote clean energy and will become effective beginning in 2023. We evaluated the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act and no provision had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources (As Restated) 
 We have financed our operations primarily through revenues derived from product sales, the issuance of the 2019 Notes in July 2019 and the issuance of common stock in our December 2020, July 2019 and May 2019 public offerings. Our revenue for the foreseeable future will primarily be limited to our bioprocessing product revenue. 
 On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank SVB was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the FDIC as receiver. Subsequently, the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve and FDIC announced that SVB depositors would have access to all of their money. We have a banking relationship with SVB and hold cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of less than 0.1 million as of June 30, 2023 in SVB depository accounts to cover short-term operational payments. While we have not experienced any losses in such accounts, the recent failure of SVB caused us to utilize our accounts at other financial institutions in order to mitigate potential operational risks stemming from the temporary 
 32 

inability to access funds in our SVB operating accounts. As a result of bank failures, such as SVB, our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired and could negatively impact the financial institutions with which we have direct arrangements, or the financial services industry or economy in general. 
 At June 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 603.7 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of 523.5 million at December 31, 2022. 
 Working capital increased by 17.7 million to 611.6 million at June 30, 2023 from 593.9 million at December 31, 2022 due to the various changes noted below. 
 During the second quarter of 2023, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130 of the conversion price of the 2019 Notes for more than 20 trading days of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter. As a result, the 2019 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders of the 2019 Notes during the third quarter of 2023, the quarter immediately following the quarter when the conditions are met, as stated in the terms of the 2019 Notes. These conditions have been met each quarter since the third quarter of 2020. As a result, 0.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes have been requested for conversion by the note holders since the issuance of the 2019 Notes and all conversions have settled as of June 30, 2023 except 24,000 aggregate principal amount, which settles in the third quarter of 2023. The conversions resulted in the issuance of a nominal number of shares of our common stock to the noteholders. We continue to classify the carrying value of the 2019 Notes as current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2023.

Operating activities (As Restated) 
 For the six months ended June 30, 2023, our operating activities provided cash of 45.6 million reflecting net income of 35.1 million and non-cash charges totaling 51.4 million primarily related to depreciation, amortization, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation charges and operating lease right of use asset amortization. An increase in accounts receivable consumed 4.6 million of cash and was primarily driven by the timing of collections from customers. Additionally, we had an increase in inventory manufactured that consumed 2.5 million and a 12.9 million increase in prepaid expenses, primarily related to prepaid taxes and subscriptions. A decrease in accounts payable consumed 3.9 million and was due to the timing of payments to vendors. A decrease in accrued liabilities consumed 11.8 million primarily related to the payment of employee bonuses during the six months ended June 30, 2023. The remaining cash provided by operating activities resulted from favorable changes in various other working capital accounts. 
 For the six months ended June 30, 2022, our operating activities provided cash of 68.8 million reflecting net income of 96.8 million and non-cash charges totaling 34.0 million primarily related to depreciation, amortization, contingent consideration adjustments, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation charges and operating lease right of use asset amortization. An increase in accounts receivable consumed 8.4 million of cash and was primarily driven by the 35.4 year-to-date increase in revenues. Additionally, we had an increase in inventory manufactured of 58.1 million to support expected increases in future revenue. A decrease in accrued liabilities of 4.0 million relates to the payout of employee bonuses and a decrease in our estimated income tax provision during the first half of 2022. Offsetting these uses of cash was a 6.3 million increase in accounts payable which correlates to the increase in inventory and is also a result of the timing of payments to vendors and a decrease in prepaid expenses driven by a decrease in prepaid corporate income taxes. The remaining cash provided by operating activities resulted from favorable changes in various other working capital accounts. 
 Investing activities 
 33 

Our investing activities provided 55.4 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the maturity of our short-term investment in U.S. treasury securities in June 2023, which provided cash of 102.3 million. We used 28.1 million in cash (net of cash received) for the FlexBiosys Acquisition. Capital expenditures consumed 18.8 million in 2023 as we continue to increase our manufacturing capacity worldwide. Of these expenditures, 2.1 million represented capitalized costs related to our internal-use software for the six months ended June 30, 2023. 
 Our investing activities consumed 54.4 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2022 mainly due to capital expenditures as we continue to increase our manufacturing capacity worldwide. Of these expenditures, 1.9 million represented capitalized costs related to our internal-use software for the six months ended June 30, 2022. 
 Financing activities 
 Our financing activities consumed 18.4 million of cash for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily for 11.1 million in cash disbursed for shares withheld to cover employee income tax due upon the vesting and release of restricted stock units and the payment of 7.3 million to settle the cash portion of the First Earnout Year contingent earnout obligation related to our acquisition of Avitide, Inc. in September 2021. This was partially offset by proceeds received from stock option exercises during the period. 
 Our financing activities consumed 14.3 million of cash for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which included cash disbursed in relation to shares withheld to cover employee income taxes due upon the vesting and release of restricted stock units of 14.8 million. This was partially offset by proceeds received from stock option exercises during the period of 0.5 million. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the following: 
 the expansion of our bioprocessing business; 

the ability to sustain sales and profits of our bioprocessing products and successfully integrate them into our business; 

our ability to acquire additional bioprocessing products; 

the scope of and progress made in our R D activities; 

the scope of investment in our intellectual property portfolio; 

contingent consideration earnout payments resulting from our acquisitions; 

the extent of any share repurchase activity; 

the success of any proposed financing efforts; 

general economic and capital markets; 

change in accounting standards; 

the impact of inflation on our operations, including our expenditures on raw materials and freight charges; 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and 

costs associated with our ability to comply with, emerging environmental, social and governance standards. 

Absent acquisitions of additional products, product candidates or intellectual property, we believe our current cash balances are adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next 24 months from the date of this filing. We expect operating expenses for the rest of the year to increase as we continue to expand our bioprocessing business. We expect to incur continued spending related to the development and expansion of our bioprocessing product lines and expansion of our commercial capabilities for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements may include, but are not limited to, purchases of property, plant and equipment, the acquisition of additional bioprocessing products and technologies to complement our existing manufacturing capabilities and continued investment in our intellectual property portfolio. 
 We plan to continue to invest in our bioprocessing business and in key R D activities associated with the development of new bioprocessing products. We actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including acquiring products, technologies or businesses that would complement our existing portfolio. We continue to seek to acquire such potential assets that may offer us the best opportunity to create value for our shareholders. In order to acquire such assets, we may need to seek additional financing to fund these investments. If our available cash balances and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including because of any such acquisition-related financing needs or lower demand for our products, we may seek to sell common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter into a credit facility 
 34 

or another form of third-party funding, or seek other debt funding. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our shareholders, and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any other third-party funding arrangement could require us to relinquish valuable rights. We may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryforwards 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of 42.9 million, state net operating loss carryforwards of 0.8 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of 4.9 million. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of 7.3 million will expire at various dates through 2037. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2041, while the foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. The other 35.6 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards have unlimited carryforward periods. We had state business tax credits carryforwards of 3.8 million available to reduce future domestic income taxes. The state business tax credits carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2042. Net operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service, state and foreign tax authorities and may be limited in the event of certain changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders. 
 Effects of Inflation 
 Our assets are primarily monetary, consisting of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Because of their liquidity, these assets are not directly affected by inflation. Since we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment, furniture, fixtures and office equipment, computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements, we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as those for employee compensation and contract services, which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources. 
 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Amendment contains forward-looking statements which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The forward-looking statements in this Amendment do not constitute guarantees of future performance. Investors are cautioned that statements in this Amendment which are not strictly historical statements, including, without limitation, express or implied statements or guidance regarding current or future financial performance and position, potential impairment of future earnings, management s strategy, plans and objectives for future operations or acquisitions, product development and sales, restructuring activities, product candidate research, development and regulatory approval, SG A expenditures, intellectual property, development and manufacturing plans, availability of materials and product and adequacy of capital resources, our financing plans and the projected continued impact of, and response to, COVID-19 constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which the Company operates, and management s beliefs and assumptions. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise the statements in light of future developments. In addition, other written and oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements may be made by the Company or on the Company s behalf. Words such as expect, seek, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, could, estimate, may, target, project, or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, including, without limitation, risks associated with the following: the success of current and future collaborative or supply relationships, including our agreements with Cytiva, MilliporeSigma and Purolite Life Sciences, an Ecolab Inc. company; our ability to successfully grow our bioprocessing business, including as a result of acquisitions, commercialization or partnership opportunities, and our ability to develop and commercialize products; our ability to obtain required regulatory approvals; our compliance with all U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, our ability to obtain, maintain and protect intellectual property rights for our products; the risk of litigation regarding our patent and other intellectual property rights; the risk of litigation with collaborative partners; our manufacturing capabilities and our dependence on third-party manufacturers and value-added resellers; our ability to hire and retain skilled personnel; the market acceptance of our products, reduced demand for our products that adversely impacts our future revenues, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition; our ability to integrate acquired businesses successfully 
 35 

into our business and achieve the expected benefits of the acquisitions; our ability to compete with larger, better financed life sciences companies; our history of losses and expectation of incurring losses; our ability to generate future revenues; our ability to successfully integrate our recently acquired businesses; our ability to raise additional capital to fund potential acquisitions; our volatile stock price; and the effects of our anti-takeover provisions. Further information on potential risk factors that could affect our financial results are included in the filings made by us from time to time with the SEC including under the sections entitled Risk Factors in our Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AN D PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate DCPs (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). DCPs are those controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company carried out an evaluation as of June 30, 2023 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s DCPs pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b). Based on the Company s evaluation at the time the Original Report was filed, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer had concluded that the Company s DCPs were effective as of June 30, 2023. Subsequent to that evaluation and as a result of the material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting discussed herein, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of June 30, 2023, the Company's DCPs were not effective at the reasonable level as of June 30, 2023, due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 In connection with the restatement of the Company s financial statements, management identified deficiencies related to the design and operating effectiveness of controls related to revenue recognition specific to the evaluation of accounting for contract terms, and has further concluded that such deficiencies represented a material weakness as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 as well as each of the interim periods within the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Remediation Plan for Material Weakness 
 Following identification of the revenue recognition material weakness, and as part of our commitment to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting, we are implementing remedial actions under the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board to address these deficiencies. Our remediation activities will include the following: 
 Designing new internal controls to validate there is a complete listing of revenue contracts that have non-standard terms, which require incremental accounting analysis under ASC 606. 

Designing new internal controls evaluating the accounting for contract amendments, including amendments accounted for as contract modifications. 

Enhancing and expanding our existing revenue recognition control procedures and attributes when evaluating the accounting impact of non-standard contract terms and contract modifications. 

Increasing education for internal resources on accounting for contracts within the scope of ASC 606 and deploying enablers to facilitate documentation of accounting analyses and conclusions. 

We will continue to monitor the design and operating effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures and controls and make any further changes management determines appropriate. 
 36 

Changes in Internal Control 
 Except for the material weakness described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred in the three months ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 37 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The matters discussed in this Amendment include forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but are based on various assumptions by management regarding future circumstances, over many of which Repligen has little or no control. A number of important risks and uncertainties, including those identified under the caption Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2022 and in subsequent filings, including this Amendment, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Other than as indicated below, there are no material changes to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2022. 
 Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults, or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank SVB was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC as receiver. Since that date, SVB has announced they have been acquired by First Citizens Bank and have resumed mostly normal operations. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership. If any of our lenders or counterparties to any such instruments were to be placed into receivership, we may be unable to access such funds. We have a banking relationship with SVB and hold cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of less than 0.1 million as of June 30, 2023 in SVB depository accounts to cover short-term operational payments. While we have not experienced any losses in such accounts, the recent failure of SVB caused us to utilize our accounts at other financial institutions in order to mitigate potential operational risks stemming from the temporary inability to access funds in our SVB operating accounts. In addition, if any of our customers, suppliers or other parties with whom we conduct business are unable to access funds pursuant to such instruments or lending arrangements with such a financial institution, such parties ability to pay their obligations to us or to enter into new commercial arrangements requiring additional payments to us could be adversely affected. 
 Inflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously issued government securities with interest rates below current market interest rates. Although the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board have announced a program to provide up to 25 billion of loans to financial institutions secured by certain of such government securities held by financial institutions to mitigate the risk of potential losses on the sale of such instruments, widespread demands for customer withdrawals or other liquidity needs of financial institutions for immediately liquidity may exceed the capacity of such program. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board will provide access to uninsured funds in the future in the event of the closure of other banks or financial institutions, or that they would do so in a timely fashion. 
 Although we assess our banking and customer relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect the Company, the financial institutions with which the Company has credit agreements or arrangements directly, or the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors could involve financial institutions or financial services industry companies with which the Company has financial or business relationships, but could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally. The results of events or concerns that involve one or more of these factors could include a variety of material and adverse impacts on our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on 
 38 

access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating expenses, financial obligations or fulfill our other obligations, result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations or result in violations of federal or state wage and hour laws. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors described above or other related or similar factors not described above, could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity and our current and/or projected business operations and financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, any further deterioration in the macroeconomic economy or financial services industry, could lead to losses or defaults by our suppliers, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our current and/or projected business operations and results of operations and financial condition. 
 Risks Related to Accounting and Financial Reporting Matters 
 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, which may result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations. 
 Effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and to assist in the effective prevention of fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business. We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies. In addition, we are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met, including objectives that may involve our reliance on third-party advisors and professionals. 
 In connection with the restatement of the Company s financial statements, and as discussed above in Part I, Item 4, Controls and Procedures, of this report, we identified deficiencies related to the design and operating effectiveness of certain controls related to revenue recognition. We concluded that such deficiencies represented a material weakness. 
 Following identification of the revenue recognition material weakness, and as part of our commitment to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting, we are implementing remedial actions under the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board to address these deficiencies. Our remediation activities will include the following: 
 Designing new internal controls to validate there is a complete listing of revenue contracts that have non-standard terms, which require incremental accounting analysis under ASC 606. 

Designing new internal controls evaluating the accounting for contract amendments, including amendments accounted for as contract modifications. 

Enhancing and expanding our existing revenue recognition control procedures and attributes when evaluating the accounting impact of non-standard contract terms and contract modifications. 

Increasing education for internal resources on accounting for contracts within the scope of ASC 606 and deploying enablers to facilitate documentation of accounting analyses and conclusions. 

We will continue to monitor the design and operating effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures and controls and make any further changes management determines appropriate. While we are undertaking efforts to remediate this material weakness, the material weakness will not be considered remediated until our remediation plan has been fully implemented, the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and we have concluded, through testing, that the newly implemented and enhanced controls are operating effectively. At this time, we cannot predict the success of such efforts or the outcome of our assessment of the remediation efforts. We can give no assurance that our efforts will remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the possibility of human error and the risk of fraud. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare the consolidated financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and regulations of 
 39 

the SEC, could be adversely affected which, in turn, may adversely affect our reputation and business and the trading price of our common stock. 
 Any failure to implement new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements and could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and cause a decline in the price of our common stock. In addition, any such failures could result in litigation or regulatory actions by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, loss of investor confidence, delisting of our securities and harm to our reputation and financial condition, or diversion of financial and management resources from the operation of our business. 
 The restatement of our financial statements may affect stockholder and investor confidence in us or harm our reputation, and may subject us to additional risks and uncertainties, including increased costs and the increased possibility of legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries, sanctions or investigations. 
 As a result of the restatement, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with, or related to, such restatement. In addition, such restatement could subject us to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including the increased possibility of legal proceedings and inquiries, sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our reputation, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting, or our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, or cause stockholders, investors, members and customers to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports or cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As of the date of this Amendment, we have no knowledge of any such legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries, sanctions or investigation. However, we can provide no assurance that such legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries, sanctions or investigation will not arise in the future. Any such legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries, sanctions or investigation, whether successful or not, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
