 share of common stock of the Company. 
 The Company, through the Bank, provides financial services to customers who are predominately small and middle-market businesses, professionals, and individuals residing in the Northern California region. The Company s primary loan products are commercial real estate loans, land development loans, construction loans, and operating lines of credit, and its primary deposit products are checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and term certificate accounts. The Bank currently has branch offices in Roseville, Natomas, Rancho Cordova, Redding, Elk Grove, Chico, Yuba City, and San Francisco.

million. 
 The method for determining the estimate of lifetime credit losses includes, among other things, the following main components: (i) the use of probability of default and loss given default assumptions under a discounted cash flow model; (ii) a multi-scenario macroeconomic forecast; (iii) an initial and reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year for all loan segments; and (iv) a reversion period of one year using a linear transition method to historical loss rates. 
 Given the inherent limitations of a quantitative-only model, qualitative adjustments are included to factor in data points not captured from a quantitative analysis alone. 
 Qualitative criteria that can be considered includes, among other things, the following: 
 Concentrations the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; 
 Volume changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of the loans; 
 Economic changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments; 
 Policy changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses; 
 Quality changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of non-accrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans; and 
 External the effect of other external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the Company s loan portfolio. 
 Management reviews current information on a quarterly basis to assess the forecasted future economic impact for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of the ACL. The forecasted direction and magnitude of change with respect to future economic conditions is then assessed against the estimate in the model. Any changes resulting from the quarterly assessment are recorded in Provision for credit losses in the unaudited consolidated statements of income. The Audit Committee of the board of directors reviews the adequacy of the allowance at least quarterly. 
 Accrued interest receivable is excluded from amortized cost of all financial instrument types and included in Interest receivable and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Accrued interest receivable is not subject to an estimate for credit loss, as the Company has a policy to charge off accrued interest deemed uncollectible in a timely manner. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, which occurs within 90 days of a borrower becoming delinquent, interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period income. 
 If an individual loan s characteristics have deteriorated to below a range of the overall pool, the loan would be individually assessed. Individually assessed loans are measured for credit loss based on one of the following methods: (i) present value of future expected cash flows, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate; (ii) amount by which carrying value of the loan exceeds the loan s observable market price; or (iii) the fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs, if the loan is collateral dependent. The Company applies the practical expedient and defines collateral dependent loans as those where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and on which payment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral.

 For securities issued by states and political subdivisions, for purposes of evaluating whether to recognize credit loss expense, management considers: (i) issuer and/or guarantor credit ratings; (ii) historical probability of default and loss given default rates for given bond ratings and remaining maturity; (iii) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities; (iv) internal credit review of the financial information; and (v) whether or not such securities have credit enhancements such as guarantees, contain a defeasance clause, or are pre-refunded by the issuers.

 There were and available-for-sale securities in unrealized loss positions at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the investment portfolio included investment securities that had been in a continuous loss position for twelve months or more and investment securities that had been in a loss position for less than twelve months. 
 There was held-to-maturity security in a continuous unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which had been in a continuous loss position for more than twelve months. 
 Obligations issued or guaranteed by government agencies such as the GNMA and the SBA or GSEs under conservatorship such as the FNMA and the FHLMC, are guaranteed or sponsored by agencies of the U.S. government and have strong credit profiles. The Company therefore expects to receive all contractual interest payments on time and believes the risk of credit losses on these securities is remote.

per share par value. The Company held million of FHLB stock at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The carrying amounts of these investments are reasonable estimates of fair value because the securities are restricted to member banks and do not have a readily determinable market value. Based on management s analysis of the FHLB s financial condition and certain qualitative factors, management determined that the FHLB stock was not impaired at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

 Underwriting 
 Commercial loans : Commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business. Underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Once it is determined that the borrower s management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen, the Company s management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay its obligations as agreed. Commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee; however, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. 
 Real estate loans : Real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to those for commercial loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected than other loans by conditions in the real estate market or in the general economy. The properties securing the Company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type. This diversity helps reduce the Company s exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography, and risk grade criteria. 
 Construction loans : With respect to construction loans that the Company may originate from time to time, the Company generally requires the borrower to have had an existing relationship with the Company and have a proven record of success. Construction loans may be underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity

 Management regularly reviews the Company s loans for accuracy of risk grades whenever new information is received. Borrowers are generally required to submit financial information at regular intervals. Typically, commercial borrowers with lines of credit are required to submit financial information with reporting intervals generally ranging from monthly to annually depending on credit size, risk, and complexity. In addition, investor commercial real estate borrowers with loans exceeding a certain dollar threshold are usually required to submit rent rolls or property income statements annually. Management monitors construction loans monthly and reviews consumer loans based on delinquency. Management also reviews loans graded watch or worse, regardless of loan type, no less than quarterly.

The arrangement provided that these executive officers would receive shares of restricted common stock of the Company that vested over , with the number of shares granted based upon achieving certain performance objectives. These objectives included, but were not limited to, net income adjusted for the provision for credit losses, deposit growth, efficiency ratio, net interest margin, and asset quality. Compensation expense for RSAs granted under the Historical Incentive Plan is recognized over the service period, which is equal to the vesting period of the shares based on the fair value of the shares at issue date. 
 In connection with its IPO in May 2021, the Company granted RSAs under the Equity Incentive Plan to certain employees, officers, executives, and non-employee directors. Shares granted to non-employee directors vested immediately upon grant, while shares granted to certain employees, officers, and executives vest ratably over three , five , or (as defined in the respective agreements). Since the completion of the IPO, the Company has granted RSAs under the Equity Incentive Plan to certain executives, which vest ratably over three or five years (as defined in the respective agreements), and to directors, which vest over . All RSAs were granted at the fair value of common stock at the time of the award. The RSAs are considered fixed awards, as the number of shares and fair value are known at the date of grant and the fair value at the grant date is amortized over the service period. 
 Non-cash stock compensation expense recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. Non-cash stock compensation expense recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were and unvested restricted shares, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested restricted shares. The holders of unvested RSAs are entitled to dividends at the same per-share ratio as holders of common stock. Tax benefits for dividends paid on unvested RSAs are recorded as tax benefits in the consolidated statements of income with a corresponding decrease to current taxes payable. Such tax benefits are expected to be recognized over the weighted average term remaining on the unvested restricted shares of years as of September 30, 2024. The impact of tax benefits for dividends paid on unvested restricted stock on the Company s unaudited consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial.

 The Company records an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments at the consolidated balance sheet date based on estimates of the probability that these commitments will be drawn upon according to historical utilization experience of the different types of commitments and historical loss rates determined for pooled funded loans. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments totaled million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023, which is recorded in Interest payable and other liabilities in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. 
 Concentrations of credit risk : The Company grants real estate mortgage, real estate construction, commercial, and consumer loans to customers primarily in Northern California. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion is secured by commercial and residential real estate. 
 In management s judgment, a concentration of loans exists in real estate related loans, which represented approximately of the Company s loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 and of the Company s loan portfolio at December 31, 2023. Although management believes such concentrations have no more than the normal risk of collectability, a substantial decline in the economy in general, or a decline in real estate values in the Company s primary market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on the collectability of these loans. Personal and business incomes represent the primary source of repayment for the majority of these loans. 
 Deposit concentrations : At September 30, 2024, the Company had deposit relationships that exceeded million each, totaling billion, or approximately of total deposits. The Company s largest single deposit relationship at September 30, 2024 totaled million, or approximately of total deposits. Management maintains the Company s liquidity position and lines of credit with correspondent banks to mitigate the risk of large withdrawals by this group of large depositors. 
 Contingencies : The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions will not materially affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.

 Company Overview 
 Headquartered in the greater Sacramento metropolitan area of California, Five Star Bancorp is a bank holding company that operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, Five Star Bank, a California state-chartered non-member bank. We provide a broad range of banking products and services to small and medium-sized businesses, professionals, and individuals primarily in Northern California through eight branch offices. Our mission is to strive to become the top business bank in all markets we serve through exceptional service, deep connectivity, and customer empathy. We are dedicated to serving real estate, agricultural, faith-based, and small to medium-sized enterprises. We aim to consistently deliver value that meets or exceeds the expectations of our shareholders, customers, employees, business partners, and community. We refer to our mission as purpose-driven and integrity-centered banking. At September 30, 2024, we had total assets of 3.9 billion, total loans held for investment of 3.5 billion, and total deposits of 3.4 billion. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all footnotes as would be necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows in conformity with GAAP as contained within the FASB s ASC and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the instructions to Regulation S-X. However, these interim unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments and accruals) which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the interim periods presented. These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on 
 31 

a basis consistent with, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited consolidated financial statements as filed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes thereto. 
 Our most significant accounting policies and our critical accounting estimates are described in greater detail in Note 1, Basis of Presentation, in our audited consolidated financial statements and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have identified accounting policies and estimates that, due to the difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and assumptions inherent in those policies and estimates and the potential sensitivity of our unaudited consolidated financial statements to those judgments and assumptions, are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the judgments, estimates, and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable and appropriate, based on the information available at the time they were made. However, actual results may differ from those estimates, and these differences may be material. With the exception of the changes to the ACL described below, there have been no significant changes concerning our critical accounting estimates as described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), as an emerging growth company, we can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for adopting any new or revised accounting standards. We have elected not to opt out of the extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public and private companies, we may adopt the standard on the application date for private companies. 
 We have elected to take advantage of the scaled disclosures and other relief under the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us under the JOBS Act, so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses ACL 
 The ACL represents the estimated probable credit losses in our loan and investment portfolios and is estimated as of September 30, 2024 using CECL. The ACL is established through a provision for credit losses charged to operations. Loans and investments are charged against the ACL when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts, if any, are credited to the ACL. 
 The ACL is evaluated on a regular basis by management in consideration of optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic current conditions, and is based on management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions specifically impacting each loan type by purpose and by geography, and concentrations within the loan portfolio. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. 
 A significant amount of the ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis by loan and investment security type when similar risk characteristics exist. Pools are determined based primarily on regulatory reporting codes as the loans and investment securities within each pool share similar risk characteristics and there is sufficient historical peer loss data from the FFIEC to provide statistically meaningful support in the models developed. Reserves for credit losses identified on a pooled basis are then adjusted for qualitative and other environmental factors to reflect current conditions. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we refined our methodology of measuring the ACL on CRE Non-Owner Occupied loans. Within the CRE Non-Owner Occupied portfolio, RV Park loans were segregated from traditional CRE Non-Owner Occupied loans as we identified a data source to provide sufficient historical peer loss data specific to RV Park loans. This segregation now adjusts for differences in the risk characteristics and performance of RV Park loans compared to traditional CRE Non-Owner Occupied properties. We used calculations of individual probability of default and loss given default on a loan-by-loan basis to derive an estimated loss rate. Applying this adjusted loss rate led to a decrease in the ACL for the RV Park pool of approximately 3.3 million as of September 30, 2024.

Executive Summary 
 Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 10.9 million and 32.4 million, respectively, as compared to net income of 11.0 million and 36.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The following are highlights of our operating and financial performance, and financial condition for the dates and periods presented: 
 Deposits. Total deposits increased by 373.1 million from 3.0 billion at December 31, 2023 to 3.4 billion at September 30, 2024. Non-wholesale deposits increased by 323.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 to 3.0 billion. Wholesale deposits, which the Company defines as brokered deposits and public time deposits, increased by 49.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 to 409.9 million. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased by 75.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 to 906.9 million, and represented 26.67 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, as compared to 27.46 of total deposits at December 31, 2023. Our loan to deposit ratio was 101.87 at September 30, 2024, as compared to 102.19 at December 31, 2023. 
 Assets. Total assets were 3.9 billion at September 30, 2024, representing a 293.9 million, or 8.18 , increase compared to 3.6 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 Loans. Total loans held for investment were 3.5 billion at September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.1 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 378.8 million, or 12.29 . The increase was primarily attributable to increases of 232.6 million in consumer and other loans, 127.2 million in commercial real estate loans, and 30.0 million in commercial construction loans, partially offset by decreases in residential construction and commercial land and development loans of 12.0 million and 10.8 million, respectively. 
 Credit Quality. Credit quality remains strong, with non-accrual loans representing 1.8 million, or 0.05 of total loans held for investment, at September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.0 million, or 0.06 of total loans held for investment, at December 31, 2023. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans held for investment was 1.09 at September 30, 2024 and 1.12 December 31, 2023. 
 Net Interest Margin. Net interest margin was 3.37 and 3.30 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 3.31 and 3.50 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to higher yields on new and repriced loans, partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to larger average deposit balances at higher rates. The decrease in net interest margin between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily due to increases in deposit costs. 
 Efficiency Ratio. Efficiency ratio was 43.37 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up from 41.63 for the corresponding period of 2023, mainly due to increased expenses for employees hired since September 2023 to support expansion into the San Francisco Bay Area. 
 Capital Ratios . All capital ratios were above well-capitalized regulatory thresholds as of September 30, 2024. The total risk-based capital ratio for the Company was 13.94 at September 30, 2024, as compared to 12.30 at December 31, 2023. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.83 at September 30, 2024, as compared to 8.73 at December 31, 2023. For additional information about the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank, see the section entitled Financial Condition Summary Capital Adequacy below. 
 Dividends. The board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0.20 per share on July 18, 2024.

1 Tangible shareholders equity to tangible assets is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. See the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Tangible shareholders equity to tangible assets is defined as total equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is total shareholders equity to total assets. We had no goodwill or other intangible assets at the end of any period indicated. As a result, tangible shareholders equity to tangible assets is the same as total shareholders equity to total assets at the end of each of the periods indicated. 
 2 Tangible book value per share is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. See the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Tangible book value per share is defined as total shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by the outstanding number of common shares at the end of the period. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is book value per share. We had no goodwill or other intangible assets at the end of any period indicated. As a result, tangible book value per share is the same as book value per share at the end of each of the periods indicated. 
 3 Cash dividend payout ratio on common stock is calculated as dividends on common shares divided by basic earnings per common share.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion of our results of operations compares the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is the most significant contributor to our net income. Net interest income represents interest income from interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits, subordinated notes, and other borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. In evaluating our net interest income, we measure and monitor yields on our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as well as trends in our net interest margin. Net interest margin is a ratio calculated as net interest income divided by total interest-earning assets for the same period. We manage our earning assets and funding sources in order to maximize this margin while limiting credit risk and interest rate sensitivity to our established risk appetite levels. Changes in market interest rates and competition in our market typically have the largest impact on periodic changes in our net interest margin. 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net interest income increased 2.9 million to 30.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 and our net interest margin of 3.37 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased from 3.31 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income driven by higher yields on new and repriced loans, partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to larger average deposit balances at higher rates. Additional detail relating to net interest margin in each period is provided below.

 1 Interest income/expense is divided by the actual number of days in the period multiplied by the actual number of days in the year to correspond to stated interest rate terms, where applicable. 
 2 Yields on available-for-sale securities are calculated based on fair value. Investment security interest is earned on a 30/360 day basis monthly. Yields are not calculated on a tax-equivalent basis. 
 3 Non-accrual loans are included in total loan balances. No adjustment has been made for these loans in the yield calculations. Interest income on loans includes amortization of deferred loan fees, net of deferred loan costs. Allowance for credit losses is not included in total loan balances. 
 4 Allowance for credit losses is included in interest receivable and other assets, net. 
 5 Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets minus the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. 
 6 Net interest margin is computed by calculating the difference between interest income and interest expense, divided by the average balance of interest-earning assets, then annualized based on the number of days in the given period. 
 37 

Analysis of changes in interest income and expenses. Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average yields/rates. Table 4 shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned from our interest-earning assets and interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the current period s average yield/rate. The effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/rate by the previous period s volume. Changes not solely attributable to volume or yields/rates have been allocated in proportion to the respective volume and yield/rate components.

 Net interest income increased 2.9 million and net interest margin increased six basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in net interest income is primarily attributable to higher yields on new and repriced loans, partially offset by larger average deposit balances at higher interest rates. Interest income increased by 7.6 million compared to the same quarter of the prior year. The average yield on loans increased 41 basis points compared to the same quarter of the prior year due to increases in interest rates and an increase in average balances of 371.9 million, or 12.47 . The increase in interest income was partially offset by an additional 4.7 million in interest expense compared to the same quarter of the prior year. The average cost of total deposits increased 45 basis points compared to the same quarter of the prior year, due to increases in interest rates and an increase in average balances of 200.6 million, or 6.72 . 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net interest income increased 2.0 million, or 2.40 , to 86.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while our net interest margin of 3.30 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 20 basis points when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest income driven by higher yields on new and repriced loans, partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to larger average deposit balances at higher rates. Additional detail relating to net interest margin in each period is provided below.

 1 Interest income/expense is divided by the actual number of days in the period multiplied by the actual number of days in the year to correspond to stated interest rate terms, where applicable. 
 2 Yields on available-for-sale securities are calculated based on fair value. Investment security interest is earned on a 30/360 day basis monthly. Yields are not calculated on a tax-equivalent basis. 
 3 Non-accrual loans are included in total loan balances. No adjustment has been made for these loans in the yield calculations. Interest income on loans includes amortization of deferred loan fees, net of deferred loan costs. Allowance for credit losses is not included in total loan balances. 
 4 Allowance for credit losses is included in interest receivable and other assets, net. 
 5 Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets minus the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. 
 6 Net interest margin is computed by calculating the difference between interest income and interest expense, divided by the average balance of interest-earning assets, then annualized based on the number of days in the given period.

Analysis of changes in interest income and expenses. Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average yields/rates. Table 6 shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned from our interest-earning assets and interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the current period s average yield/rate. The effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/rate by the previous period s volume. Changes not solely attributable to volume or yields/rates have been allocated in proportion to the respective volume and yield/rate components.

 Net interest income increased 2.0 million, while net interest margin decreased 20 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest income driven by higher yields on new and repriced loans, partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to larger average deposit balances at higher rates. Interest income increased by 21.0 million compared to the same period of the prior year. The average yield on loans increased 36 basis points compared to the same period of the prior year due to an increase in average balances of 300.5 million, or 10.32 , and increased interest rates on new and repriced loans. The increase in interest income was partially offset by an additional 19.0 million in interest expense compared to the same period of the prior year. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 90 basis points compared to the same period of the prior year due to increases in interest rates and an increase in average balances of 220.5 million, or 10.73 . In addition, the average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits decreased by 14.0 million, or 1.64 , compared to the same period of the prior year. While the increase in total interest income more than offset the increase in total interest expense, net interest income relative to interest-earning assets decreased compared to the same period of the prior year. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses is based on management s assessment of the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses. Factors impacting the provision include inherent risk characteristics in our loan portfolio, the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs, both current and historic, local economic and credit conditions, the direction of the change in collateral values, and the funding probability on unfunded lending commitments. The provision for credit losses is charged against earnings in order to maintain our allowance for credit losses, which reflects management s best estimate of forecasted life of loan losses in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 We recorded a 2.8 million provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to a 1.1 million provision for credit losses for the same period of 2023. The provision recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects loan growth and continued risks associated with general economic forecasts. 
 40 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 We recorded a 5.7 million provision for credit losses in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to a 3.2 million provision for credit losses for the same period of 2023. The provision recorded during the first nine months of 2024 reflects loan growth and continued risks associated with general economic forecasts. 
 
 Non-interest Income 
 Non-interest income is a secondary contributor to our net income, following interest income. Non-interest income consists of service charges on deposit accounts, net gain on sale of securities, gain on sale of loans, loan-related fees, FHLB stock dividends, earnings on BOLI, and other income.

 Gain on sale of loans. The decrease related primarily to an overall decline in the volume of loans sold, partially offset by an improvement in the effective yield of loans sold. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 4.4 million of loans were sold with an effective yield of 7.03 , as compared to approximately 7.0 million of loans sold with an effective yield of 5.63 during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Service charges on deposit accounts . The increase resulted primarily from a 0.1 million increase in wire transfer fees recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 41 

Gain on sale of loans. The decrease related primarily to an overall decline in the volume of loans sold, partially offset by an improvement in the effective yield of loans sold period over period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 16.4 million of loans were sold with an effective yield of 6.87 , as compared to approximately 30.6 million of loans sold with an effective yield of 5.34 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Loan-related fees . The increase primarily related to an increase of 0.1 million in swap referral fees recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 FHLB stock dividends. The increase was primarily due to increased yields on dividends received, combined with an increase in the average number of FHLB shares outstanding between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. 
 Earnings on BOLI. The increase was primarily due to additional policies purchased between September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. 
 Other income. The decrease resulted primarily from the difference between a 1.3 million gain from distributions received on equity investments in venture-backed funds during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to a 0.2 million gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Non-interest Expense 
 Non-interest expense includes salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing and software, FDIC insurance, professional services, advertising and promotional, loan-related expenses, and other operating expenses. In evaluating our level of non-interest expense, we closely monitor the Company s efficiency ratio, which is calculated as non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income. We constantly seek to identify ways to streamline our business and operate more efficiently in order to reduce our non-interest expense over time as a percentage of our revenue, while continuing to achieve growth in total loans and assets. 
 Over the past several years, we have invested significant resources in personnel, technology, and infrastructure. As we execute initiatives based on growth, we expect non-interest expense to grow. Non-interest expense has increased throughout the periods presented below; however, we expect our efficiency ratio will improve going forward due, in part, to our past investment in infrastructure.

 Salaries and employee benefits. The increase related primarily to: (i) a 1.0 million increase in salaries, benefits, and bonus expense, mainly for employees hired since September 2023 to support expansion into the San Francisco Bay Area; and (ii) a 0.2 million increase in commissions paid, primarily to new employees in the San Francisco Bay Area. This was partially offset by a 0.1 million increase in loan origination costs due to a higher number of loan originations, net of purchased consumer loans, period-over-period. 
 42 

Data processing and software. The increase was primarily due to: (i) increased usage of our digital banking platform; (ii) higher transaction volumes related to the increased number of loan and deposit accounts; and (iii) an increased number of licenses required for new users on our loan origination and documentation system. 
 Professional services. The increase was primarily due to a 0.1 million increase in fees for 2024 audits and examinations. 
 Other operating expenses. The increase was primarily due to 0.1 million in operational losses on deposit accounts.

 Salaries and employee benefits. The increase was primarily a result of: (i) a 2.5 million increase in salaries, benefits, and bonus expense for new employees hired since September 2023 to support expansion into the San Francisco Bay Area; (ii) a 0.7 million increase in commission expense, primarily due to commissions paid to new employees in the San Francisco Bay Area; and (iii) a 0.2 million decrease in loan origination costs due to fewer loan originations, net of purchased consumer loans, period-over-period. 
 Occupancy and equipment. The increase related to rent expense for the San Francisco branch office during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which did not exist for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Data processing and software. The increase was primarily due to: (i) increased usage of our digital banking platform; (ii) higher transaction volumes related to the increased number of loan and deposit accounts; and (iii) an increased number of licenses required for new users on our loan origination and documentation system. 
 Professional services. The increase was primarily due to: (i) a 0.3 million increase of audit fees for 2024 audits; and (ii) a 0.2 million increase in IT consulting services due to an overall increase in service charges and product enhancements to existing platforms. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The provision for income taxes was 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 0.5 million decrease from the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decline was primarily driven by an overall decrease in pre-tax income combined with a 0.2 million adjustment to the provision during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to true-up the year-to-date effective tax rate, which did not occur during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 28.21 and 30.07 , respectively. 
 43 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 The provision for income taxes was 13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an overall decrease in pre-tax income period-over-period, partially offset by a 0.5 million state tax benefit recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 relating to an overall reduction in the state tax blended rate for the Company since its transition to a C Corporation. No such benefit was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 28.66 and 28.23 , respectively. 
 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION SUMMARY 
 The following discussion compares our financial condition as of September 30, 2024 to our financial condition as of December 31, 2023. Table 11 summarizes selected components of our unaudited consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Table 11: Selected Components of Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) 
 (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024

 Total assets 3,887,004 3,593,125 Cash and cash equivalents 250,852 321,576 Total investments 106,958 111,160 Loans held for investment 3,460,565 3,081,719 Total deposits 3,399,979 3,026,896 Subordinated notes, net 73,859 73,749 Total shareholders equity 389,930 285,774 
 
 Total Assets 
 At September 30, 2024, total assets were 3.9 billion, an increase of 293.9 million from 3.6 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to a 378.8 million increase in total loans held for investment, partially offset by a 70.7 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents. The 378.8 million increase in total loans held for investment included 254.7 million in purchases of loans within the consumer concentration of the loan portfolio. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Total cash and cash equivalents were 250.9 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 70.7 million from 321.6 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings of 170.0 million and 389.1 million in loan originations, net of repayments, partially offset by an increase in deposits of 373.1 million, 80.9 million in net proceeds from the 2024 Public Offering (as defined below), and pre-tax income of 45.4 million. 
 
 Investment Portfolio 
 Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and obligations of states and political subdivisions, which are high-quality liquid investments. We manage our investment portfolio according to written investment policies approved by our board of directors. Our investment strategy is designed to maximize earnings while maintaining liquidity with minimal credit and interest rate risk. Most of our securities are classified as available-for-sale, although we have one long-term, fixed rate municipal security classified as held-to-maturity. 
 Our total securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity amounted to 107.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 111.2 million at December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of 4.2 million period-over-period. The decrease to available-for-sale securities was primarily due to maturities, prepayments, and calls of 6.4 million and an unrealized gain on securities of 2.9 million, with the remainder of the change due to amortization of premiums. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other comprehensive gain was 2.0 million, primarily due to rate changes and other market conditions on securities.

 Weighted average yield for securities available-for-sale is the projected yield to maturity given current cash flow projections for U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized mortgage obligations. For callable municipal securities and corporate bonds, weighted average yield is a yield to worst. Weighted average yield for securities held-to-maturity is the stated coupon of the bond.

Loan Portfolio 
 Our loan portfolio is our largest class of interest-earning assets and typically provides higher yields than other types of interest-earning assets. Associated with the higher yields is an inherent amount of credit risk, which we attempt to mitigate with strong underwriting standards. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our total loans amounted to 3.5 billion and 3.1 billion, respectively. Table 14 presents the balance and associated percentage of each major product type within our portfolio as of the dates indicated.

 Commercial real estate loans consist of term loans secured by a mortgage lien on the real property, such as office and industrial buildings, manufactured home communities, self-storage facilities, hospitality properties, faith-based properties, retail shopping centers, and apartment buildings, as well as commercial real estate construction loans that are offered to builders and developers. 
 Commercial land and development and commercial construction loans consist of loans made to fund commercial land acquisition and development and commercial construction, respectively. The real estate purchased with these loans is generally located in or near our market. 
 Commercial loans consist of financing for commercial purposes in various lines of business, including manufacturing, service industry, and professional service areas. Commercial loans can be secured or unsecured but are generally secured with the assets of the company and/or the personal guaranty of the business owner(s). 
 Residential real estate and construction real estate loans consist of loans secured by single-family and multifamily residential properties, which are both owner-occupied and investor-owned.

Table 15 presents the commercial real estate loan balance, associated percentage of commercial real estate concentrations, estimated real estate collateral values, and related loan-to-value LTV ranges by collateral type as of the dates indicated. Revolving lines of credit with zero balance and 0.00 LTV are excluded from this table. Collateral values are determined at origination using third-party real estate appraisals or evaluations. Updated appraisals, which are included in Table 15, may be obtained for loans that are downgraded to watch or substandard. Loans over 2.0 million are reviewed annually, at which time an internal assessment of collateral values is completed.

 Over the past several years, we have experienced significant growth in our loan portfolio, although the relative composition of the portfolio has not changed materially. Our primary focus remains commercial real estate lending (including commercial, commercial land and development, and commercial construction), which constitutes 84.01 of loans held for investment at September 30, 2024. Commercial secured lending represents 4.99 of loans held for investment at September 30, 2024. We sell the guaranteed portion of all SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market and will continue to do so as long as market conditions continue to be favorable. 
 48 

We recognize that our commercial real estate loan concentration is significant within our balance sheet. Commercial real estate loan balances as a percentage of risk-based capital were 569.86 and 682.72 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We have established internal concentration limits in the loan portfolio for commercial real estate loans by sector (e.g., manufactured home communities, self-storage, hospitality, etc.). All loan sectors were within our established limits as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, our loans are geographically concentrated with borrowers and collateralized properties primarily in California. 
 We believe that our past success is attributable to focusing on products and markets where we have significant expertise. Given our concentrations, we have established strong risk management practices, including risk-based lending standards, self-established product and geographical limits, annual evaluations of income property loans, and semi-annual top-down and bottom-up stress testing. We expect to continue growing our loan portfolio. We do not expect our product or geographic concentrations to materially change.

 Asset Quality 
 We manage the quality of our loans based upon trends at the overall loan portfolio level, as well as within each product type. We measure and monitor key factors that include the level and trend of classified, delinquent, non-accrual, and nonperforming assets, collateral coverage, credit scores, and debt service coverage, where applicable. These metrics directly impact our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses. 
 Our primary objective is to maintain a high level of asset quality in our loan portfolio. We believe our underwriting policies and practices, executed by experienced professionals, appropriately govern the risk profile for our loan portfolio. These policies are continually evaluated and updated as necessary. All loans are assessed and assigned a risk classification at origination based on underlying characteristics of the transaction, such as collateral cash flow, collateral coverage, and borrower strength. We believe that we have a comprehensive methodology to proactively monitor our credit quality after the origination process. Particular emphasis is placed on our commercial portfolio, where risk assessments are reevaluated as a result of reviewing commercial property operating statements and borrower financials. On an ongoing basis, we also monitor payment performance, delinquencies, and tax and property insurance compliance. We design our practices to facilitate the early detection and remediation of problems within our loan portfolio. Assigned risk classifications are an integral part of management s assessment of the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses. We periodically employ the 
 50 

use of an independent consulting firm to evaluate our underwriting and risk assessment process. Like other financial institutions, we are subject to the risk that our loan portfolio will be exposed to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions and rising interest rates. 
 Nonperforming Assets 
 Our nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate, if any. Nonperforming loans consist of non-accrual loans and loans contractually past due by 90 days or more and still accruing. Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as non-accrual loans. Accrual of interest on loans is discontinued either when reasonable doubt exists as to the full and timely collection of interest or principal or when a loan becomes contractually past due by 90 days or more with respect to interest or principal. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all interest previously accrued, but not collected, is reversed against current period interest income. Income on such loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received and where the future collection of principal is probable. Interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal and when, in the judgment of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest. 
 SBA Loans 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 10 and 50 SBA 7(a) loans, respectively, with government-guaranteed portions totaling 4.4 million and 16.4 million, respectively. The Company received gross proceeds of 4.7 million and 17.5 million on the loans sold during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, resulting in the recognition of net gains on sale of 0.3 million and 1.1 million during the respective periods.

Potential Problem Loans 
 We utilize a risk grading system for our loans to aid us in evaluating the overall credit quality of our real estate loan portfolio and assessing the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses. All loans are grouped into a risk category at the time of origination. Commercial real estate loans over 2.0 million are reevaluated at least annually for proper classification in conjunction with our review of property and borrower financial information. All loans are reevaluated for proper risk grading as new information such as payment patterns, collateral condition, and other relevant information comes to our attention. 
 The banking industry defines loans graded substandard or doubtful as classified loans. Table 19 shows our levels of classified loans as of the periods indicated.

 Loans designated as watch and substandard, which are not considered adversely classified, increased to 92.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 41.6 million at December 31, 2023. There were no loans with doubtful risk grades at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses charged to operations. Provisions are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses. 
 52 

The allowance for credit losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based on management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company s allowance for credit losses was 37.6 million, as compared to 34.4 million at December 31, 2023. The 3.2 million increase in the allowance is due to a 6.0 million provision for credit losses recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by net charge-offs of 2.8 million, mainly attributable to commercial and industrial loans, during the same period. 
 While the entire allowance for credit losses is available to absorb losses from any and all loans, Table 20 represents management s allocation of our allowance for credit losses by loan category, and the balance of loans in each category as a percentage of total loans, for the periods indicated.

Liabilities 
 During the first nine months of 2024, total liabilities increased by 189.7 million from 3.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 to 3.5 billion as of September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to an increase in total deposits of 373.1 million, comprised of an increase of 297.2 million in interest-bearing deposits and an increase of 75.8 million in non-interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease in borrowings of 170.0 million. The 297.2 million increase in interest-bearing deposits included an increase in non-wholesale deposits of 323.3 million, an increase in brokered deposits of 174.8 million, and a decrease in public time deposits of 125.0 million. 
 
 Deposits 
 Representing 97.22 of our total liabilities as of September 30, 2024, deposits are our primary source of funding for our business operations. 
 Total deposits increased by 373.1 million, or 12.33 , to 3.4 billion at September 30, 2024 from 3.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in existing deposit relationships. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased by 75.8 million from December 31, 2023 to 906.9 million at September 30, 2024, representing 26.67 of total deposits at that date, as compared to 27.46 of total deposits at December 31, 2023. Our loan to deposit ratio was 101.87 at September 30, 2024, as compared to 102.19 at December 31, 2023. We intend to continue to operate our business with close monitoring of the loan to deposit ratio.

 FHLB Advances and Other Borrowings 
 From time to time, we utilize short-term collateralized FHLB borrowings to maintain adequate liquidity. There were no borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and borrowings of 170.0 million outstanding from the FHLB as of December 31, 2023. 
 In 2022, we issued subordinated notes of 75.0 million. This debt was issued to investors in private placement transactions. See Note 6, Long Term Debt and Other Borrowings, in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding these subordinated notes. The proceeds of the notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for the Company under the regulatory capital rules of the federal banking agencies.

Shareholders Equity 
 Shareholders equity totaled 389.9 million at September 30, 2024 and 285.8 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders equity was primarily a result of 80.9 million of additional common stock issued and outstanding in 2024, net income recognized of 32.4 million, and a 2.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by 12.0 million in cash dividends paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity Management 
 We manage liquidity based upon factors that include the level of diversification of our funding sources, the composition of our deposit types, the availability of unused funding sources, our off-balance sheet obligations, the amount of cash and liquid securities we hold, and the availability of assets to be readily converted into cash without undue loss. As the primary federal regulator of the Bank, the FDIC evaluates our liquidity on a stand-alone basis pursuant to applicable guidance and policies. 
 Liquidity refers to our capacity to meet our cash obligations at a reasonable cost. Our cash obligations require us to have cash flow that is adequate to fund loan growth and maintain on-balance sheet liquidity while meeting present and future obligations of deposit withdrawals, borrowing maturities, and other contractual cash obligations. In managing our cash flows, management regularly confronts situations that can give rise to increased liquidity risk. These include funding mismatches, market constraints in accessing sources of funds, and the ability to convert assets into cash. Changes in economic conditions or exposure to borrower credit quality, capital markets, and operational, legal, or reputational risks could also affect the Bank s liquidity risk profile and are considered in the assessment of liquidity management. 
 The Company is a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, must provide for its own liquidity, including liquidity required to meet its debt service requirements on its subordinated notes. The Company s main source of cash flow is dividends declared and paid to it by the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company, including various legal and regulatory provisions that limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to the Company without regulatory approval. Under the California Financial Code, payment of a dividend from the Bank to the Company without advance regulatory approval is restricted to the lesser of the Bank s retained earnings or the amount of the Bank s net income from the previous three fiscal years less the amount of dividends paid during that period. We believe that these limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations. For contingency purposes, the Company maintains a minimum level of cash to fund one year s projected operating cash flow needs plus two years subordinated notes debt service. We continually monitor our liquidity position in order to meet all reasonably foreseeable short-term, long-term, and strategic liquidity demands. Management has established a comprehensive process for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling liquidity risk. Because of its critical importance to the viability of the Bank, liquidity risk management is fully integrated into our risk management processes. Critical elements of our liquidity risk management include effective corporate governance, consisting of oversight by the board of directors and active involvement by management; appropriate strategies, policies, procedures, and limits used to manage and mitigate liquidity risk; comprehensive liquidity risk measurement and monitoring systems, including stress tests, that are commensurate with the complexity of our business activities; active management of intraday liquidity and collateral; an appropriately diverse mix of existing and potential future funding sources; adequate levels of highly liquid marketable securities free of legal, regulatory, or operational impediments that can be used to meet liquidity needs in stress situations; comprehensive contingency funding plans that sufficiently address potential adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow requirements; and internal controls and internal audit processes sufficient to determine the adequacy of the Bank s liquidity risk management process. 
 Our liquidity position is supported by management of our liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Our liquidity requirements are met primarily through our deposits, Federal Reserve Discount Window advances, FHLB advances, and the principal and interest payments we receive on loans and investment securities. Cash on hand, cash at third-party banks, investments available-for-sale, and maturing or prepaying balances in our investment and loan portfolios are our most liquid assets. Other sources of liquidity that are routinely available to us include funds from retail and wholesale deposits, advances from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Discount Window, and proceeds from the sale of loans. Less commonly used sources of funding include borrowings from established federal funds lines from unaffiliated commercial banks, and the issuance of debt or equity securities. We believe we have ample liquidity resources to fund future growth and meet other cash needs as necessary. 
 57 

In addition, we have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC registering 250.0 million for any combination of equity or debt securities, depository shares, warrants, purchase contracts, purchase units, subscription rights, and units in one or more offerings. Specific information on the terms of any securities being offered, including the expected use of proceeds from the sale of such securities, are provided at the time of the offering. In April 2024, we sold an aggregate of 3,967,500 shares of our common stock at a price of 21.75 per share in a public offering (the 2024 Public Offering ), for net proceeds to us, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us, of approximately 80.9 million, to be used for general corporate purposes and to support continued growth, including through investments in the Bank to pursue growth opportunities, and for working capital. The 2024 Public Offering used approximately 86.3 million of our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, leaving approximately 163.7 million available for future offerings. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Our executive officers and board of directors review our sources and potential uses of cash in connection with our annual budgeting process. Generally speaking, our principal funding source is cash from deposits, and our principal uses of cash include funding of loans, operating expenses, income taxes, and dividend payments, as described below. As of September 30, 2024, management believes the above-mentioned sources will provide adequate liquidity during the next twelve months for the Bank to meet its operating needs. In addition, in April 2024, the Company closed the 2024 Public Offering. The proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately 80.9 million, providing additional cash to support the Company s ongoing operating needs. 
 Loans 
 Loans are a significant use of cash in daily operations, and a source of cash as customers make payments on their loans or as loans are sold to other financial institutions. Cash flows from loans are affected by the timing and amount of customer payments and prepayments, changes in interest rates, the general economic environment, competition, and the political environment. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had cash outflows of 369.7 million in loan originations and advances, net of principal collected, and 19.4 million in loans originated for sale. 
 Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we enter into commitments to extend credit, such as commitments to fund new loans and undisbursed construction funds. While these commitments represent contractual cash requirements, a portion of these commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. At September 30, 2024, off-balance sheet commitments totaled 428.6 million. We expect to fund these commitments to the extent utilized primarily through the repayment of existing loans, deposit growth, and liquid assets. 
 Deposits 
 Deposits are our primary source of funding for our business operations, and the cost of deposits has a significant impact on our net interest income and net interest margin. 
 Our deposits are primarily made up of money market, interest-bearing transaction, time, and non-interest-bearing demand deposits. Aside from commercial and business clients, a significant portion of our deposits are from municipalities and non-profit organizations. Cash flows from deposits are impacted by the timing and amount of customer deposits, changes in market rates, and collateral availability. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had cash inflows of 373.1 million related to an increase in deposits. 
 During the twelve months following September 30, 2024, approximately 486.3 million of time deposits are expected to mature, which includes 274.9 million of brokered deposits. These deposits may or may not renew due to general competition. We expect the outflow will not be significant and can be replenished through our organic growth in deposits. We believe our emphasis on local deposits and our San Francisco Bay Area expansion provide a stable funding base. 
 At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents represented 7.38 of total deposits. 
 58 

Investment Securities 
 Our investment securities totaled 107.0 million at September 30, 2024. Mortgage-backed securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions comprised 51.17 and 35.98 of our investment portfolio, respectively. Cash proceeds from mortgage-backed securities result from payments of principal and interest by borrowers. Cash proceeds from obligations of states and political subdivisions occur when these securities are called or mature. Assuming the current prepayment speed and interest rate environment, we expect to receive approximately 8.9 million from our securities over the twelve months following September 30, 2024. In future periods, we expect to maintain approximately the same level of cash flows from our securities. Depending on market yield and our liquidity, we may purchase securities as a use of cash in our interest-earning asset portfolio. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had cash proceeds from sales, maturities, calls, and prepayments of securities of 6.4 million. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, securities available-for-sale totaled 104.2 million, of which 100.8 million has been pledged as collateral for borrowings and other commitments. 
 FHLB Financing 
 The Bank is a shareholder of the FHLB, which enables the Bank to have access to lower-cost FHLB financing when necessary. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had no outstanding borrowings and a total financing availability of 555.9 million, net of letters of credit issued of 567.5 million. 
 Federal Reserve Discount Window 
 The Company has the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Discount Window when necessary. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had no outstanding borrowings and a total financing availability of 858.3 million. 
 Correspondent Bank Lines of Credit 
 At September 30, 2024, the unused and available amount for borrowing from correspondent bank lines of credit was 175.0 million. 
 Total Liquidity 
 Total liquidity (consisting of cash and cash equivalents and unused and immediately available borrowing capacity as set forth in Table 26) was approximately 1.8 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 Table 26: Total Liquidity 
 September 30, 2024 Available (dollars in thousands) Line of Credit Letters of Credit Issued Borrowings FHLB advances 
 1,123,388 567,500 555,888 Federal Reserve Discount Window 858,251 858,251 Correspondent bank lines of credit 175,000 175,000 Cash and cash equivalents 250,852 Total 2,156,639 567,500 1,839,991 
 Future Contractual Obligations 
 Our estimated future contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 include both current and long-term obligations. Under our operating leases, we have an operating lease liability of 7.1 million. We have a current obligation of 486.3 million and a long-term obligation of 4.7 million related to time deposits, as discussed in Note 5, Interest-Bearing Deposits. We have net subordinated notes of 73.9 million, all of which are long-term obligations. We also have contractual obligations on unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaling 428.6 million. 
 59 

Dividends 
 The Company paid dividends to its shareholders totaling 4.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends with respect to our common stock, subject to our board of directors discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. We believe our quarterly dividend rate per share, as approved by our board of directors, enables us to balance our multiple objectives of managing our business and returning a portion of our earnings to our shareholders. Assuming continued payment during the rest of 2024 at a rate of 0.20 per share, our average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately 4.3 million based on the number of currently outstanding shares if there are no increases or decreases in the number of shares, and given that unvested RSAs share equally in dividends with outstanding common stock. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 Our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations. Unlike industrial companies, nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods or services. 
 Historical Information 
 Table 27 summarizes our consolidated cash flow activities. 
 Table 27: Consolidated Cash Flow Activities 
 Nine months ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by operating activities 33,792 40,547 (6,755) Net cash used in investing activities (376,490) (207,705) (168,785) Net cash provided by financing activities 271,974 230,715 41,259 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by operating activities is subject to variability period-over-period as a result of timing differences, including with respect to the collection of receivables and payments of interest expense, accounts payable, and bonuses. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 168.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a higher number of loan originations, including purchased consumer loans. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased by 41.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to deposit growth and proceeds from the 2024 Public Offering, partially offset by lower borrowings. 
 
 Capital Adequacy 
 We manage our capital by tracking our level and quality of capital with consideration given to our overall financial condition, our asset quality, our level of allowance for credit losses, our geographic and industry concentrations, and other risk factors on our balance sheet, including interest rate sensitivity. 
 60 

Bancorp and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements as set forth in Tables 28 and 29 can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Historically, as a bank holding company which had less than 3.0 billion in total consolidated assets and that met certain other criteria, we had been operating under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, which provides an exemption from the Federal Reserve s generally applicable risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio requirements. Having passed this threshold as of September 30, 2022, we are no longer subject to this policy statement and our capital adequacy is evaluated relative to the Federal Reserve s generally applicable capital requirements. Additionally, as of June 30, 2023, the Company s consolidated assets were in excess of 3.0 billion, and as a consequence, beginning in March 2024, the Company no longer prepares and files financial reports with the Federal Reserve as a small bank holding company and is subject to capital ratio requirements for bank holding companies. 
 Under federal regulations implementing the Basel III framework, the Bank is subject to minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements. The Bank also is subject to regulatory thresholds that must be met for an insured depository institution to be classified as well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items, as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts for Bancorp and the Bank, and the Bank s prompt corrective action classification, are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings, and other factors. As of September 30, 2024, both Bancorp and the Bank were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank qualified as well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework. 
 Management reviews capital ratios on a regular basis to ensure that capital exceeds the prescribed regulatory minimums and is adequate to meet our anticipated future needs. For all periods presented, the Bank s ratios exceed the regulatory definition of well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, and Bancorp s ratios exceed the minimum ratios required for it to be considered a well-capitalized bank holding company. 
 The capital adequacy ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for Bancorp and the Bank are presented in Tables 28 and 29. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Bancorp s Tier 2 capital included subordinated notes, which were not included at the Bank level. Eligible amounts of subordinated notes included in Tier 2 capital will be phased out by 20 per year beginning five years before the maturity date of the notes.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Some of the financial measures discussed herein are non-GAAP financial measures. In accordance with SEC rules, we classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our consolidated statements of income, balance sheets, statements of shareholders equity, or statements of cash flows. 
 Tangible shareholders equity to tangible assets is defined as total equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is total shareholders equity to total assets. We had no goodwill or other intangible assets at the end of any period indicated. As a result, tangible shareholders equity to tangible assets is the same as total shareholders equity to total assets at the end of each of the periods indicated. 
 Tangible book value per share is defined as total shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by the outstanding number of common shares at the end of the period. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is book value per share. We had no goodwill or other intangible assets at the end of any period indicated. As a result, tangible book value per share is the same as book value per share at the end of each of the periods indicated. 
 We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP. However, we acknowledge that our non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, you should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and they are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other banking companies use. Other banking companies may use names similar to those we use for the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose, but may calculate them differently. You should understand how we and other companies each calculate our non-GAAP financial measures when making comparisons. 
 
 Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
 On September 17, 2024, the FDIC finalized changes to its Statement of Policy on Bank Merger Transactions (the Policy Statement ), which outlines factors that the FDIC will consider when evaluating a proposed bank merger transaction. Also on September 17, 2024, the United States Department of Justice (the DOJ withdrew its 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines and announced that it will instead evaluate the competitive impact of bank mergers using its 2023 Merger Guidelines that the DOJ applies to mergers in all industries. Compared to the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines, the 2023 Merger Guidelines 
 62 

set forth more stringent concentration limits and add several largely qualitative bases on which the DOJ may challenge a merger. While the effect of these changes for particular transactions remains unclear, both the Policy Statement and the change in the DOJ s bank merger antitrust policy may make it more difficult and/or costly for us to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or otherwise result in more onerous conditions to obtain approval for an acquisition. 
 On July 30, 2024, the FDIC issued a proposed rule that would revise the FDIC s regulations governing the classification and treatment of brokered deposits. The proposal would, among other changes, broaden the definition of deposit broker to include agents that place or facilitate the placement of third-party deposits at only one insured depository institution and agents that receive a fee or other remuneration in exchange for the placement of deposits. In addition, the proposal would narrow the exception to the definition of deposit broker for agents whose primary purpose is not the placement of funds with depository institutions. While we are evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule, if the rule is finalized as proposed, the Bank may be required to classify a greater amount of its deposits obtained through the involvement of third parties as brokered deposits. An increase in the amount of brokered deposits on the Bank s balance sheet could, among other consequences, increase the Bank s deposit insurance assessment costs.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. As a financial institution, the Company experiences market risk arising primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending and deposit-taking activities. Because the interest rates on the Company s assets and liabilities do not necessarily change at the same speed or rate as market interest rates, sudden and/or substantial changes in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings. In particular, the Company s financial results are sensitive to significant changes in the treasury yield curve, the Federal Funds rate, and the Wall Street Prime Index. 
 The Company s total interest income was 52.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 174.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our total interest expense was 22.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 63.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Overall, our net interest income was 30.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 110.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Economic value of equity EVE measures our long-term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest. EVE is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities at a point in time for a given set of market rate assumptions. An increase in EVE due to a specified rate change indicates an improvement in the long-term earnings capacity of the balance sheet, assuming that the rate change remains in effect over the life of the current balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, the Company carried a slightly higher balance of liabilities than assets that will reprice within the next twelve months in the event that interest rates fall. 
 Our policies and procedures provide management with guidelines for effective funds management, and we have established a measurement system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. This is overseen and adjusted as needed by our Management Asset Liability Committee on a monthly basis and our Director Asset Liability Committee on a quarterly basis. We have historically managed our sensitivity position within our established guidelines. With the intent of stabilizing or increasing net interest income, management typically deploys the Company s excess liquidity and seeks to migrate certain earning assets into higher-yielding categories (from investment securities into loans, for example). However, in situations where deposit balances contract, management relies upon various borrowing facilities and/or the use of brokered deposits. The Company monitors the impact of interest rate risk on EVE by reviewing and managing assets and liabilities with varying interest rate risks, such as cash and time deposits. Assets and liabilities are subject to fluctuations at each measurement date based on the composition of the balance sheet at each measurement date. EVE results are compared to previous periods and established policies on a quarterly basis. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the overnight Federal Funds rate (the rate used in the interest rate shock scenarios listed below) was 4.83 , a decrease from 5.33 at December 31, 2023. The scenarios presented assume that interest rates change instantaneously shock and that there are no significant changes in the structure of the Company s balance sheet over the twelve months being measured. 
 Table 30 summarizes the estimated effect on net interest income and EVE from changing interest rates as measured against a flat rate (no interest rate change) instantaneous parallel shock scenario over a twelve-month period utilizing an interest sensitivity (GAP) analysis based on the Company s specific mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes requires numerous assumptions, which are based upon our experience and published industry experience. Such assumptions may not necessarily reflect the manner or timing in which our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities respond to changes in market rates. Because these assumptions are inherently uncertain, actual results will differ from simulated results. 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness as of September 30, 2024 of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such controls.
