million of principal to common stock. In March 2024, the
holders exchanged the remaining May 2023 Convertible Notes of million for Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Preferred
Stock with a 1,000 per share value and an initial conversation price of 133.00 per share for common stock (see Note 10). All
covenants from the Convertible Notes were terminated upon this exchange. 

As discussed further in Note 7 below, on May 22,
2024, the Company issued Senior Notes with an aggregate principal amount of due (the May 2024 Notes for net proceeds of . The holders of the May 2024 Notes also received fully vested warrants (the May 2024 Note Warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of per share. The May 2024 Note Warrants are
exercisable beginning November 23, 2024 and expire . 

On July 12, 2024, Company sold shares
of the Company s common stock at a purchase price of 29.20 per share and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common
stock at 29.19992 per pre-funded warrant. The Company received net proceeds of . Proceeds from this offering were used to
repay the May 2024 Notes. 

Management anticipates that our cash on hand as
of September 30, 2024 plus the cash expected to be generated from operations will not be sufficient to fund planned operations beyond
one year from the date of the issuance of the financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. There
can be no assurance that additional funding, if needed, would be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all. These factors
raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Nasdaq Compliance 

On July 5, 2023, the Company received a notice
from Nasdaq that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq s Listing Rule 5550(b)(2), which requires that it maintain a market value
of listed securities MVLS of 35 million. MVLS is calculated by multiplying the Company s shares outstanding by
the closing price of its common stock. On December 19, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq that it was not in compliance with
Nasdaq s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid price of its common stock had been below 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive
business days. 

On December 26, 2023, the Company was notified
by Nasdaq that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq s Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii) as the closing bid price of our common stock
had been below 0.10 for ten consecutive trading days from December 11, 2023 through December 22, 2023 and was subject to delisting on
January 2, 2024. On January 4, 2024, the Company received notice from Nasdaq that it did not meet the MVLS requirement and it was subject
to delisting. The Company submitted a hearing request to Nasdaq s Hearings Department for both of these matters, which stayed the
suspension of the Company s common stock. The Company participated in a hearing with Nasdaq s Hearings Department on March
26, 2024 and on April 2, 2024, they informed the Company that the Company has until June 24, 2024 to regain compliance with the above
listing rules. 

On June 11, 2024, the Company received a notice
from the Nasdaq that the Company no longer met the minimum 500,000 publicly held shares requirement for Nasdaq and, as such, it no longer
complied with Listing Rule 5550(a)(4). Furthermore, the notice indicated that this matter would serve as an additional basis for delisting
the Company s securities from Nasdaq, that the Panel would consider this matter in their decision regarding the Company s
continued listing on Nasdaq, and that the Company should present its views with respect to this additional deficiency to the Panel in
writing no later than June 18, 2024. On June 18, 2024, the Company submitted a letter to Nasdaq notifying them that the Company was in
compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(4) due to the issuance of additional shares of common stock from the conversion of preferred stock
to common stock by certain Preferred Stockholders. 

On July 17, 2024, Nasdaq informed the Company
that it had regained compliance with the above listing rules but will continue to be monitored for ongoing compliance. 

Employment Matters 

On January 13, 2024, the Company s Chief
Executive Officer CEO ), Jordan Davis, resigned his employment with the Company effective February 2, 2024. The Company

Impact of Russia and Ukraine Conflict 

On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine.
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine could impact the availability of nickel, an element used in the production of lithium ion cells
used in batteries that power our vehicles. The shortage of these cells could have an impact on our ability to produce vehicles to meet
our customers demands. In addition, sanctions against Russia could impact the price of elements, including nickel, that are used
in the production of batteries which would result in higher costs to produce our vehicles. These sanctions have also impacted the U.S.
and global economies and could result in an economic recession which could cause a broader disruption to the Company s supply chain
and distribution network and customer demand for our products. 

Results for the interim periods in this report

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary to present
fairly our interim consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the

Debt 

The fair value of the Company s
debt, which approximated the carrying value of the Company s debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Factors that the
Company considered when estimating the fair value of its debt included market conditions, and term of the debt. The level of the debt
would be considered as Level 2. 

The Company relies on the guidance
provided by ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , to classify certain convertible instruments. The Company first
determines whether a financial instrument should be classified as a liability. The Company will determine the liability classification
if the financial instrument is mandatorily redeemable, or if the financial instrument, other than outstanding shares, embodies a conditional
obligation that the Company must or may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares. 

The Company accounts for derivative
instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC Topic 815 ), and all derivative instruments
are reflected as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company uses estimates of fair value
to value its derivative instruments. Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between able and willing market participants. In general, the Company s policy in estimating fair values is to first look at observable
market prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets, where available. When these are not available, other inputs are
used to model fair value such as prices of similar instruments, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, default rates and credit
spreads, relying first on observable data from active markets. Depending on the availability of observable inputs and prices, different
valuation models could produce materially different fair value estimates. The values presented may not represent future fair values and
may not be realizable. The Company categorizes its fair value estimates in accordance with ASC Topic 820, based on the hierarchical framework
associated with the three levels or price transparency utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value as discussed above. 

Once the Company determines that a financial instrument
should not be classified as a liability, the Company determines whether the financial instrument should be presented between the liability
section and the equity section of the balance sheet temporary equity ). The Company will determine temporary equity classification
if the redemption of the financial instrument is outside the control of the Company (i.e. at the option of the holder). Otherwise, the
Company accounts for the financial instrument as permanent equity. 

Initial Measurement 

The Company records its financial
instruments classified as a liability, temporary equity or permanent equity at issuance at the fair value, or cash received. 

Subsequent Measurement -
Financial instruments classified as liabilities 

The Company records the fair
value of its financial instruments classified as liabilities at each subsequent measurement date. The changes in fair value of its financial
instruments classified as liabilities are recorded as other expense/income. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the fair value
of derivatives for instruments with embedded conversion features and for free standing warrants as discussed further in Note 8. 

Additional Disclosures Regarding Fair Value
Measurements 

The carrying value of cash,
accounts receivable, inventory, other assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short-term
maturity of those items. 

Warrant Liabilities and Convertible Liabilities 

The fair value of the derivative liabilities and
warrant liabilities is classified as Level 3 within the Company s fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 8, Derivative Instruments,
for further discussion of the measurement of fair value of the derivatives and their underlying assumptions. 

which included a payment
of 370,000 in March 2024 and 100,000 monthly for seventeen months starting April 2024. The settlement was recorded in the financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The balance of the liability as of September 30, 2024, is . On October 2, 2024,
the Company and the manufacturer amended the settlement agreement and the Company agreed to pay the manufacturer by October 31,
2024 to fully settle the remaining payments under the March 2024 agreement and to return any remaining spare parts and finished goods
held by the Company in its Texas warehouse. The Company will recognize a reduction of expense of in cost of goods sold in the
three months and year ended December 31, 2024 related to this amendment. All Volcon Youth inventory was written off as of June 30, 2024. 

In June 2024, the Company was notified by the
manufacturer of a suspension component for the Stag that due to the Company s initial production forecast provided by the third
party manufacturer of the Stag, the vendor had acquired raw materials to fulfill several months worth of this component needed
for the forecast. Although the Company had provided updated forecasts to the third party manufacturer of the Stag, the revised forecasts
were not provided timely to this vendor. The Company entered into an agreement to pay for the excess raw materials by making weekly payments
in the amount of 15,704 over an eighteen-month period once the Company validates the inventory quantities and amounts paid by the vendor.
In August 2024, the Company and the manufacturer determined that the inventory quantities and amount were less than the initial amount
and adjusted the weekly payments to 13,791. The Company initially recorded an expense of in cost of goods sold for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2024 and subsequently recorded an expense reduction of in the three months ended September 30, 2024
after validation of the inventory quantities and value as well as an accrual for additional inventory purchases required under the agreement.
The short-term and long-term liability as of September 30, 2024 is and , respectively. 

Finished goods 

Total inventory 

In September 2024, the Company lowered the sales price of the Grunt
EVO that are sold to dealers and distributors. Since the unit sales price is below the unit cost the Company paid to the manufacturer,
the Company wrote down the Grunt EVO finished goods inventory and recorded an expense of . 

In October 2024, the Company notified the
manufacturer of the Stag that the Company intended to terminate the manufacturing agreement between the parties due to breaches of
the manufacturing agreement arising from significant costs increases over the original contracted cost, quality issues resulting in
significant costs incurred by the Company for rework, manufacturing assistance required to be provided by the Company s
employees to program vehicles, significant delays in production and low production volumes. In response to the Company s
notice of termination, the manufacturer has indicated that it does not believe the assertions set forth in the Company s
notice are accurate and has asserted that it believes the Company lacks good cause to terminate the agreement. In addition, the
manufacturer has asserted that it believes the Company has breached the manufacturing agreement and that the manufacturer intends to
file a lawsuit claiming direct and consequential damages against the Company, including for lost profits, in an aggregate amount of
 26.7 million. The Company intends to vigorously defend any claims brought by the manufacturer. 

Pursuant to the manufacturing agreement, the
manufacturer has 60 days to cure the breaches indicated in the notice of termination, to the extent the breaches are curable. The
Company asked the manufacturer to provide a plan for curing its breaches and to provide assurances that the manufacturer would be
able to perform. The manufacturer has not responded to this request from the Company. The Company evaluated the probability that the
manufacturer could remediate the breach within 60 days of notification and concluded that it would not be probable. Therefore the
Company has written down all of the Stag parts inventory as the Company does not believe that it would be able to recover the
inventory since it is in the manufacturer s possession, and even it could the Company does not believe that it could find
another manufacturer who could build the Stag without the Company incurring additional significant costs to have the manufacturer
set up a production facility. In addition, the Company wrote off all prepaid deposits and advances paid to vendors and the
manufacturer of the Stag. The total write off related to Stag inventory, prepaid inventory and advances was .
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the unlikely event the manufacturer is able to cure the breaches set forth in the notice of
termination, the Company would continue to sell the Stag in accordance with the terms of the manufacturing agreement. 

In June 2023, the Company wrote down all remaining Torrot branded

The Company evaluated the issuance of the New
Notes and Exchange Notes and related warrants and determined that the Convertible Notes were extinguished based on the conclusion that
the terms of the New Notes and Exchange Notes are substantially different from the Convertible Notes in accordance with ASC 470, Debt .
In addition, the Company recognized a loss on the extinguishment of the Convertible Notes based on the carrying value of the Convertible
Notes at the transaction date, plus gross proceeds received from the issuance of New Notes and New Warrants, less the fair value of the

limitations, providing that no conversion may be made if, after giving effect to the conversion, the holder, together with any of its
affiliates, would own in excess of 9.99 of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock after giving effect to such conversion.
The Company had the option to force conversion of the Series A and Series B Notes but the weighted average price of the Company s
common stock did not equal or exceed the amounts specified in the May 2023 Note agreements while these notes were outstanding.

such conversion, the holder or any of its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 4.99 of the outstanding shares of the Company s
common stock immediately after giving effect to such exercise. The May 2023 Warrants and Reload Warrants provide the holders the right
to exercise these warrants on a non-cash basis if the Company does not have an effective registration statement for the underlying shares
of common stock. 

Holders of the May 2023 Notes, the May 2023 Warrants
and Reload Warrants did not have voting rights to the extent they did not convert their notes or exercise their warrants.

offering and sold shares of common stock at per share. The holders of the May 2023 Notes waived their right to reduce the
conversion price to the equity issuance price and agreed to reduce the conversion price to 99,000.00 per share. The exercise price of

In addition to the above factors, the Company
also used a probability assessment for the initial and August 3, 2023 valuation to evaluate whether stockholder approval would be received
to lower the conversion and exercise prices. The Company utilized a 50/50 assessment that stockholders would or would not approve the
lower conversion and exercise price. Management notes that at the time of the assessment, the stockholder vote had not yet started therefore
there was no data to determine whether one scenario was more likely than another. Since the stockholders approved the lower conversion
and exercise price on August 3, 2023, no probability assessment was used. 

Based on the above factors, the estimated fair
value of the Company s derivative liabilities carried at fair value at May 24, 2023 and August 3, 2023 as follows: 

Conversion Feature - Series A Exchange Notes 

Conversion Feature - Series B Exchange Notes 

New Warrants 

Exchange Warrants 

Total 

On August 3, 2023, stockholders approved the adjustment
of the conversion price of the New Notes and Exchange Notes and the exercise price of the New Warrants and Exchange Warrants. The conversion
and exercise prices can adjust to a floor of 0.22 per share based on certain events defined in the agreements related to these instruments.
The Company concluded that as of August 3, 2023, the conversion feature of the May 2023 Notes and the May 2023 Warrants are no longer
derivative liabilities and reclassified them to equity on August 3, 2023. The Company recognized a (loss) gain of and 
for the change in the fair values of the conversion features of the May 2023 Notes for the three and nine months ended September, 30,
2023, respectively. 

The Company
calculated the fair value of May 2023 Warrants at August 3, 2023, and recognized a gain of and in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The total gain recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for the May 2023 Notes conversion
features and May 2023 Warrants was . 

Series A and Series B Warrants 

As discussed in Note 10 below, the Company issued
Series A and Series B Warrants (the November 2023 Warrants in connection with the sale of common units and pre-funded warrant
units. Under the terms of the November 2023 Warrants, the number and exercise price are subject to adjustment if the Company completes
certain transactions specified in these warrant agreements. In addition, the Series A Warrants have a cashless exercise provision, if
approved by stockholders, that would allow holders to cashless exercise one warrant for three shares of the Company s common stock.
Such adjustments were subject to stockholder approval (which was received on January 12, 2024) and are further described in Note 10. 

The Company has determined that these warrants
should be classified as liabilities and has used a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value. The following assumptions were used
in the valuations: 

Volatility 

Risk free interest rate 

Dividend yield 

Warrant term (years) 

Time to future transaction (years) 

Future transaction probability 

In addition to the above factors, the Company
also used a probability assessment for the initial and December 31, 2023 valuation to evaluate whether stockholder approval would be received
on January 12, 2024 to lower the conversion and exercise prices. Management notes that at the time of the assessment, the stockholder
vote had not yet started but there was a requirement in the offering that the board of directors, management, and a significant stockholder
vote in favor of these adjustments which included approximately 20.1 of the shares outstanding as of the transaction date. Further, significant
investors in the transaction held shares acquired prior to the record date for eligible stockholders to vote. Although these same investors
could not vote the shares received in the November 17, 2023 offering, they could abstain from voting those shares for the stockholder
vote and such shares would count towards whether a quorum of shares was received to hold the special meeting for the stockholder approval.
Finally, management notes that approval was overwhelmingly positive to adjust the conversion price for the May 2023 Notes and May 2023
Warrants and exercise prices. The Company concluded that it was 100 likely that stockholders would approve the provisions to adjust the
number of warrants and exercise price. 

Based on the above factors, the estimated fair
value of the Series A and Series B Warrant liabilities at December 31, 2023 is as follows: 

Series B Warrant 

The Company allocated the gross proceeds from
the issuance of the common units and pre-funded warrant units based on the relative fair values from the November 17, 2023 valuation resulting
in a value of and being allocated to the Series A and Series B warrants, respectively. An allocation of the issuance
costs from the offering was made based on the relative fair values of the common stock, pre-funded warrants, Series A and Series B warrants
and issuance costs of that were allocated to the Series A and Series B Warrants were expensed in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Subsequent to the approval by stockholders of
the cashless exercise provision of the Series A Warrant, the fair value of each Series A Warrant is the value of three shares of the Company s
common stock. Based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on September 30, 2024 of , the fair value of each Series
A Warrant is and based on the total number of warrants outstanding of , the warrant liability for Series A Warrants is 
at September 30, 2024. 

As discussed in Note 10 below, on May 17, 2024,
certain terms of the Series B Warrants were amended, including a cashless exercise provision, which resulted in the Series B warrants
no longer being liabilities. The fair value of each Series B warrant is the value of the closing stock price of the Company times 0.81,
the cashless exercise exchange ratio. Based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on May 17, 2024 of , the fair
value of each Series B Warrant is . A loss of was recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, for the change
in fair value of the Series B Warrants from December 31, 2023 to May 17, 2024. The fair value of the Series B Warrants of 
as of May 17, 2024 was reclassified to equity. 

As discussed in Note 10, certain holders of the
Series A and Series B Warrants exercised their warrants. The Company reclassified the fair value of the Series A Warrants exercised on
a cashless basis to stockholders equity. The Company recognized a gain of from the exercise of the Series B Warrants based on
the proceeds received from the exercise and the estimated fair value of the Series B Warrants on the date of exercise. 

The following represents the activity associated
with the Series A and Series B Warrants for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

Management currently believes that since the Company
has a history of losses it is more likely than not that the deferred tax regarding the loss carry forwards and other temporary differences
will not be realized in the foreseeable future. Due to the impact of the reverse stock split in June 2024 on the adjusted number of outstanding
options and exercise prices, the Company concluded that it is a remote possibility that any options will be exercised and therefore wrote
off the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance for stock-based compensation. The utilization of the Company s net operating
losses and credit carryovers may be subject to limitation due to the change in ownership provisions under Section 382 of
the Internal Revenue Code. The Company s cumulative net operating loss carry forward of million as of September 30, 2024,
may be limited in future years depending on future taxable income in any given fiscal year. The net operating losses can be carried forward
indefinitely. 

The Company has recorded no liability for income
taxes associated with unrecognized tax benefits at the date of adoption and has not recorded any liability associated with unrecognized
tax benefits. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any interest or penalty in regard to any unrecognized benefit.

Overview 

We are an all-electric, off-road
powersports vehicle company developing electric two-wheeled E-Bikes and motorcycles and four-wheeled and utility terrain vehicles, or
UTVs, also known as side-by-sides, along with a line of upgrades and accessories. In October 2020, we began building and testing prototypes
for our future offerings with two off-road motorcycles the Grunt and the Runt. Our motorcycles feature unique frame designs protected
by design patents. Additional utility and design patents have been filed for other aspects of Volcon s vehicles. 

Two-Wheeled Products 

We began selling the Grunt
in September 2021. In August 2022, we ceased manufacturing of the Grunt and we outsourced the manufacturing of the remaining Grunts and
the 2023 Grunt EVO to the same third party manufacturer as the Stag UTV discussed below. The 2023 Grunt EVO has replaced the Grunt and
has a belt drive rather than a chain drive as well as an updated rear suspension. We began selling the Grunt EVO in the third quarter
of 2023. We determined in the first quarter of 2024 that we would not develop the Runt for production and terminated efforts to develop
this product. 

In January 2023, we began
selling Volcon co-branded youth electric motorcycles under a distribution agreement with Torrot Electric Europa S.A. Torrot ).
In December 2023 we notified Torrot that we were terminating our agreements due to continued lower than expected sales at significantly
discounted pricing. In conjunction with a settlement agreement with Torrot we ceased selling these motorcycles as of June 30, 2024. 

In the fourth quarter of 2022,
we began selling an E-Bike, the Brat which is manufactured by a third party. The Brat is a class 2 E-Bike and can be used on-road or off-road. 

Beginning in the second quarter
of 2024, we began evaluating other potential electric motorcycle offerings. We are determining what features and specifications would
be included for new offerings including considering a street legal version that would be dual purpose as an on-road/off-road motorcycle
(not highway legal). We have identified one new model which we are working on developing with a third party manufacturer. We do not have
prototypes yet, but once received we will test them to evaluate the feasibility to produce and sell them. We will continue to evaluate
other potential two-wheel product offerings throughout the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. 

35 

Utility Terrain Vehicles (UTVs) 

In July 2022, we
announced we were expanding our offerings with the introduction of the first of our Volcon UTV models, the Stag. We delivered the
first Stag to a customer in February 2024. The Stag is being manufactured by a third party and incorporates electrification units,
which include batteries, drive units and control modules provided by General Motors. Beginning in June 2022, we took non-binding
pre-production orders which were cancelable prior to delivery. In October 2024, the Company notified the manufacturer of the Stag
that the Company intended to terminate the manufacturing agreement between the parties due to breaches of the manufacturing
agreement arising from significant costs increases over the original contracted cost, quality issues resulting in significant costs
incurred by the Company for rework, manufacturing assistance required to be provided by the Company s employees to program
vehicles, significant delays in production and low production volumes. In response to the Company s notice of termination, the
manufacturer has indicated that it does not believe the assertions set forth in the Company s notice are accurate and has
asserted that it believes the Company lacks good cause to terminate the agreement. In addition, the manufacturer has asserted that
it believes the Company has breached the manufacturing agreement and that the manufacturer intends to file a lawsuit claiming direct
and consequential damages against the Company, including for lost profits, in an aggregate amount of 26.7 million. The Company
intends to vigorously defend any claims brought by the manufacturer. 

Pursuant to the
manufacturing agreement, the manufacturer has 60 days to cure the breaches indicated in the notice of termination, to the extent the
breaches are curable. The Company asked the manufacturer to provide a plan for curing its breaches and to provide assurances that
the manufacturer would be able to perform. The manufacturer has not responded to this request from the Company. The Company
evaluated the probability that the manufacturer could remediate the breach within 60 days of notification and concluded that it
would not be probable. Therefore the Company has written down all of the Stag parts inventory as the Company does not believe that
it would be able to recover the inventory since it is in the manufacturer s possession and even it could the Company does not
believe that it could find another manufacturer who could build the Stag without the Company incurring additional significant costs
to have the manufacturer set up a production facility. In addition, the Company wrote off all prepaid deposits and advances paid to
vendors and the manufacturer of the Stag. The total write off related to Stag inventory, prepaid inventory and advances was
 8,712,644. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the unlikely event the manufacturer is able to cure the breaches set forth in the
notice of termination, the Company would continue to sell the Stag in accordance with the terms of the manufacturing agreement. 

Beginning in the second quarter
of 2024, we began discussions with various third party manufacturers of UTVs to identify models that we could purchase that are electric,
or have internal combustion engine versions that could be modified to all electric. These models would be primarily used for utility purposes,
have two or three passenger options, a dump bed or flatbed for hauling cargo, with speeds up to 30 miles per hour. These models may also
include an enclosed cab with optional air conditioning. 

In the three months ended
September 30, 2024, we have signed an agreement with a manufacturer to distribute one of these utility UTV models, the VLCN HF1 in North
America for five years, which includes a royalty agreement with the manufacturer for them to distribute the vehicle outside of North America.
Royalties would commence in the third year of this agreement. We have also signed another agreement with a different manufacturer to distribute
other light UTV models, the VLCN MN1 in the United States. 

Customers 

We initially sold the
Grunt directly to consumers but ceased in November 2021. Since November 2021, we have sold the Grunt, Grunt EVO, Stag and related
accessories through powersports dealers. As of November 11, 2024, we have 110 active dealers. Dealers can order any of our available
products provided they are current on their accounts receivable and are within their established credit limit. We are offering
dealers payment terms of 30 to 90 days to make larger purchases of our vehicles. We have entered into an accounts receivable
factoring arrangement to allow us the ability to generate cash for working capital. We have agreements with third party financing
companies to provide financing to qualified customers of each dealer. There is no recourse to us or the dealer if the dealer s
customer defaults on the financing agreement with the third party. We also sell the Brat to some powersports dealers as well as
bicycle retailers and directly to consumers through our website, where consumers can have the Brat delivered to a location of their
choosing in the continental U.S. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we began selling the Grunt EVO through our website where
continental U.S. customers can pay a deposit and complete their purchase at one of our U.S. powersports dealer locations. Grunt EVO
customers who are not located in a state where we have a powersports dealer or within a reasonable distance from a powersports
dealer in their state, can have the Grunt EVO shipped directly to a location they specify. 

36 

In addition to selling our
two-wheeled vehicles through powersports dealers, bicycle retailers and direct to consumers through our website, we also sell them internationally
through importers. Each importer buys vehicles by the container and sells vehicles and accessories to local dealers or directly to consumers.
Local dealers or the importer will provide warranty and repair services for vehicles purchased in their country. As of November 11, 2024,
we have signed agreements with six importers in Latin America, one importer for the Caribbean Region, collectively referred to herein
as the LATAM importers, one importer in New Zealand, and one distributor in Japan to sell our two-wheel vehicles and accessories in their
assigned countries/markets. Through the remainder of 2024 and in 2025, we expect to expand our global sales of our vehicles and accessories
beyond our current distributor base. 

Manufacturers 

We outsource the manufacturing
of all of our vehicles and accessories to third party manufacturers and suppliers. The estimated fulfillment of all two-wheeled and UTV
orders we have received, or will receive, assumes that our third party manufacturers can successfully meet our order quantities and deadlines.
We have experienced delays due to our third party manufacturers being unable to timely meet our order deadlines, and there is no assurance
that we will not experience delays in the future until such time as we are able to source products from multiple manufacturers or from
larger, more established manufacturers. If they are unable to satisfy orders on a timely basis, our customers may cancel their orders.
Also, due to the limited number of third party manufacturers who manufacture our products, if any one of them experiences financial hardship
and cannot manufacture our products, our customers may cancel their orders which will harm our sales. All of our products are manufactured
internationally. If there is a change in import laws, including an increase in tariffs, the cost of our products will increase. We could
also experience delays in receiving shipments of our products if there are delays in getting carriers to ship our products or delays at
the port of entry.

three months ended September 30, 2024 were 10,294,720, including payroll costs of 56,996 for employees performing product fulfillment,
logistics management, and service and warranty. Product costs for Brats, MN1s, and Grunt EVOs sold during the period were 300,880 (before

off of Stag inventory and prepaid deposits. As discussed above in Overview Utility Terrain Vehicles (UTVs) , the
Company wrote off all Stag parts inventory, including prepaid inventory deposits resulting in expense of 8,712,644. The Company also
wrote down the Grunt EVO finished goods inventory by 535,013 due to the Company lowering the sales price to dealers and distributors.
Offsetting expenses includes an adjustment of 136,121 to the vendor settlement for Stag suspension components recorded in the three months
ended June 30, 2024 after auditing the inventory quantities and costs. The Company also recorded 175,000 as an offset to expenses for
the partial recovery of a previously written off prepaid inventory deposit. Facilities costs related to operations were 98,254. Loss
on disposal of Runt tooling and other equipment was 195,635.

logistics management, and service and warranty. Product costs for Brats and Grunt EVOs, sold during the period were 1,105,054 and 1,515,175
(before the finished goods inventory write down discussed below), respectively. Volcon Youth product costs were 186,813 before the additional
expense of 81,911 for the write down of all Volcon Youth inventory as the Company could no longer sell Volcon Youth motorcycles or parts
after June 30, 2024. Stag product costs were 944,299, which includes an expense of 112,168 for the already delivered and future delivery
of vehicles to a customer where the Company agreed to provide additional units at a sales price less than the manufactured cost of the
units. As noted above, the Company also wrote off all Stag parts inventory and prepaid inventory deposits resulting in an expense of 8,712,644.
The Company also recognized an expense of 976,420 for a settlement agreement with a vendor who supplies certain suspension components
for the Stag. The Company also wrote down the Grunt EVO finished goods inventory by 535,013 due to the Company lowering the sales price
to dealers and distributors. The Company recorded a loss on disposal of assets of 817,736 primarily related to Stag, Grunt EVO and Runt
tooling. The Company also recorded 175,000 as an offset to expenses for the partial recovery of a previously written off prepaid inventory
deposit. 

Cost of goods sold for the
three months ended September 30, 2023 were 3,542,468 including payroll costs of 287,117 and stock-based compensation of 131,526 for
employees performing warehouse and logistics management and quality control testing. Product costs for Brats, Grunt EVOs, and Volcon Youth
sold during the period were 555,265, 96,332 and 40,018 (before net realizable value write down), respectively. We recorded a write
down of Volcon Youth motorcycles of 1,622,262 to reduce their costs to the expected net realizable value. We recorded an expense of 19,500
related to fees paid to cancel purchase orders to reduce raw material quantities. Facilities costs were 126,501 for our warehouse facility
and third party warehousing costs. The Company also recorded an expense of 350,000 due to a reduction of the credit per Grunt EVO our
third party manufacturer will provide for inventory previously provided to it. The credit was reduced to 1,250 from 1,600 due to inventory
provided by the Company that is in excess of the 1,000 units. Future credits could be received if the Company has the third party manufacturer
build more than 1,000 units. 

38 

Cost of goods sold for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, were 5,107,096. Costs include payroll costs of 969,461 and stock-based compensation of 487,605
for share-based awards for employees performing warehouse and logistics management and quality control testing. Product costs for Brats,
Grunts, Grunt EVOs, and Volcon Youth, sold during the period were 1,150,905, 459,690, 97,051, and 295,427 (before inventory write
down), respectively. We recorded write downs of Volcon Youth and Torrot Youth motorcycles of 1,622,262 to reduce the inventory value
to its expected net realizable value. We recorded expense of 158,252 related to fees paid to cancel purchase orders to reduce raw material
quantities, which was offset by a reduction in the net realizable valuation expense of 198,061 the Company was recording for excess quantities
of raw materials that it was no longer obligated to purchase by paying these fees. Also, the one-year warranty for parts and labor on
Grunts sold prior to September 30, 2022 expired (excluding the battery which is warranted for 2 years) and an adjustment to reduce the
warranty accrual in the amount of 459,800 was recorded which reduced cost of goods sold. Facilities costs were 337,658 for our warehouse
facility and third party warehousing costs. Shipping costs were reduced by 347,729 due to the reversal of an accrual for shipping costs
and tariffs expected to be incurred to ship our Grunt raw materials and work-in-process inventory to our third party manufacturer in Mexico
which was no longer needed. 

For the remainder of 2024
we expect revenue and cost of goods sold to increase due to the expected increase in sales of the Brat and Grunt EVOs. To the extent the
new products, the MN1s and HF1s, arrive and sales begin before the end of 2024, revenue and costs of sales may also increase. Additional
cost savings may be realized if the third party manufacturer for these vehicles can source or manufacture parts at a lower cost. The increase
in costs for products will partially be offset by reductions in cost for salaries and benefits due to reductions in headcount completed
in 2023.

activities was 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting of 0.8 million of purchases of equipment and tooling
offset by proceeds of 0.1 million received for the sale of two vehicles. 

Cash provided by financing activities 

Cash provided by financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 10.2 million and was primarily related to the net proceeds from the issuance
of common stock and pre funded warrants in July 2024 for net proceeds of 10.8 million and net proceeds from the issuance May 2024 Senior
Notes and May 2024 Note Warrants of 2.3 million offset by the repayment of the May 2024 Senior Notes of 2.9 million. 

Cash provided by financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 9.0 million and was related primarily to proceeds from the public offerings
of 42 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of 4.6 million and issuance of convertible notes in a private offering with a principal
amount of 4.9 million and net proceeds of 3.9 million. We also received proceeds of 0.5 million from proceeds from the exchange of
11 warrants for new warrants . In addition, we used 0.1 million from proceeds received from the sale of two vehicles to pay off the related
notes payable on the vehicles. 

Our continuation as a going
concern is dependent upon our ability to attain profitable operations and if necessary, obtain continued financial support from the issuance
of debt or equity. As of September 30, 2024, we had incurred an accumulated deficit of 161.1 million since inception. 

42 

Management anticipates that
our cash on hand as of September 30, 2024 plus the net proceeds from the equity offering completed in July 2024 and cash expected to be
generated from operations will not be sufficient to fund planned operations during the near term and not beyond one year from the date
of the issuance of the financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. To continue our operations,
we currently estimate that we will need to obtain additional funding by the first quarter of 2025. We do not have commitments for any
such financing, and there can be no assurance that such additional funding would be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at
all. If we are unable to raise additional near-term financing, we will be required to modify or cease our operations. These factors raise
substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. 

JOBS Act Accounting Election 

The recently enacted JOBS
Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting
standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. 

We have implemented all new
accounting pronouncements that are in effect and may impact our financial statements and we do not believe that there are any other new
accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially
differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: 

Derivative Warrant Liabilities 

We do not use derivative instruments
to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments, including conversion
features of our convertible debt and warrants issued in connection with our convertible debt, to determine if such instruments are derivatives
or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480 ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The classification of derivative financial instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded
as liabilities or as equity, is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. 

We account for the Series
A Warrants (and the Series B Warrants until May 17, 2024 when they were modified) issued in connection with the November 2023 Common Units
and Pre-funded Warrant Units as a financial liability in accordance with ASC 815. Accordingly, we recognized these financial liabilities
at fair value initially and adjust it to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance
sheet date until exercised or until warrant exercise price and number of warrants become fixed (as was the case with the Series B Warrants
upon modification), and any change in fair value is recognized in the statement of operations. The fair value of these financial instruments
were initially measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Series A Warrant measurement was changed once the shareholders
approved the alternative cashless exercise provision of the Series A Warrants to allow a holder to cashless exercise the warrant and receive
three shares of common stock. The measurement of the Series A Warrants is now based on the closing price of the Company s common
stock multiplied by three. The Series A Warrants are classified as current liabilities as the timing of their exercise is at the discretion
of the warrant holders and the warrants were fully vested as of the date they were issued. 

The modification of the Series
B Warrants fixed the number of warrants. One of the provisions of the modification also included a provision that allowed a Series B Warrant
holder to cashless exercise the warrant and receive .81 of a share of common stock. We calculated the fair value of the Series B Warrants
on the date of the modification based on the modified terms. The Series B Warrant valuation was based on our closing stock price on the
modification date multiplied by .81. We recognized a gain in the statement of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024
and reclassified the liability to equity. 

43 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports
we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the appropriate
time periods, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer, who serves as our principal executive
officer, and Chief Financial Officer, who serves as our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding
required disclosure. We, under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. 

Based on that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
disclosures as we have previously missed filing certain forms timely and we have not implemented and tested controls and procedures to
conclude that we have remediated this deficiency. Notwithstanding this conclusion, we believe that our unaudited consolidated financial
statements contained in this Quarterly Report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
covered thereby in all material respects. Management is working to identify corrective actions for the weakness and will periodically
re-evaluate the need to add personnel and implement improved review procedures. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes to our
internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

44 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time in the ordinary
course of our business, we may be involved in legal proceedings, the outcomes of which may not be determinable. The results of litigation
are inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation,
require significant amounts of management time and result in diversion of significant resources. We are not able to estimate an aggregate
amount or range of reasonably possible losses for those legal matters for which losses are not probable and estimable. We have insurance
policies covering potential losses where such coverage is cost effective. 

Although the Company is not presently a party to any material legal
proceedings, as described in Item 2. Management s Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations
 Overview - Utility Terrain Vehicles (UTVs) the manufacturer of the Company s Stag vehicle has threatened legal proceedings
against the Company. In October 2024, the Company notified the manufacturer that the Company intended to terminate the manufacturing agreement
between the parties due to breaches of the manufacturing agreement arising from significant costs increases over the original contracted
cost, quality issues resulting in significant costs incurred by the Company for rework, manufacturing assistance required to be provided
by the Company s employees to program vehicles, significant delays in production and low production volumes. In response to the
Company s notice of termination, the manufacturer has indicated that it does not believe the assertions set forth in the Company s
notice are accurate and has asserted that it believes the Company lacks good cause to terminate the agreement. In addition, the manufacturer
has asserted that it believes the Company has breached the manufacturing agreement and that the manufacturer intends to file a lawsuit
claiming direct and consequential damages against the Company, including for lost profits, in an aggregate amount of 26.7 million. The
Company intends to vigorously defend any claims brought by the manufacturer. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Except as set forth below,
there have been no material changes to the risk factors included in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024, and our Form 10-Q
for the period ended June 30, 2024, each of which is accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. 

Our ability to continue as a going concern
requires that we obtain sufficient funding to finance our operations in the near-term. 

We anticipate that our cash
on hand as of September 30, 2024 plus the cash raised from the July 2024 equity offering and cash expected to be generated from operations
will not be sufficient to fund planned operations for one year from the issuance of the September 30, 2024 financial statements. To continue
our operations, we currently estimate that we will need to obtain additional funding by the first quarter of 2025. We can provide no assurance
that such funding would be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise additional proceeds, we will be required
to modify or cease our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We have in the past failed to maintain compliance
with all applicable continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, and if we fail to maintain compliance with all applicable
continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market in the future, we will not be afforded traditional cure periods under Nasdaq
rules and our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq, which could have an adverse impact on the liquidity and market price of our common
stock. 

On December 19, 2023, we were
notified by the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq that we
were not in compliance with Nasdaq s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid price of our common stock had been below 1.00
per share for 30 consecutive business days. On January 4, 2024, the Staff notified us that the market value of our listed securities had
been below the minimum 35,000,000 required for continued listing as set forth in Nasdaq s Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) for the previous
180 calendar days and served as an additional basis for delisting. 

45 

We submitted a hearing request
to Nasdaq s Hearings Department, which stayed the suspension of our common stock. The hearing was held on March 26, 2024. On April
2, 2024, we received notification from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel Panel that it had granted an extension until June 24,
2024, to demonstrate compliance with Listing Rules 5550(a)(2) and 5550(b)(1) (which requires at least 2.5 million in shareholders 
equity), subject to certain conditions. 

On July 17, 2024, we received
a letter from the Nasdaq Office of General Counsel confirming the decision of the Panel that we had demonstrated compliance with the requirements
for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, but that we will be subject to a Discretionary Panel Monitor for a period of one year.
As such, in the event that we have another deficiency or deficiencies, we will immediately go back into Nasdaq s hearings process.
In the event that the Nasdaq Hearings Department does not grant us an extension to demonstrate compliance our common stock would be delisted
from Nasdaq and trading of our common stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board
established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such an event, it could become more difficult
to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by
securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Also, it may be difficult
for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on a major exchange. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

Except as previously reported
on Form 8-K, we did not sell any equity securities during the period covered by the report that were not registered under the Securities
Act. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

None. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 

During the quarter ended September
30, 2024, no director or officer or any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as
each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
