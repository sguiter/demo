Portfolio
and Investment Activity 

Our
portfolio is currently comprised of a broad mix of loans, with diversity among investment size and industry focus. The Advisor s
team of professionals conducts due diligence on prospective investments during the underwriting process and is involved in structuring
the credit terms of our private middle market investments. Once an investment has been made, our Advisor closely monitors that portfolio
investment and takes a proactive approach to identify and address sector or company specific risks. The Advisor seeks to maintain a regular
dialogue with portfolio company management teams (as well as their owners, the majority of whom are private equity firms, where applicable),
reviews detailed operating and financial results on a regular basis (typically monthly or quarterly) and monitors current and projected
liquidity needs, in addition to other portfolio management activities. There are no assurances that we will achieve our investment objectives. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had investments in 67 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately 247.8 million, and
unfunded commitments to these portfolio companies of 26.4 million, and our portfolio consisted of 100 first lien senior secured loans. 

As of September 30, 2024, 100 of our debt investments had floating
interest rates. Our weighted average yields for debt investments at fair value and amortized cost were 11.8 and 12.0 , respectively. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our portfolio was invested across 22 different industries (Global Industry Classification GICS ,
Level 3 Industry). The largest industries in our portfolio as of September 30, 2024 were Trading Companies Distributors,
Food Products, Health Care Providers Services, and Commercial Services Supplies, which represented, as a percentage of our
portfolio of long-term investments, 22.1 , 12.1 , 10.5 and 7.7 , respectively, based on fair value. We are generalist investors and
the industries in which our portfolio companies operate may change over time. 

As

As

Portfolio
Internal Performance Ratings 

In
general, we employ a strategy designed to ensure early detection of potential issues at underlying borrowers, including monthly financial
reviews internal tracking memoranda, weekly watch list discussions and other like activities. We have designed a risk rating
system to aid in our portfolio management efforts where each investment is rated level 1-9, where Level 1 is the least risky 
and Level 9 is the most risky. This risk-rating system is quantitative in nature and aggregates criteria such as LTEV,
leverage levels and fixed charge coverage ratios FCCR (each measured at point-in-time and as relates to levels at the
close of the investment). 

The
table below sets forth our fair value of debt investments and number of portfolio companies, including percentage of each total, that
are on watch list as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our
liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from the net proceeds of any offering of our shares of common stock and from
cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. Our
primary use of cash will be investments in portfolio companies, payments of our expenses and payment of cash distributions to our stockholders. 

In
accordance with the 1940 Act, we are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness)
to total borrowings and other senior securities (and any preferred stock that we may issue in the future) of at least 150 . If this ratio
declines below 150 , we cannot incur additional leverage and could be required to sell a portion of our investments to repay some leverage
when it is disadvantageous to do so. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, we did not have any borrowings outstanding
under our subscription credit facility. We do not routinely use leverage, and there are many days when there are no borrowings
outstanding under our subscription credit facility. 

Over
the next twelve months, we expect that cash and cash equivalents, taken together with our available capacity under our credit facilities,
will be sufficient to conduct anticipated investment activities. Beyond twelve months, we expect that our cash and liquidity needs will
continue to be met by cash generated from our ongoing operations as well as financing activities. 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any
borrowings outstanding under our subscription credit facility and had cash and cash equivalents of 4.1 million (including short-term
investments). We do not routinely use leverage, and there are many days when there are no borrowings outstanding under our subscription
credit facility. As of November 7, 2024, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our subscription credit facility and had cash
and cash equivalents of 23.3 million. 

40 

Capital
Contributions 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued and sold 9,455 shares of our common stock related to capital called at an aggregate
purchase price of 50.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued and sold 9,549 shares of our common stock
related to capital called at an aggregate purchase price of 50.0 million. As of November 7, 2024, we had aggregate capital commitments
of 353.5 million and undrawn capital commitments from investors of 110.5 million 243.0 million or 68.7 funded). 

Credit
Facility 

Subscription
Credit Facility. We are party to a senior secured revolving credit facility (the Subscription Credit Facility that
has a total commitment of 25 million and a maturity date of February 21, 2025. The Subscription Credit Facility permits us to
borrow up to 25 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base which is calculated based on the unused capital commitments
of the investors meeting various eligibility requirements. The interest rate on the Subscription Credit Facility is equal to SOFR plus
an applicable spread of 2.25 per annum with no floor. We are also required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25 per annum on any unused
portion of the Subscription Credit Facility. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We did not
have any indebtedness outstanding under our Subscription Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an aggregate 26.4 million and 24.1 million, respectively, of unfunded commitments
to provide debt financing to our portfolio companies. Such commitments are generally subject to the satisfaction of certain financial
and nonfinancial covenants and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in our financial
statements. Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not
have any other off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining
such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of our
investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with our risk factors in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in this Quarterly Report. See Note 2 to our consolidated
financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, for more information on our critical accounting policies. 

Investment
Valuation 

Traded
Investments (Level 1 or Level 2) 

Investments
for which market quotations are readily available will typically be valued at those market quotations. Traded investments such as corporate
bonds, preferred stock, bank notes, loans or loan participations are valued by using the bid price provided by an independent pricing
service, by an independent broker, the agent bank, syndicate bank or principal market maker. When price quotes for investments are not
available, or such prices are stale or do not represent fair value in the judgment of our Advisor, fair market value will be determined
using our Advisor s valuation process for investments that are privately issued or otherwise restricted as to resale. 

Infrequently,
we may also invest, to a lesser extent, in equity securities purchased in conjunction with debt investments. While we anticipate these
equity securities to be issued by privately held companies, we may hold equity securities that are publicly traded. Equity securities
listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. NASDAQ are valued, except as indicated below, at the
last sale price on the business day as of which such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the securities
are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and ask prices on such day. Securities admitted to trade on the NASDAQ are valued at the
NASDAQ official closing price. Equity securities traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the
business day as of which such value is being determined at the close of the exchange representing the principal market for such securities.
Equity securities traded in the over-the-counter market, but excluding securities admitted to trading on the NASDAQ, are valued
at the closing bid prices. 

41 

Non-Traded Investments
(Level 3) 

Investments
that are privately issued or otherwise restricted as to resale, as well as any security for which (a) reliable market quotations
are not available in the judgment of our Advisor, or (b) the independent pricing service or independent broker does not provide
prices or provides a price that in the judgment of our Advisor is stale or does not represent fair value, shall each be valued in a manner
that most fairly reflects fair value of the security on the valuation date. We expect that a significant majority of our investments
will be Level 3 investments. Unless otherwise determined by the Advisor, the following valuation process is used for our Level 3
investments: 

Valuation Designee .
 The applicable investments will be valued no less frequently than quarterly by the Advisor, with new investments valued at the time
 such investment was made. The value of each Level 3 investment will be initially reviewed by the persons responsible for such portfolio
 company or investment. The Advisor will use a standardized template designed to approximate fair market value based on observable
 market inputs, updated credit statistics and unobservable inputs to determine a preliminary value. The Advisor will specify the titles
 of the persons responsible for determining the fair value of Company investments, including by specifying the particular functions
 for which they are responsible, and will reasonably segregate fair value determinations from the portfolio management of the Company
 such that the portfolio manager(s) may not determine, or effectively determine by exerting substantial influence on, the fair values
 ascribed to portfolio investments. 

Valuation Firm .
 Quarterly, a third-party valuation firm engaged by the Advisor reviews the valuation methodologies and calculations employed for
 each of the Company s investments that the Advisor has placed on the watch list and approximately 25 of the
 Company s remaining investments. The third-party valuation firm will review and independently value all of the Level 3 investments
 at least once per year, on a rolling twelve-month basis. The quarterly report issued by the third-party valuation firm will provide
 positive assurance on the fair values of the investments reviewed. 

Oversight . The Board
 has appointed the Advisor as the valuation designee for the Company for purposes of making determinations of fair value as permitted
 by Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. The Audit Committee shall aid the Board in overseeing the Advisor s fair valuation of securities
 that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available. The Audit Committee shall meet quarterly
 to review the fair value determinations, processes and written reports of the Advisor as part of the Board s oversight responsibilities. 

Refer
to Note 5 Fair Value for more information on the Company s valuation process. 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual
PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance, we generally will not accrue PIK interest
for accounting purposes if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a
receivable interest on loans and debt securities for accounting purposes if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest.
OIDs, market discounts or premiums are accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income. We record prepayment
premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. 

Related
Party Transactions 

Investment
Advisory Agreement. On December 16, 2021, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Advisor. On March 6, 2024, the
Board approved an additional one-year term of the Investment Advisory Agreement from March 16, 2024 to March 15, 2025. Our Advisor serves
as our investment advisor in accordance with the terms of our Investment Advisory Agreement. Payments under our Investment Advisory Agreement
in each reporting period will consist of a management fee equal to a percentage of the fair market value of investments, including, in
each case, assets purchased with borrowings under credit facilities, but excluding cash, U.S. government securities and commercial paper
instruments maturing within one year of purchase. 

For
services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we will pay a management fee quarterly in arrears to our Advisor based on
the of the fair market value of our investments including, in each case, assets purchased with borrowings under credit facilities, but
excluding cash, U.S. government securities and commercial paper instruments maturing within one year of purchase. 

42 

Administration
Agreement . On December 16, 2021, we entered into an Administration Agreement with our Advisor, which serves as our Administrator,
pursuant to which the Administrator will furnish us with administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations.
On March 6, 2024, the Board approved an additional one-year term of the Administration Agreement through March 15, 2025. 

The
Administrator will be reimbursed for administrative expenses it incurs on our behalf in performing its obligations. As we reimburse the
Administrator for its expenses, we will indirectly bear such cost. The Administrator engaged Ultimus Fund Solutions, LLC under a sub-administration
agreement to assist the Administrator in performing certain of its administrative duties. The Administrator may enter into additional sub-administration agreements
with third-parties to perform other administrative and professional services on behalf of the Administrator. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We
are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings
that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment
income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can
be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 

Assuming
that the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 were to remain constant and that we took no actions
to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact in millions) of hypothetical base
rate changes in interest rate (considering interest rate floors for floating rate instruments).

The

We
may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject
to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also
limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest
rates. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in our periodic United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC filings
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such
possible controls and procedures. 

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

Neither
we nor our Advisor is currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened
against us, or against our Advisor. 

From
time to time, we, or our Advisor, may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings
relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings
cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition
or results of operations. 

From
time to time we are involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of our business. Our businesses
are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

As
set forth in the table below (dollars in thousands, except per share and share amounts), during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we issued and sold 9,455 shares of common stock at an aggregate offering amount of approximately 50.0 million. The issuance of the shares
of common stock was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 506(b) of Regulation
D thereof and previously reported by us on our current reports on Form 8-K. The Company relied, in part, upon representations from the
investors in the subscription agreements that each investor was an accredited investor as defined in Regulation D under the Securities
Act. We did not engage in general solicitation or advertising, and did not offer securities to the public, in connection with such issuances
and sales.
