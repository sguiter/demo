 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Certain figures, such as interest rates and other percentages included in this section have been rounded for ease of presentation. Percentage figures included in this section have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements or in the associated text. Certain other amounts that appear in this section may similarly not sum due to rounding. As used in the discussion below, we, our, us, and the Company refers to Rezolute, Inc. Rezolute, Inc. Rezolute , the Company , we or us is a late-stage rare disease company focused on significantly improving outcomes for individuals with hypoglycemia caused by hyperinsulinism HI ). Our priority going into the end of 2024 and first half of 2025 is to execute across our two Phase 3 clinical trials. Our goals include (i) complete enrollment of ex-U.S. participants in the sunRIZE study, (ii) progress study start-up activities in the U.S. to enable U.S. participant enrollment in the sunRIZE study, and (iii) advance study start-up activities and begin enrollment for the Phase 3 registrational tumor HI study. Ersodetug for congenital hyperinsulinism (cHI) Congenital HI is the most common cause of recurrent and persistent hypoglycemia in children. Individuals with congenital HI typically present with signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia shortly after birth. Hypoglycemia can result in significant brain injury and death if not recognized and managed appropriately. Additionally, recurrent, or cumulative, hypoglycemia can lead to progressive and irreversible damage over time, including serious and devastating brain injury, seizures, neuro-developmental problems, feeding difficulties, and significant impact on patient and family quality of life. In cases that are unresponsive to medical management, surgical removal of the pancreas may be required. In those with diffuse disease where the whole pancreas is affected, a near-total pancreatectomy can be undertaken, although ongoing medical treatment of hypoglycemia is generally required for several years after surgery, before eventual insulin-dependent diabetes ensues. There are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approved therapies for all forms of congenital HI and the current standard of care treatments are suboptimal. The current treatments used by physicians include glucagon, diazoxide, somatostatin analogues and pancreatectomy. We estimate that in the U.S. alone the immediately addressable market for congenital HI is more than 1,500 individuals. Ersodetug has received Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. and European Union for the treatment of congenital HI, as well as Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in the U.S., a prerequisite for a request for a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher upon Biologics License Application BLA submission. Based on the multinational Phase 2b clinical trial RIZE outcomes and the evidence of benefit in this serious condition with substantial unmet medical need, ersodetug was subsequently granted a priority medicines PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency EMA and an Innovation Passport designation by the UK Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway ILAP Steering Group for the treatment of congenital HI. sunRIZE Phase 3 Study We are actively enrolling a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study (the sunRIZE study) of ersodetug for the treatment of hypoglycemia in participants with congenital HI, an ultra-rare pediatric genetic disorder characterized by excessive production of insulin by the pancreas. If untreated, the elevated insulin levels in patients suffering with congenital HI can induce extreme hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) events, increasing the risk of neurological and developmental complications, including persistent feeding problems, learning disabilities, recurrent seizures, brain damage or even death. The sunRIZE study is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm evaluation of ersodetug in participants 3 months of age and older with congenital HI who are not adequately responding to standard of care medical therapies. Specifically, the study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of ersodetug in participants who are unable to achieve control of low blood sugars hypoglycemia [

 On September 4, 2024, FDA lifted the partial clinical holds on ersodetug. We are currently conducting study start-up activities at sites in the U.S. in anticipation of enrolling U.S. participants in the sunRIZE study in the first part of calendar 2025. Topline results from the study are anticipated to be available in the second half of calendar 2025. Ersodetug for tumor hyperinsulinism (HI) Tumor HI may be caused by two distinct types of tumors: neuroendocrine islet cell tumors ICTs and non-islet cell tumors NICTs ), both of which lead to hypoglycemia due to excessive activation of the insulin receptor. Insulinomas are the most common type of functional ICT and mediate hypoglycemia through excessive insulin production. NICTs are generally associated with relatively large, solid tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma, fibrosarcoma and mesothelioma, and can cause hypoglycemia by producing and secreting insulin-like paraneoplastic substances such as IGF-2 or related variants that bind to and activate the insulin receptor. This form of hypoglycemia can occur in more than 15 different tumor types. Current therapies for insulinomas and NICTs can be grouped into two main categories: (a) tumor-directed de-bulking therapies (e.g. surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy), which may indirectly and/or eventually lead to decreased levels of circulating insulin and/or insulin-like substances, and therefore control HI and related hypoglycemia; and/or (b) medical therapies such as glucocorticoids that are used to attempt to treat the hypoglycemia. Tumor-directed therapies do not directly treat hypoglycemia caused by insulinomas or NICTs. In many cases, tumor-directed therapies are administered concurrently with medical therapies for hypoglycemia and in other cases successful treatment of hypoglycemia often enables the initiation and/or continuation of tumor-directed therapies, as indicated. During the period from diagnosis to surgical treatment, or if surgery is contraindicated or refused, medical treatments are often necessary to directly manage the HI and hypoglycemia induced by the tumor. Additionally, chronic medical management of refractory hypoglycemia is often necessary for patients who cannot be cured by surgery, such as those with extensive disease of the pancreas, multi-focal insulinomas, inoperable or unresectable benign or malignant insulinomas, metastatic insulinomas, non-pancreatic insulinomas, or NICT hypoglycemia resulting from a variety of other tumors. A significant unmet need exists for treatment options with improved efficacy and tolerability as normalization of glucose levels is crucial to prevent serious signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, improve patient quality of life and overall function, and even to ensure patients are fit to receive cancer treatment and to reduce mortality. Unfortunately, some patients are unresponsive to the current standard of care medical therapies for tumor HI and experience debilitating hypoglycemia that is otherwise untreatable. Currently available medical therapies are directed at reducing or eliminating insulin production and/or secretion from tumors, which may be challenging when the tumor is differentiated or dysregulated, and therefore not responding to usual control mechanisms for suppressing insulin production. In some cases, commonly utilized somatostatin analog therapies may even worsen hypoglycemia due to suppression of glucagon. Therefore, currently available medical therapies directed at suppressing insulin production may have limited effectiveness in tumor HI. While we believe the total addressable market may be larger, the immediately addressable market for the combined indications causing tumor HI is estimated to be approximately 1,500 patients in the U.S. alone, including approximately 500 with islet cell tumor hypoglycemia ICTH and approximately 1,000 with non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia NICTH ). On August 5, 2024, we announced FDA clearance of our Investigational New Drug IND application for a Phase 3 registrational study of ersodetug for the treatment of hypoglycemia due to tumor HI. This is the second rare disease program with ersodetug in Phase 3 development. We are initiating start-up activities for the study, which will be primarily conducted in the U.S., and patient enrollment is planned to commence in the first half of calendar 2025. Topline results from the study are anticipated to be available in the second half of calendar 2026. The Phase 3 registrational study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 24 participants who have inadequately controlled hypoglycemia because of tumor HI. Eligible participants will be randomized in 1:1 fashion (12 per treatment arm) to receive ersodetug 9 mg/kg per week or matched placebo, as an add-on to standard of care. Up to 24 additional participants may be enrolled into an open-label arm, in participants whose hypoglycemia is being managed by IV glucose in a hospital setting. Following a 6-week pivotal treatment period, all participants may receive ersodetug in open-label extension. The primary endpoint is the change in Level 2 (moderate) and Level 3 (severe) hypoglycemia events by self-monitored blood glucose. Additional endpoints include overall hypoglycemia events, time in hypoglycemia by continuous glucose monitor, patient reported quality of life, hospitalizations, and change in glucose requirements (for open-label hospitalized participants.

 Expanded Access Program EAP Ersodetug has been shown to counteract excessive insulin action downstream, at the insulin-receptor on target organs. The unique mechanism of action of ersodetug makes the therapy a potential universal treatment for any form of hyperinsulinism. We maintain an EAP for a variety of HI indications for the purpose of making ersodetug available on a compassionate use basis when available therapeutic options have failed, and an individual s hypoglycemia is unmanageable. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we received and approved an EAP request from Dr. Mary Elizabeth Patti, Director of the Hypoglycemia Clinic at the Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Medical Center-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center, for a patient with intractable hypoglycemia caused by a metastatic insulinoma. Dr. Patti received a single patient IND approval from the FDA's Office of Cardiology, Hematology, Endocrinology and Nephrology - Division of Diabetes, Lipid Disorders, and Obesity Division to treat the patient with ersodetug. Dr. Patti reported that the patient safely achieved correction of hypoglycemia with ersodetug, enabling the patient to wean off continuous intravenous dextrose and several other medications for hypoglycemia, leave the hospital after a prolonged stay, and resume receiving concurrent treatment for his cancer with tumor-directed therapies. The patient remained on ersodetug for more than a year until he eventually passed away due to progression of his underlying malignant/metastatic insulinoma. We have received and approved several additional requests to date for use of ersodetug in patients with tumor HI caused by metastatic insulinomas and other insulin secreting metastatic cancer (cervical). In the U.S., these requests have all been approved by the Division. These patients have been refractory to usual standard of care therapies for chronic management of hypoglycemia and required continuous high volume/concentration intravenous dextrose or nutritional infusion and were hospitalized and in life-threatening or hospice-bound condition because of uncontrollable hypoglycemia. Further treatment with tumor-directed therapies (e.g., embolization, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) was often deferred as a result of the debilitating hypoglycemia. Generally, dosing for tumor HI patients has been either 6 mg/kg or 9 mg/kg every 1-2 weeks. In all cases to date, ersodetug has led to substantial improvement in hypoglycemia and has been well tolerated. Within a relatively short period of time after administration of ersodetug, continuous intravenous dextrose was discontinued or substantially reduced and hospitalized patients were able to be discharged and receive maintenance ersodetug doses on an outpatient basis, with durable benefit. In most cases, other background medical therapies for hypoglycemia were able to be weaned or stopped, and patients were able to resume tumor-directed therapies for treatment of their underlying cancer. Patients with metastatic tumor HI often have underlying hepatic injury (abnormal enzymes) at baseline due to hepatic metastases or previous tumor-directed treatments (e.g., partial liver resection or embolization). The patients with hepatic injury that have been treated under the EAP have not exhibited any indication of hepatic toxicity with the use of ersodetug. RZ402 for diabetic macular edema (DME) Our second clinical asset, RZ402, is an oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor PKI and potential therapy for the chronic treatment of diabetic macular edema DME ). DME is a vascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness in the U.S. and elsewhere. Chronic exposure to high blood sugar levels can lead to inflammation, cell damage, and the breakdown of blood vessel walls. Specifically, in DME, retinal blood vessels at the back of the eye become porous and permeable leading to the unwanted infiltration of fluid into the macula. This fluid leakage creates distorted vision, and if left untreated, blindness. In May 2024, we completed a Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel arm study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of RZ402 administered as a monotherapy over a 12-week treatment period in participants with DME who are na ve to, or have received limited anti-VEGF injections. The study met both primary endpoints, demonstrating a significant reduction in central subfield thickness CST") in the study eye at all RZ402 dose levels compared to placebo (up to approximately 50 micron improvement), as well as good safety and tolerability. The program is available for partnering and we are actively engaged in conversations with potential partners to take RZ402 into further development. Recent Developments 2024 Underwritten Offering On June 13, 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement for the planned issuance and sale of equity securities in an underwritten public offering (the 2024 Underwritten Offering ). The 2024 Underwritten Offering provided for the issuance of (i) 11,250,000 shares of common stock at a price of 4.00 per share for gross proceeds of 45.0 million, and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 3,750,000

Table of Contents 
 shares of common stock at a public offering price of 3.999 per pre-funded warrant (the 2024 PFWs for gross proceeds of 15.0 million. The Company granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,250,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of 4.00 per share, less underwriting discounts of 6.0 of the gross proceeds. The underwriters option was partially exercised for 1,786,589 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of 7.1 million. Closing occurred on June 24, 2024, whereby the aggregate gross proceeds amounted to 67.1 million. The net proceeds of the 2024 Underwritten Offering amounted to approximately 62.6 million. In July 2024, we utilized approximately 59.7 million of the net proceeds from the 2024 Underwritten Offering to purchase investments in marketable debt securities with maturities that range from October 2024 through December 2025. 2024 Private Placement In June 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the 2024 SPA with Handok, Inc. and one other investor relating to a private placement (the 2024 Private Placement ), pursuant to which we agreed to sell 1,500,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of 4.00 per share. Closing of the 2024 Private Placement occurred in July 2024, whereby we received proceeds of 6.0 million. Exchange PFW Exercises On July 23, 2024, an investor from our March 2024 Exchange Agreement provided notice of cashless exercise of their Exchange PFWs. We issued 610,273 shares of our common stock on July 24, 2024, and we did not receive any cash proceeds from the exercise. Subsequently, in October 2024, additional holders of Exchange PFWs provided notice of cashless exercise of their PFWs. We issued 2,389,111 shares of our common stock in October 2024 and did not receive any cash proceeds from the exercise. Factors Impacting our Results of Operations We have not generated any meaningful revenues since our inception in March 2010. Over the last several years, we have conducted private placements and public offerings to raise additional capital, adopted a licensing model to pursue development of product candidates, conducted pre-clinical and clinical trials, and conducted other research and development activities on our pipeline of product candidates. Due to the time required to conduct clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we anticipate it will be several years before we generate substantial revenues, if ever. We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future; therefore, we expect to continue efforts to raise additional capital to maintain our current operating plans over the next several years. We cannot assure you that we will secure such financing or that it will be adequate for the long-term execution of our business strategy. Even if we obtain additional financing, it may be costly and may require us to agree to covenants or other provisions that will favor new investors over our existing shareholders. Key Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss Research and development expenses. Research and development R D expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for our personnel engaged in R D activities, clinical trial costs, licensing costs, and consulting and outside services. Our R D compensation costs include an allocable portion of our cash and share-based compensation, employee benefits, and consulting costs related to personnel engaged in the design and development of product candidates and other scientific research projects. We also allocate a portion of our facilities and overhead costs based on the personnel and other resources devoted to R D activities. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative G A expenses consist primarily of (i) an allocable portion of our cash and share-based compensation and employee benefits related to personnel engaged in our administrative, finance, accounting, and executive functions, and (ii) an allocable portion of our facilities and overhead costs related to such personnel. G A expenses also include travel, legal, auditing, consulting, investor relations and other costs primarily related to our status as a public company. Interest and other income. Interest and other income consist primarily of interest income earned on marketable debt securities and temporary cash investments, amortization of investment premiums and accretion of investment discounts, and realized gains on investments in marketable debt securities. Loss from change in fair value of derivative liability. We recognize liabilities for financial instruments that are required to be accounted for as derivatives, as well as embedded derivatives in our debt agreements. Derivative liabilities are adjusted to fair value at the end of

Table of Contents 
 each reporting period until the contracts are settled, expire, or otherwise meet the conditions for equity classification. Changes in fair value are reflected as a gain or loss in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Overview The discussion herein is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. With respect to our significant accounting policies that are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of our 2024 Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Investments in Marketable Debt Securities We account for investments in marketable debt securities as available-for-sale securities whereby they are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Interest income consists of accrued interest earned based on the coupon rate of the security, plus the impact of accreting discounts and amortizing premiums to maturity using the straight-line method which approximates the interest method. Unrealized gains and losses due to subsequent changes in fair value of the investments are reported in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The individual debt securities in our portfolio are subject to credit risk in the event of default by the issuers. We review the components of our portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine if declines in fair value below amortized cost have resulted from a credit-related loss or other factors. To the extent that declines in fair value are due to a deterioration of credit quality of the issuer, we will recognize an allowance for credit losses related to such investments with a corresponding loss in the consolidated statements of operations. Allowances for credit losses may be reversed in subsequent periods if conditions improve and credit-related losses are no longer expected. For a decline in fair value that is solely due to changes in interest rates, impairment is not recognized if we have the ability and intent to hold the investment until maturity. The cost basis of any securities sold prior to maturity will be determined using the specific identification method. Research and Development R D costs are expensed as incurred. Intangible assets related to in-licensing costs under license agreements with third parties are charged to expense unless we are able to determine that the licensing rights have an alternative future use in other R D projects or otherwise. Clinical Trial Accruals Clinical trial costs are a component of R D expenses. We accrue and recognize expenses for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with clinical research organizations and clinical trial sites. We determine the estimates through discussions with internal clinical personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used or rendered in future R D activities are deferred and recognized as expense in the period that the related goods are delivered, or services are performed.

Table of Contents 
 Share-Based Compensation Expense We measure the fair value of services received in exchange for grants of stock options based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We compute the fair value of stock options with time-based vesting using the BSM option-pricing model and recognize the cost of the equity awards over the period that services are provided to earn the award. For awards that contain a graded vesting schedule, and the only condition for vesting is a service condition, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period as if the award was, in substance, a single award. We recognize the impact of forfeitures in the period that the forfeiture occurs, rather than estimating the number of awards that are not expected to vest in accounting for share-based compensation. For stock options that are voluntarily surrendered by employees, all unrecognized compensation is immediately recognized in the period the options are cancelled. Results of Operations Three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenue. As a late-stage rare disease company, we did not generate any revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We are at a late stage of clinical development and do not currently have any commercial products. Our existing product candidates will require extensive additional clinical evaluation, regulatory review, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they generate any revenues. We do not expect to be able to generate revenue from any of our product candidates for several years. Research and development expenses. R D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 

September 30, Increase 2024 2023 Amount Percent Total R D expenses 12,754 12,214 540 4 The increase in R D expenses of 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a net increase of 0.6 million in costs incurred for our two clinical candidate programs, of which the ersodetug program had an increase in spending of 1.9 million and the RZ402 program had a decrease in spending of 1.3 million. This increase was partially offset by a 0.2 million decrease in other preclinical toxicology expenses, and a 0.1 million increase in R D related compensation and benefits. The increase in ersodetug program costs of 1.9 million primarily was driven by an increase of 1.7 million for higher spending on drug substance and drug product manufacturing and process performance qualification batch productions, and a 0.2 million increase in clinical trial costs due to the ongoing enrollment of patients in the congenital HI Phase 3 clinical study. RZ402 program costs decreased by 1.3 million due to a 1.2 million decrease in clinical operation costs related to the Phase 2 study, for which the final patients completed the protocol in April 2024, and a 0.1 million decrease in manufacturing preclinical, toxicology and other related program costs. Compensation and benefits for our R D workforce increased by approximately 0.1 million. Cash-based compensation and benefits increased by approximately 0.2 million due to an increase in performance-related bonus accruals. General and administrative expenses. G A expenses for the three months ended September, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 

September 30, Increase 2024 2023 Amount Percent Total G A expenses 4,187 3,700 487 13 The increase in G A expenses of 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to an increase in consulting expenses of 0.3 million related to business development and an increase of 0.2 million in compensation and benefits for our G A workforce. 

 23 

Table of Contents 
 Cash-based compensation and benefits for our G A workforce increased by approximately 0.5 million and was partially offset by a reduction of share-based compensation of 0.3 million. This 0.5 million increase in cash-based compensation was primarily attributable to an increase in the average number of G A employees from 14 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 18 employees for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Share-based compensation for our G A workforce decreased by 0.3 million from 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease in share-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to stock options that became fully vested during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Interest and other income . Interest and other income amounted to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase of 0.2 million was primarily due to an increase in the average value of money market funds and investments in marketable debt securities from 98.8 million at September 30, 2023 to 107.4 million as of September 30, 2024 as investment maturities were utilized to fund operating activities. Investments in marketable debt securities are our primary source of liquidity to fund clinical expenditures and other operating expenses. Income taxes. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not recognize any income tax benefit due to our net losses, and our determination that a valuation allowance was required for all of our deferred income tax assets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Short-term Liquidity Requirements As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 10.5 million, short-term marketable debt securities of 97.8 million and working capital was approximately 102.2 million. We have incurred cumulative net losses of 344.8 million since our inception and as a clinical stage company we have not generated any meaningful revenue to date. Our most significant contractual obligations consist of milestone payments pursuant to licensing agreements with XOMA Corporation XOMA and ActiveSite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ActiveSite discussed below. Our primary source of liquidity has historically been from the completion of private placements and public offerings of our equity securities, as well as proceeds from the issuance of debt securities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we received proceeds of 6.0 million related to a private placement of 1.5 million shares of common stock. For further information about the key terms and results of our equity financing activities completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for net proceeds of 62.6 million and the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 for net proceeds of 6.0 million, please refer to the discussion above under the caption Recent Developments. The completion of equity financings between May 2022 and September 2024 is the primary source of our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in marketable debt securities of 108.3 million as of September 30, 2024. In April 2022 we entered into a lease agreement for a new corporate headquarters facility in Redwood City, California. This lease, which commenced in October 2022, provides for total base rent payments of approximately 2.9 million through the expected expiration of the lease in July 2027. Additionally, in October 2023 we extended the lease agreement for our office facility in Bend, Oregon. This lease extension provides for additional base rent payment of approximately 0.4 million through the expiration date of the lease in February 2027. Remaining cash payments related to existing contractual obligations for the 12-months ending September 30, 2025 include approximately (i) 0.7 million under all of our operating lease agreements, (ii) a milestone payment to XOMA of 5.0 million due upon dosing of the last patient in any of our Phase 3 clinical trials for ersodetug. Due to uncertainties in the timing associated with clinical trial activities, it is possible that the milestone payment due upon dosing of the last patient could be delayed beyond September 30, 2025. Based on our cash and cash equivalents balance of 10.5 million and investments in short-term marketable debt securities balance of 97.8 million as of September 30, 2024, we believe we have adequate capital resources to meet all of our contractual obligations and conduct all planned activities to advance our clinical trials at least through the next 12 months. Long-term Liquidity Requirements Our most significant long-term contractual obligations consist of additional clinical and regulatory milestone payments up to 30.0 million payable to XOMA and additional milestone payments up to 25.0 million payable to ActiveSite. Of these amounts, we expect

 that 5.0 million will be payable to XOMA during the 12-month period ending September 30, 2025 as discussed above under the caption Short-term Liquidity Requirements. Up to 50.0 million of the remaining milestone payments that may become payable are considered a long-term liquidity requirement. Due to uncertainties in the timing associated with clinical trial activities and regulatory approvals, there is even greater uncertainty in forecasting the timing of future clinical and regulatory milestone payments to XOMA and ActiveSite that may extend beyond the next 12 months. In addition to the clinical and regulatory milestone payments discussed above, upon the future commercialization of ersodetug and RZ402 we will be obligated to pay additional milestone payments and royalties based on the net sales of the related products and alternative indication regulatory approvals to XOMA and ActiveSite for an aggregate up to 202.5 million. These future milestones include 185.0 million in potential payments to XOMA and 17.5 million to ActiveSite for various sales-based milestones and alternative indication regulatory approvals. No assurance can be provided that commercialization will ever be achieved for ersodetug and RZ402, in which case none of these future payments may ever be required. In addition to our licensing obligations, we also have long-term contractual obligations under existing operating lease agreements of 0.8 million for each of the fiscal years ending June 30, 2026 and 2027. Based on our current forecast, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities will be sufficient to fund our long-term contractual obligations and conduct all planned activities to advance our clinical trials at least through the third quarter of calendar year 2025. In November 2023 we entered into the Sales Agreement that provides for an at-the-market offering for the sale of up to 50.0 million in shares of our common stock. The net proceeds under the Sales Agreement, if any, will be used to fund a portion of our long-term liquidity requirements including payments for general corporate purposes and to meet our working capital requirements. To date, we have not elected to sell any shares of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. Even if we elect to sell the entire 50.0 million of shares under the Sales Agreement, we will need to obtain additional equity or debt financing in order to fund all of our long-term liquidity requirements. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain sufficient sources of equity and debt financing on terms that are acceptable to our Board of Directors and stockholders. Presented below is an additional discussion about the ongoing requirements pursuant to our license agreements with XOMA and ActiveSite, along with additional information about our ongoing financing activities that impacted our liquidity and capital resources through September 30, 2024. XOMA License Agreement In December 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the XOMA License Agreement with XOMA through its wholly-owned subsidiary, XOMA (US) LLC, pursuant to which XOMA granted an exclusive global license to develop and commercialize XOMA 358 (formerly X358 or RZ358, now ersodetug) for all indications. In January 2019, the XOMA License Agreement was amended with an updated payment schedule, as well as revised the amount we were required to expend on development of ersodetug and related licensed products, and revised provisions with respect to our diligence efforts in conducting clinical studies. Upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory events, we will be required to make up to 37.0 million in aggregate milestone payments to XOMA. Milestone payments made to date include a 2.0 million payment in January 2022 for the enrollment of the last patient of the Phase 2 clinical study and 5.0 million paid in May 2024 related to the first patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study. We record a liability for milestone payments in our financial statements on the date that we achieve the milestone event. The next milestone payment of 5.0 million will be due upon the enrollment of the last patient in a Phase 3 study, which we believe will occur in the next twelve months. Additionally, upon the future commercialization of ersodetug, we will be required to pay royalties to XOMA based on the net sales of the related products, and milestone payments up to an additional 185.0 million if future annual sales related to ersodetug exceed targets ranging from 100.0 million to 1.0 billion. Through September 30, 2024, no events have occurred that would result in the requirement to make additional milestone payments and no royalties have been incurred. ActiveSite License Agreement In August 2017, we entered into a Development and License Agreement with ActiveSite ActiveSite License Agreement pursuant to which we acquired the rights to ActiveSite s PKI portfolio. We are planning to use the PKI Program to develop, file, manufacture, market and sell products for diabetic macular edema and other therapeutic indications. The ActiveSite License Agreement requires various milestone payments ranging from 1.0 million to 10.0 million when milestone events occur, up to an aggregate of 46.5 million

 of aggregate milestone payments. The first milestone payment for 1.0 million was paid in December 2020 after completion of preclinical work and submission of an IND to the FDA for RZ402. The second milestone payment for 3.0 million became due upon dosing of the first patient in a Phase 2 study in February 2023. Remaining milestone payments under the ActiveSite License Agreement for various clinical and regulatory milestones amount to 25.0 million and milestones after commercial success or alternative indication approvals amount to 17.5 million. We will also be required to pay royalties equal to 2.0 of any sales of products that use the PKI Program. Through September 30, 2024, no events have occurred that would result in the requirement to make additional milestone payments and no royalties have been incurred. Cash Flows Summary Presented below is a summary of our operating, investing, and financing cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (16,014) (10,585) (5,429) Investing activities (49,410) 2,606 (52,016) Financing activities 5,500 5,500 Cash Used in Operating Activities For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash used in operating activities amounted to 16.0 million and 10.6 million, respectively. The key components in the calculation of our cash used in operating activities are as follows (in thousands): 

2024 2023 Change Net loss (15,378) (14,524) (854) Non-cash expenses 1,550 1,995 (445) Accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on marketable debt securities, net (832) 973 (1,805) Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net (1,354) 971 (2,325) Total (16,014) (10,585) (5,429) For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net loss was 15.4 million compared to 14.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For further discussion about changes in our operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, please refer to Results of Operations above. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our non-cash expenses of 1.6 million and 2.0 million, respectively, were primarily attributable to share-based compensation expense, and non-cash lease expense. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, amortization of premiums exceeded accretion of discounts on marketable debt securities by 0.8 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, accretion of discounts exceeded amortization of premiums on marketable debt securities by 1.0 million. Accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on marketable debt securities are a component of interest income that results from investing in marketable debt securities at premiums and discounts. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flow by 1.4 million, primarily driven by a net decrease of 1.3 million in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 0.1 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flow by 1.0 million, primarily driven by a net increase of 1.9 million in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. This amount was partially offset by cash outflows resulting from an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 0.9 million. Cash Provided by or Used in Investing Activities For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash used in investing activities amounted to 49.4 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we received proceeds of 23.8 million upon the maturity of certain marketable debt securities. These cash proceeds from maturities, along with certain proceeds from the 2024 Public Underwritten Offering in June 2024 and 2024 Private Placement in July 2024, were used to purchase a total of 73.2 million of marketable debt securities.

Cash Provided by or Used in Financing Activities For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash provided by financing activities was 5.5 million. Cash inflows amounted to 6.1 million consisting of 6.0 of proceeds from the 2024 Private Placement and proceeds of 0.1 million of proceeds the exercise of employee stock options. These amounts were partially offset by cash outflows related to the payments of offering costs of 0.6 million incurred in connection with the 2024 Public Underwritten Offering. There was no net cash provided by or used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please refer to Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet transactions for the periods covered by this Report. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Not applicable. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our Principal Executive and Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Principal Executive and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Based on that assessment under those criteria, our management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting During the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
