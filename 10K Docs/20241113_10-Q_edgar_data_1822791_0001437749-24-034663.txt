 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

per share Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq under the symbol CLNN. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 We incurred a loss from operations of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively; and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Our accumulated deficit was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, and net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 We have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. We have not generated significant revenues since our inception, and we do not anticipate generating significant revenues unless we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for commercialization of a drug candidate. We expect to incur additional losses in the future, particularly as we advance the development of our clinical-stage drug candidates, continue research and development of our preclinical drug candidates, and initiate additional clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, these and other future drug candidates. We expect that within the next twelve months, we will not have sufficient cash and other resources on hand to sustain our current operations or meet our obligations as they become due unless we obtain additional financing. Additionally, pursuant to our term loan with Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund, L.P. Avenue ), we are required to maintain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least million to avoid acceleration of the full balance of the loan (see Note 8 ). These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 To mitigate our funding needs, we plan to raise additional funding, including exploring equity financing and offerings, debt financing, licensing or collaboration arrangements with third parties, as well as utilizing our existing at-the-market facility, equity purchase agreement, and potential proceeds from the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options. These plans are subject to market conditions and reliance on third parties, and there is no assurance that effective implementation of our plans will result in the necessary funding to continue current operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , we generated million of gross proceeds from our equity distribution agreement (the ATM Agreement and subsequent to September 30, 2024 , we raised million from a registered direct offering of equity securities and an additional million that we received as of September 30, 2024 from separate, concurrent private placements (the Private Placements of equity securities that closed on October 1, 2024. We have implemented cost-saving initiatives, including delaying and reducing certain research and development programs and commercialization efforts and elimination of certain staff positions. We have concluded that our plans do not alleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern beyond one year from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As a result, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and their carrying amounts, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split of our Common Stock. Beginning with the opening of trading on the Effective Date, our Common Stock began trading on Nasdaq on a split-adjusted basis under the same symbol, CLNN. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding were automatically combined and converted into 1 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares, stockholders received an amount in cash (without interest) equal to: (i) the number of shares of Common Stock held by such stockholder before the Reverse Stock Split that would otherwise have been exchanged for such fractional shares multiplied by (ii) the closing price of our Common Stock on Nasdaq on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Date. The Reverse Stock Split did not reduce the total number of authorized shares of Common Stock or preferred stock, par value per share Preferred Stock ), or change the par values of the Company s Common Stock or Preferred Stock. All outstanding stock options, warrants, rights to restricted stock awards, convertible debt, and contingent earn-out shares entitling their holders to purchase or receive shares of Common Stock were adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, in accordance with the terms of each such security. In addition, the number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to our Amended 2020 Stock Plan was also appropriately adjusted. All historical share and per share data for the periods presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements, including for periods ending prior to July 11, 2024, has been adjusted to reflect the 1 -for- Reverse Stock Split on a retroactive basis as if the Reverse Stock Split occurred as of the earliest period presented. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, approximately of par value was reclassified from Common Stock to Additional Paid-In Capital.

 to years for laboratory equipment, to years for furniture and fixtures, and to years for computer software. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets. Costs for capital assets not yet placed into service are capitalized as construction-in-progress and depreciated or amortized in accordance with the above useful lives once placed into service. Upon retirement or sale, the related cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed to operations as incurred. 
 We capitalize costs to obtain or develop computer software for internal use, including development costs incurred during the software development stage and costs to obtain software for access and conversion of historical data. We also capitalize costs to modify, upgrade, or enhance existing internal-use software that result in additional functionality. We expense costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, training costs, data conversion costs, and maintenance costs. 

Leases may contain clauses for renewal at our option. Payments to be made in option periods are recognized as part of the right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that the option to extend the lease will be exercised, or is not at our option. We determine whether the reasonably certain threshold is met by considering contract-, asset-, market-, and entity-based factors. Operating lease expense, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and the amortization of finance lease right-of-use assets, which are included in property and equipment and depreciated, are included in research and development or general and administrative expenses consistent with the leased assets primary use. Accretion on the liabilities for finance leases is included in interest expense.

If Milestone 1 is not achieved but Milestone 2 is achieved, the Clene Nanomedicine stockholders will receive additional shares equal to Milestone 1. Tottenham s former officers, directors, sponsor, and public stockholders (the Initial Stockholders are entitled to receive earn-out shares (the Initial Stockholders Contingent Earn-out, and collectively with the Clene Nanomedicine Contingent Earn-out, the Contingent Earn-outs as follows: (i) shares upon the achievement of Milestone 1; and (ii) shares upon achievement of Milestone 2. If Milestone 1 is not achieved but Milestone 2 is achieved, the Initial Stockholders will receive additional shares equal to Milestone 1. In accordance with ASC 815, the Contingent Earn-outs are not indexed to our own stock and therefore were accounted for as a liability at the Reverse Recapitalization date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with changes recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.

 In October 2023 we were awarded a grant the NIH Grant in collaboration with Columbia University, the prime awardee, and Synapticure, a neurology specialty health clinic, from the National Institute of Health NIH ). The NIH Grant was awarded pursuant to the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act to support up to a four -year Expanded Access Program (the ACT-EAP for CNM- Au8 treatment of ALS. The NIH Grant totaled million and subawards to us may total up to million in aggregate and may extend to August 31, 2027. These subawards are awarded annually and subaward funds are paid to us as reimbursement for cash spent by us to support the ACT-EAP. The first subaward was granted on April 9, 2024 for million for the period from September 25, 2023 to August 31, 2024, of which we have received reimbursements totaling million for expenses incurred plus prepayments of certain ACT-EAP expenses and have incurred an additional million of expenses as of September 30, 2024 for which we expect to receive reimbursement. We are currently in discussions with Columbia University regarding the subaward for the second year of the NIH Grant.

Maryland Loans 
 
 In February 2019, we entered into a term loan agreement (the 2019 MD Loan with the Department of Housing and Community Development DHCD ), a principal department of the State of Maryland, for million bearing simple interest at an annual rate of . We are subject to covenants until maturity, including limitations on our ability to retire, repurchase, or redeem our stock, options, and warrants other than per the terms of the securities; and limitations on our ability to pay dividends. We are not in violation of any covenants. The 2019 MD Loan established Phantom Shares based on shares of Common Stock.

Following the interest-only period, from July 2024 to September 2024, we made equal monthly principal installments of million plus interest at the variable rate then in effect. On September 30, 2024, we entered into an amendment (the Third Amendment which (i) reduced the October 2024 principal installment from million to million, plus interest at the applicable variable rate, (ii) reduced the November 2024 and December 2024 principal installments from million to million each, plus interest at the applicable variable rate, and (iii) delayed the maturity date of the loan from December 1, 2024 to April 1, 2025, with four consecutive monthly principal installments of approximately million due from January 2025 to April 2025.

The Third Amendment also provides for a contingent extension of the maturity date and repayment period if, on or before December 31, 2024, we receive reasonably satisfactory evidence that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA does not object to our submission of a new drug application NDA seeking accelerated approval for CNM- Au8 as a potential treatment for ALS and we have submitted such NDA for review (the ALS NDA Milestone ). If we achieve the ALS NDA Milestone, the January 2025 and February 2025 principal installments shall be reduced to million each, followed by four equal consecutive monthly principal installments in an amount sufficient to fully amortize the loan, plus interest at the applicable variable rate, with a maturity date of June 1, 2025.

We are not in violation of any covenants. Avenue has the ability to immediately accelerate all obligations under the 2021 Avenue Loan upon the occurrence of certain events of default or material adverse effects.

In the event of a change of control of the Company, the 2023 Avenue Warrant shall be automatically exchanged for the number of shares of Common Stock which remain exercisable thereunder immediately prior to the change of control transaction, for no payment or consideration from Avenue for such shares, and the 2023 Avenue Warrant shall be terminated. At issuance, the 2023 Avenue Warrant was recorded as a liability and debt discount in amount equal to its fair value of million. The Second Amendment, including the revised terms, cancellation of the 2021 Avenue Warrant, and issuance of the 2023 Avenue Warrant was accounted for as a debt modification. Additionally, pursuant to the Third Amendment, the exercise price of the 2023 Avenue Warrant was reduced from per share to per share, with the resulting change in fair value of million recorded as a debt discount. The Third Amendment was accounted for as a debt modification that also met the requirements as a troubled debt restructuring under ASC 470, Debt ASC 470 ), with no restructuring gain required to be recognized as the future cash payments under the 2021 Avenue Loan, as amended, were greater than its carrying amount.

Pursuant to the grant agreements, if we make future commercial sales of CNM- Au8 for the treatment of MS, we will repay: (i) of the grants upon the first commercial product sale, (ii) an additional of the grants upon cumulative sales of million, (iii) an additional of the grants upon cumulative sales of million, and (iv) an additional of the grants upon cumulative sales of million, with the maximum repayment equal to of the grants if all milestones are achieved. If NMSS has not yet received repayments equal in the aggregate to of the 2019 Grant or of the 2023 Grant, then upon the closing of any of the following events we will repay of the 2019 Grant, equal to million, or of the 2023 Grant, equal to million, less any amounts previously paid by us: (i) sale of all or substantially all of our assets and business, (ii) a public offering that occurs more than twelve months after completion of the applicable research, (iii) sale of any portion of our assets and business including CNM- Au8 for the treatment of MS, (iv) exclusive licensing of our intellectual property claiming CNM- Au8 for the treatment of MS, (v) a collaboration with a third -party to develop CNM- Au8 for the treatment of MS (for the 2019 Grant only), or (vi) licensing of our commercialization rights to CNM- Au8 for the treatment of MS (for the 2023 Grant only). As of September 30, 2024 , we have not met any of the above milestones and the applicable research has not been completed. We accounted for these contingencies in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies . Management has assessed the likelihood of each contingent event as less than probable and therefore no contingent liability is recognized. Management s estimate of the possible range of loss is between the minimum and maximum repayment amounts, equal to and of each grant, or approximately million and million for the 2019 Grant, respectively; and approximately million and million for the 2023 Grant, respectively. However, it is at least reasonably possible that Management s estimate of the likelihood of each contingent event and the possible range of loss will change in the near term.

We may sell shares in excess of a Regular Purchase (an Accelerated Purchase on any day on which we have directed Lincoln Park to purchase the maximum amount allowed for such Regular Purchase, up to the lesser of (i) of the number of shares purchased pursuant to such prior business day Regular Purchase or (ii) of the aggregate shares of our Common Stock traded on Nasdaq on the trading day immediately following the purchase date for such Regular Purchase (subject to certain volume and market price limitations). Additionally, we may sell shares in excess of an Accelerated Purchase (an Additional Accelerated Purchase on any day on which we have directed Lincoln Park to purchase the maximum amount allowed for such Accelerated Purchase, up to the lesser of (i) of the number of shares purchased pursuant to such prior business day Regular Purchase or (ii) of the aggregate shares of our Common Stock traded on Nasdaq during a certain period on the date of the Additional Accelerated Purchase (subject to certain volume and market price limitations). The purchase price for Accelerated Purchases and Additional Accelerated Purchases is equal to of the lesser of (i) the VWAP of our Common Stock on Nasdaq during certain periods on the date of the Accelerated Purchase or Additional Accelerated Purchase or (ii) the closing price of our Common Stock on the date of the Accelerate Purchase or Additional Accelerated Purchase. 
 
 On the date of the Purchase Agreement, we issued shares of Common Stock (the Initial Commitment Shares to Lincoln Park as an initial fee for its commitment under the Purchase Agreement. We recorded the fair value of the Initial Commitment Shares on the date of issuance in other income (expense), net. We may further issue up to additional shares of Common Stock (the Additional Commitment Shares, and, together with the Initial Commitment Shares, the Commitment Shares on a pro rata basis upon each purchase by Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement. Under applicable Nasdaq listing rules, the total number of shares of Common Stock that we may sell to Lincoln Park is limited to shares (including the Commitment Shares), representing of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock immediately prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement, unless we (i) first obtain stockholder approval in accordance with applicable Nasdaq listing rules or (ii) the average price paid by Lincoln Park for all shares of Common Stock issued by us under the Purchase Agreement is equal to or greater than . The Purchase Agreement prohibits us from directing Lincoln Park to purchase any shares of Common Stock that would result in Lincoln Park having beneficial ownership of greater than of our outstanding Common Stock, which Lincoln Park may, in its sole discretion, increase up to of our outstanding Common Stock by delivering written notice thereof to us, which shall not be effective until the 61st day after such written notice is delivered to us. We may terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time, for any reason and without any payment or liability to us, by giving Lincoln Park a termination notice with effect one business date after the notice has been received by Lincoln Park. 
 
 We evaluated the Purchase Agreement under ASC 815 - 40 Derivatives and Hedging Contracts on an Entity's Own Equity as it represents the right to require Lincoln Park to purchase shares of Common Stock in the future, similar to a put option. We concluded it represents a freestanding derivative instrument that does not qualify for equity classification and therefore requires fair value accounting. We analyzed the terms of the contract and concluded the derivative instrument has no value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we sold shares of Common Stock under the Purchase Agreement, issued Additional Commitment Shares, and generated proceeds of million. We did not effect any sales during any of the other periods presented herein.

 Business Overview 
 
 We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel clean-surfaced nanotechnology CSN therapeutics. CSN therapeutics are comprised of atoms of transition elements that, when assembled in nanocrystal form, possess unusually high, unique catalytic activities not present in those same elements in bulk form. These catalytic activities drive, support, and maintain beneficial metabolic and energetic cellular reactions within diseased, stressed, and damaged cells. 
 
 Our patent-protected, proprietary position affords us the potential to develop a broad and deep pipeline of novel CSN therapeutics to address a range of diseases with high impact on human health. We innovated an electro-crystal-chemistry drug development platform that draws from advances in nanotechnology, plasma and quantum physics, material science, and biochemistry. Our platform process results in nanocrystals with faceted structures and surfaces that are free of the chemical surface modifications that accompany other production methods. Many traditional methods of nanoparticle synthesis involve the unavoidable deposition of potentially toxic organic residues and stabilizing surfactants on the particle surfaces. Synthesizing stable nanocrystals that are both nontoxic and highly catalytic has overcome this significant hurdle in harnessing transition metal catalytic activity for therapeutic use. Our clean-surfaced nanocrystals exhibit catalytic activities many-fold higher than multiple other commercially available nanoparticles, produced using various techniques, that we have comparatively evaluated. 
 
 We have multiple drug assets currently in development and/or clinical trials for applications primarily in neurology. Our development and clinical efforts are currently focused on addressing the high unmet medical needs in central nervous system disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS ), multiple sclerosis MS ), and Parkinson s disease PD ). We currently have no drugs approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from drug sales. We have never been profitable and have incurred operating losses in each year since inception. We generate revenue from sales of dietary supplements through our wholly owned subsidiary, dOrbital, Inc., or through an exclusive license with 4Life Research LLC 4Life ), an international supplier of health supplements, stockholder, and related party. We anticipate these revenues to be small compared to our operating expenses and to the revenue we expect to generate from potential future sales of our drug candidates, for which we are currently conducting clinical trials. 
 
 Reverse Recapitalization 
 
 Clene Nanomedicine, Inc. Clene Nanomedicine became a public company on December 30, 2020 (the Closing Date when it completed a reverse recapitalization (the Reverse Recapitalization with Tottenham Acquisition I Limited Tottenham ), and with Tottenham s wholly-owned subsidiary and our predecessor, Chelsea Worldwide Inc., and Creative Worldwide Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chelsea Worldwide Inc. On the Closing Date, Chelsea Worldwide Inc. changed its name to Clene Inc. and listed its shares of common stock, par value 0.0001 per share Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq under the symbol CLNN. 
 
 In connection with the Reverse Recapitalization, certain of Clene Nanomedicine s common stockholders are entitled to receive earn-out payments (the Clene Nanomedicine Contingent Earn-out ), and Tottenham s former officers and directors and Norwich Investment Limited (collectively, the Initial Stockholders are entitled to receive earn-out payments (the Initial Stockholders Contingent Earn-out, and both collectively the Contingent Earn-outs based on achieving certain milestones.

Reverse Stock Split 
 
 Effective July 11, 2024 (the Effective Date ), we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split of our Common Stock. Beginning with the opening of trading on the Effective Date, our Common Stock began trading on Nasdaq on a split-adjusted basis under the same symbol, CLNN. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 20 shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding were automatically combined and converted into 1 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares, stockholders received an amount in cash (without interest) equal to: (i) the number of shares of Common Stock held by such stockholder before the Reverse Stock Split that would otherwise have been exchanged for such fractional shares multiplied by (ii) the closing price of our Common Stock on Nasdaq on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Date. 
 
 The Reverse Stock Split did not reduce the total number of authorized shares of Common Stock or preferred stock, par value 0.0001 per share Preferred Stock ), or change the par values of the Company s Common Stock or Preferred Stock. All outstanding stock options, warrants, rights to restricted stock awards, convertible debt, and contingent earn-out shares entitling their holders to purchase or receive shares of Common Stock were adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, in accordance with the terms of each such security. In addition, the number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to our Amended 2020 Stock Plan was also appropriately adjusted. All historical share and per share data for the periods presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements, including for periods ending prior to July 11, 2024, has been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-20 Reverse Stock Split on a retroactive basis as if the Reverse Stock Split occurred as of the earliest period presented. 
 
 Recent Developments of Our Clinical Programs 
 
 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
 
 On November 1, 2024, we met with the FDA in a Type C meeting that we previously announced on September 16, 2024 and are awaiting minutes from that meeting. We are also planning to execute an international confirmatory Phase 3 trial of CNM-Au8 30 mg, RESTORE-ALS, and expect to initiate the trial in the second quarter of 2025, contingent upon the outcome of the Type C meeting and funding. We announced the following planned design of RESTORE-ALS at the 2024 Annual Northeast ALS Consortium NEALS Meeting on October 23, 2024: 

Objective : to investigate the effects of CNM-Au8 on survival and delayed clinical worsening events in ALS. 

Participant criteria : ALS diagnosis per Gold Coast criteria; symptom onset within 36 months of the screening visit; 60 predicted vital capacity; TRICALS risk score of -2.5 to -6.5; screening biofluid (plasma) neurofilament light 45 pg/mL; stable background treatment (e.g. riluzone, edaravone, both). 

Locations : North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia/Pacific. 

Enrollment : approximately 561 randomized participants, 2:1 treatment allocation with approximately n = 374 active CNM-Au8 30 mg and n = 187 placebo. 

Duration : double-blind treatment period until 190 events accrue, with open-label extension continued until study is terminated or study drug is approved. 

Primary endpoint : delayed time to death (all-cause mortality); assumed hazard ratio of 0.625; one-sided alpha of 

Secondary endpoints : (i) time to death or death equivalent PAV ), (ii) composite ALS clinical worsening hierarchy, (iii) joint-rank of time to death or PAV and ALSSQOL-SF change to week 72, (iv) joint-rank of time to death or PAV and ALSFRS-R change to week 72, (v) joint-rank of time to death or PAV and ROADs change to week 72, (vi) joint-rank of time to death or PAV and SVC percent change to week 72. 

Statistical model : covariate adjusted cox proportional hazard. 

We plan to continue working closely with regulatory health authorities from the FDA, European Medicines Agency, ALS experts, and patient representatives to determine the proper path to support potential approval.

Multiple Sclerosis 
 
 We have initiated a second dosing cohort of REPAIR-MS, an open-label, investigator blinded Phase 2 clinical trial in non-active progressive MS patients. We anticipate enrollment concluding by the end of 2024 with topline results available by mid-2025. We plan to work closely with regulatory health authorities from the FDA and EMA, MS experts, and patient representatives to determine the proper path to advance CNM-Au8 into Phase 3 and potential future approval. We expect to meet with the FDA in an end of Phase 2 meeting in the first half of 2025. 
 
 The chart below reflects the growing body of evidence for CSN therapeutics from our completed and ongoing clinical programs. 

Recent Competition Update 

Despite the great need for an effective disease-modifying treatment for ALS and significant research efforts by the pharmaceutical industry to meet this need, there have been limited clinical successes and no curative therapies approved to date. In April 2023, the FDA granted accelerated approval to tofersen, branded as Qalsody, a drug from Biogen Inc. for the treatment of SOD1-ALS, a rare genetic form of ALS. In May 2024, the European Commission granted marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances for Qalsody in the European Union. Additionally, sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol, a drug from Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. which previously received approval from the FDA and conditional approval from Health Canada based on the results of a Phase 2 trial, was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in the U.S. and Canada following the negative outcome of a Phase 3 clinical trial.

Financial Overview 
 
 Our financial condition, results of operations, and the period-to-period comparability of our financial results are principally affected by the following factors: 
 
 Research and Development Expense 
 
 The discovery and development of novel drug candidates require a significant investment of resources over a prolonged period of time, and a core part of our strategy is to continue making sustained investments in this area. As a result of this commitment, our pipeline of drug candidates has been advancing, with substantially all our research and development expenses relating to CNM-Au8, our lead asset, with the remainder spent on our CNM-ZnAg asset. 
 
 Our research and development expenses are affected by the scope and advancement of our existing product pipeline and the commencement of new drug programs. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages, primarily due to costs and fees for per patient clinical trial sites for larger clinical trials, opening and monitoring clinical sites, contract research organization CRO activity, and manufacturing. We anticipate that our research and development expenses will decrease throughout 2024 as we complete our Phase 2 clinical trials and will increase in future years if and when we advance our assets into Phase 3. Additionally, if we are able to file an NDA with the FDA under an accelerated approval pathway or subsequent to future Phase 3 clinical development activities, if any, we anticipate that our research and development expenses related to regulatory activities would increase in advance of receiving regulatory approval. 
 
 Research and development costs consist primarily of payroll and personnel expenses for salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation; supplies and materials expenses to support our clinical trials; payments to CROs, principal investigators, and clinical trial sites; costs of preclinical activities; consulting costs; and allocated overhead costs, including rent, equipment, utilities, depreciation, insurance, and facilities maintenance. Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred, and nonrefundable advance payments related to future research and development activities are initially recorded as assets and are expensed when we receive the related goods or services. 
 
 Our clinical trial accrual process seeks to account for expenses resulting from obligations under contracts with CROs, consultants, and clinical sites in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts vary and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. We reflect the appropriate clinical trial expenses in the condensed consolidated financial statements by matching the appropriate expenses with the period in which services are performed. In the event advance payments are made to CROs, the payments are recorded as prepaid assets and expensed over the period in which services are performed. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and personnel expenses for salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation; fees for legal, accounting, tax, and information technology services; fees for directors and officers insurance; expenses for business development activities and investor and public relations; rent, utilities, and facility costs; travel costs; and consulting fees. 
 
 We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses in future periods will be contingent upon our discussions with the FDA. If we are able to file an NDA with the FDA under an accelerated pathway, we anticipate our general and administrative expenses would increase in future periods to support increases in our drug development activities and as we build our commercial capabilities in advance of receiving regulatory approval. This potential increase will likely include increased headcount, increased stock compensation expenses, expanded infrastructure including certain sales and marketing activities performed ahead of regulatory approval, and increased insurance expenses. If we are unable to file an NDA with the FDA under an accelerated pathway, we would need to continue investing in clinical research activities and we anticipate our general and administrative expenses would decrease in future periods as we decrease commercial expansion projects, including at our Elkton, Maryland facility, and as we implement cost-saving initiatives, such as a reduction in compensation, a hiring freeze, and elimination of certain staff positions.

Not meaningful. 

The change in research and development expenses was primarily due to the following: 

(i) 
 a decrease in expenses related to our lead drug candidate, CNM-Au8, primarily due to: (i) reimbursements for expenses incurred during the period from September 25, 2023 to August 31, 2024 for our ongoing ALS expanded access program EAP funded by a National Institute of Health grant (the ACT-EAP which were received during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and recorded as an offset to research and development expense, (ii) a decrease in expenses in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, RESCUE-ALS, REPAIR-MS, and VISIONARY-MS clinical trials due to the previous completion of the blinded period of each trial, (iii) a decrease in expenses for the VISIONARY-MS LTE due to its completion, and (iv) a decrease in non-clinical and pre-clinical activities; partially offset by an increase in expenses related to: (A) our two ALS EAPs with Massachusetts General Hospital due to increased enrollment and expansion of one EAP, (B) our REPAIR-MS EAP, (C) planning activities for our RESTORE-ALS clinical trial, and (D) increased regulatory activities; 

(ii) 
 a decrease in expenses related to CNM-ZnAg, primarily due to completion of the clinical trial for treatment of COVID-19 in late 2022 with expenses continuing through 2023; 

(iii) 
 a decrease in unallocated expenses, primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to research, manufacturing, equipment, materials, facilities, and depreciation. 

(iv) 
 an increase in personnel expenses, primarily due to an increase in compensation expense related to the ACT-EAP and our regulatory activities; and 

(v) 
 a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, primarily due to the timing of award grants, vesting, and forfeitures for research and development personnel.

Not meaningful. 

The change in total other income (expense), net, was primarily due to the following: 

(i) 
 a decrease in interest income primarily due to lower average balances of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in 2024; 

(ii) 
 a decrease in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to declining balances of notes payable following principal repayments and a decrease in non-cash interest expense on notes payable, partially offset by increased amortization of debt discounts and issuances costs on notes payable; and an increase in interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to increasing variable interest rates on our notes payable and increased amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs on notes payable, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash interest expense on notes payable; 

(iii) 
 commitment share expense, due to the shares of Common Stock issued to Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC Lincoln Park ), as an initial fee for Lincoln Park s commitment to purchase shares of Common Stock under a purchase agreement with the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; 

(iv) 
 issuance costs from a public equity offering allocated to liability-classified warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; 

(v) 
 a loss on initial issuance of equity from the fair value in excess of proceeds from a public equity offering during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; 

(vi) 
 a gain from a change in fair value of the common stock warrant liability due to the 2023 Avenue Warrant and Tranche A Warrants during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The changes in fair value were due to the change in price of our Common Stock on Nasdaq and updates in the valuation model assumptions (see Critical Accounting Estimates 

(vii) 
 a gain from a change in fair value of the Clene Nanomedicine Contingent Earn-out liability and Initial Stockholders Contingent Earn-out liability during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The changes were due to the price of our Common Stock on Nasdaq and updates in the valuation model assumptions (see Critical Accounting Estimates and 

(viii) 
 a decrease in research and development tax credits and unrestricted grants due to changes in the amount of qualifying research and development expenses incurred.

Taxation 
 
 United States 
 
 We are incorporated in the state of Delaware and subject to statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax at a rate of 21.00 . We are also subject to state income tax in Maryland at a rate of 8.25 , and in Utah at a rate of 4.55 and 4.65 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty as to whether such assets will be realized resulting from our three-year cumulative loss position and the uncertainty surrounding our ability to generate pre-tax income in the foreseeable future. 
 
 Australia 
 
 Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Clene Australia Pty Ltd Clene Australia ), was established in Australia in March 2018 and is subject to corporate income tax at a rate of 30.00 . Clene Australia had no taxable income or provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We recorded other income of 0.1 million and 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for research and development tax credits pertaining to Clene Australia for the 2024 and 2023 tax years, respectively. 
 
 Netherlands 
 
 Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Clene Netherlands B.V. Clene Netherlands ), was established in the Netherlands in April 2021 and is subject to corporate income tax at a rate of 19.00 up to 200,000 of taxable income and 25.80 for taxable income in excess of 200,000. Clene Netherlands had no taxable income or provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources of Capital 
 
 We have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. We expect to incur additional losses in the future to fund our operations and conduct research and development of our drug candidates. We recognize the need to raise additional capital to fully implement our business plan. The long-term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from our products to offset expenses and capital expenditures. In the event that we do not generate sufficient revenues and are unable to obtain funding, we will be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, product portfolio expansion, commercialization efforts, or capital expenditures, which could adversely affect our business prospects, ability to meet long-term liquidity needs, or we may be unable to continue operations. 
 
 Since our inception, we have dedicated substantially all our resources to the development of our drug candidates. We have financed our operations principally through the following sources: 

gross proceeds of 177.2 million from equity financing, including sales of common stock, preferred stock, warrants to purchase common stock; 

gross proceeds of 32.3 million from borrowings under convertible promissory notes; 

gross proceeds of 27.3 million from borrowings under notes payable and convertible notes payable; 

gross proceeds of 9.4 million from the Reverse Recapitalization; 

gross proceeds of 10.1 million from refundable research and development tax credits; 

gross proceeds of 7.6 million from grants from various organizations; and 

gross proceeds of 1.1 million from stock option and warrant exercises.

We also received indirect financial support for the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, administered by Massachusetts General Hospital, which conducted a platform trial for the treatment of ALS with certain drug candidates, including CNM-Au8, at significantly lower costs than we would have otherwise incurred if we had conducted a comparably designed clinical trial at reasonable market rates. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 We incurred a loss from operations of 7.8 million and 9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and 24.4 million and 30.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our accumulated deficit was 268.6 million and 242.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled 14.6 million and 35.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities was 16.5 million and 23.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 We have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. We have not generated significant revenues since our inception, and we do not anticipate generating significant revenues unless we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for commercialization of a drug candidate. We expect to incur additional losses in the future, particularly as we advance the development of our clinical-stage drug candidates, continue research and development of our preclinical drug candidates, and initiate additional clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, these and other future drug candidates. We expect that within the next twelve months, we will not have sufficient cash and other resources on hand to sustain our current operations or meet our obligations as they become due unless we obtain additional financing. Additionally, pursuant to our term loan with Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund, L.P. Avenue ), we are required to maintain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least 5.0 million to avoid acceleration of the full balance of the loan (see Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 To mitigate our funding needs, we plan to raise additional funding, including exploring equity financing and offerings, debt financing, licensing or collaboration arrangements with third parties, as well as utilizing our existing at-the-market facility and equity purchase agreement and potential proceeds from the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options. These plans are subject to market conditions and reliance on third parties, and there is no assurance that effective implementation of our plans will result in the necessary funding to continue current operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 2.1 million of gross proceeds from our equity distribution agreement (the ATM Agreement and subsequent to September 30, 2024, we raised 3.5 million from a registered direct offering of equity securities and an additional 3.8 million that we received as of September 30, 2024 from separate, concurrent private placements of equity securities that closed on October 1, 2024. We have implemented cost-saving initiatives, including delaying and reducing certain research and development programs and commercialization efforts and elimination of certain staff positions. We have concluded that our plans do not alleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern beyond one year from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 
 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As a result, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and their carrying amounts, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Short-Term Material Cash Requirements 
 
 For at least the next twelve months, our primary capital requirements are to fund our operations, including research and development, personnel, regulatory, and other clinical trial costs related to development of our lead drug candidate, CNM-Au8; and general and administrative costs to support our drug development and pre-commercial activities in advance of receiving regulatory approval for our drug candidates. Firm commitments for funds include approximately 1.1 million of payments under operating lease obligations; payment of principal and interest on notes payable totaling 11.0 million; and commitments under various agreements for capital expenditures totaling 0.2 million related to the construction of our manufacturing facilities. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily through cash on hand. Additional sources of funds include equity financing, debt financing, or other capital sources. 
 
 We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical trials and with vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes, which are cancelable at any time by us, subject to payment of our remaining obligations under binding purchase orders and, in certain cases, nominal early termination fees. These commitments are not deemed significant.

Long-Term Material Cash Requirements 
 
 Beyond the next twelve months, our primary capital requirements are to fund our operations, including research and development, personnel, regulatory, and other clinical trial costs related to development of our lead drug candidate, CNM-Au8; and general and administrative costs to support our drug development activities in advance of receiving regulatory approval for our drug candidates. Additional funds may be spent to initiate new clinical trials, at our discretion. Known obligations beyond the next twelve months include 5.5 million of payments under operating lease obligations, and interest and principal repayment of notes payable of 7.7 million. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements primarily through equity financing, debt financing, or other capital sources.

 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted from a net loss of 25.9 million, adjusted for non-cash items totaling 7.8 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of 1.6 million. Significant non-cash items included: (i) depreciation expense of 1.2 million for laboratory and office equipment and leasehold improvements; (ii) non-cash lease expense of 0.4 million; (iii) stock-based compensation expense of 6.2 million; (iv) accretion of debt discount of 1.2 million; (v) non-cash interest expense of 40,000; (vi) non-cash interest income on marketable securities of 0.2 million; (vii) a change in fair value of common stock warrant liabilities of 1.0 million due to changes in the price of our Common Stock on Nasdaq and changes in valuation model inputs; and (viii) a change in fair value of the Clene Nanomedicine and Initial Stockholders Contingent Earn-outs of 0.1 million and 10,000, respectively, due to changes in the price of our Common Stock on Nasdaq and changes in valuation model inputs. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to: (a) a decrease in accounts receivable of 0.1 million and an increase in accounts payable of 0.2 million due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments; (b) an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 1.2 million due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments, the timing of receipt of metals to be used in research and development, and an increase in prepaid ACT-EAP expenses, partially offset by a decrease in research and development tax credits receivable; (c) an increase in accrued liabilities of 2.9 million primarily due to increased accrued compensation and benefits, increased deferred grants, and an increase in accrued CRO and clinical fees; and (d) a decrease in operating lease obligations of 0.4 million. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 23.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which resulted from a net loss of 39.3 million, adjusted for non-cash items totaling 17.0 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of 0.7 million. Significant non-cash items included: (i) depreciation expense of 1.3 million for laboratory and office equipment and leasehold improvements; (ii) non-cash lease expense of 0.3 million; (iii) commitment share expense of 0.4 million for shares of Common Stock issued to Lincoln Park as an initial fee for their commitment to purchase shares of our Common Stock under a purchase agreement; (iv) issuance costs of 0.3 million for liability-classified warrants issued in a public equity offering; (v) a loss on initial issuance of equity of 14.8 million from the fair value in excess of proceeds from a public equity offering; (vi) stock-based compensation expense of 7.1 million; (vii) accretion of debt discount of 0.8 million; (viii) non-cash interest expense of 0.3 million; (ix) a change in fair value of the Clene Nanomedicine and Initial Stockholders Contingent Earn-outs of 2.1 million and 0.3 million, respectively, due to the decrease in price of our Common Stock on Nasdaq and changes in valuation model inputs; and (x) a change in fair value of common stock warrant liabilities of 6.0 million due to the increase in price of our Common Stock on Nasdaq and changes in valuation model inputs. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to: (a) a decrease in accounts receivable of 0.1 million and a decrease in accounts payable of 1.1 million due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments; (b) an increase in inventory of 0.1 million; (c) a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 1.5 million due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments, the timing of receipt of metals to be used in research and development, and a decrease in research and development tax credits receivable; (d) a decrease in accrued liabilities of 0.7 million primarily due to decreased accrued compensation and benefits and CRO and clinical fees; and (e) a decrease in operating lease obligations of 0.4 million.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs, and expenses. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, and our actual results may differ from these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, contractual milestones, and other various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
 
 We consider the following estimates to be critical as they involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Convertible Notes 
 
 In accordance with ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity , we classified a portion of the 2021 Avenue Loan as convertible notes payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and did not separate the conversion option from the host contract as it did not meet the requirements for accounting as a derivative instrument. As of September 30, 2024, the conversion option has expired. We accounted for the convertible note as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as December 31, 2023 with a carrying value of 4.9 million. 
 
 We classified the 2022 DHCD Loan as convertible notes payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and did not separate the conversion option from the host contract as it did not meet the requirements for accounting as a derivative instrument. We account for the convertible note as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the convertible note was carried at 5.3 million and 5.3 million, respectively. 
 
 Common Stock Warrant Liabilities 
 
 Pursuant to amendments to the 2021 Avenue Loan in June 2023 and September 2024, we issued a warrant to purchase 150,000 shares of Common Stock at 4.6014 per share (the 2023 Avenue Warrant ). In accordance with ASC 815, we recognized the 2023 Avenue Warrant as a derivative liability measured at fair value and remeasure the 2023 Avenue Warrant at each reporting date and record the change in fair value as a component of other income (expense), net, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The change in fair value of the 2023 Avenue Warrant resulted in a gain of 0.1 million and a gain of 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and a gain of 39,000 and a gain of 0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We estimate the fair value using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with probability weights for the occurrence of the following events: (i) settlement of the instrument upon a change of control transaction, (ii) dissolution of the Company, or (iii) another outcome outside of (i)-(ii). These estimates require significant judgment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unobservable inputs were as follows:

Pursuant to an underwritten public offering in June 2023, we issued the Tranche A Warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock at 22.00 per share. In accordance with ASC 815, we recognized the Tranche A Warrants as derivative liabilities measured at fair value and will remeasure them at each reporting date and record the change in fair value as a component of other income (expense), net, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The change in fair value of the Tranche A Warrants resulted in a gain of 0.6 million and a gain of 5.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and a gain of 0.9 million and a gain of 5.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We estimate the fair value using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with probability weights for the occurrence of the following events: (i) FDA acceptance of an NDA for CNM-Au8, (ii) settlement upon a fundamental transaction, (iii) dissolution of the Company, and (iv) another outcome outside of (i)-(iii).

Income Taxes 
 
 We account for uncertainty in income taxes by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements. First, the tax position is evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by estimating the future taxable profits expected and considering prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The estimation of these factors requires significant judgment. Based on our evaluation of these factors, we have not recorded income tax benefits for the net operating losses or for research and development tax credits or other deferred tax assets due to uncertainty of realizing benefits from these items. 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 We account for stock-based compensation arrangements using a fair value-based method for costs related to all share-based payments including stock options and stock awards. The fair value is recognized over the period during which a grantee was required to provide services in exchange for the option award and service-based stock awards, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period), on a straight-line basis. For stock awards with market conditions, the fair value is recognized over the period based on the expected milestone achievement dates as the derived service period (usually the vesting period), on a straight-line basis. For stock awards with performance conditions, the grant-date fair value of these awards is the market price on the applicable grant date, and compensation expense will be recognized when the conditions become probable of being satisfied. We will recognize a cumulative true-up adjustment once the conditions become probable of being satisfied as the related service period had been completed in a prior period. We elect to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating expected forfeitures.

We estimate the fair value of restricted stock awards using a Monte Carlo valuation model to simulate the achievement of certain stock price milestones. The unobservable inputs include the expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected term. No restricted stock awards were granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide information required by this Item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). As a result of this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, believes the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly represent, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 In connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified relate to the fact that we did not design or maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. This deficiency in our control environment contributed to the following additional material weaknesses related to control activities and information and communication within our internal control over financial reporting: 

we did not design and maintain controls over the preparation and review of reconciliations and the review and segregation of duties over manual journal entries, including controls over the completeness and accuracy of information; and 

42

Table of Contents 

we did not design and maintain information technology IT general controls for IT systems that are relevant to the preparation of the financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain: (a) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and that adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs, and data to our appropriate personnel; (b) program change management controls to ensure that IT program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately; (c) computer operations controls to ensure that data backups are authorized and monitored; and (d) testing and approval controls for program development to ensure that new software development is aligned with business and IT requirements. 

Each of the control deficiencies described above could result in a misstatement of one or more account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, our management has determined that each of the control deficiencies described above constitute material weaknesses. 
 
 Material Weakness Remediation 
 
 Management continues to be actively engaged and committed to taking the steps necessary to remediate the control deficiencies that constituted the above material weaknesses. During 2023, we made the following enhancements to our control environment: 

we have continued to strengthen the experience of our internal accounting team through refinement of our processes and internal controls over financial reporting and our IT and technical accounting resources; and 

until we have sufficient technical accounting resources, we have engaged external consultants to provide support and to assist us in our evaluation of more complex applications of GAAP. 

Our remediation activities are continuing during 2024. In addition to the above actions, we expect to engage in additional activities, or have completed additional activities, including, but not limited to: 

adding more technical accounting resources to enhance our control environment; and 

until we have sufficient technical accounting resources, engaging external consultants to provide support and to assist us in our evaluation of more complex applications of GAAP. 

We continue to enhance corporate oversight over process-level controls and structures to ensure that there is appropriate assignment of authority, responsibility, and accountability to enable remediation of our material weaknesses. We believe that our remediation plan will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weaknesses and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. As we continue to evaluate, and work to improve, our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine that additional measures to address control deficiencies or modifications to the remediation plan are necessary. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than changes described under Material Weakness Remediation , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
