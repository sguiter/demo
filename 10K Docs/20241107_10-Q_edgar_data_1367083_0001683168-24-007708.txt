 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 (Rounded to nearest thousand unless specified) 

 (Unaudited) 

The reverse stock split has been retroactively applied to all share and per share amounts in the
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP for interim financial statements and are in the form prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC in instructions
to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting
of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the Company s financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods indicated. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for
the year ended March 31, 2024, and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the
SEC on June 17, 2024. 

and 
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the six months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company s accumulated deficit amounted to 
 and , respectively. The Company had working capital of and as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024,
respectively. The cash balance at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 was and , respectively. During the six months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in operating activities amounted to and , respectively. 

Management believes that the Company has access to
additional capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means;
however, the Company cannot provide any assurance that other new financings will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if needed.
If the economic climate in the U.S. deteriorates, the Company s ability to raise additional capital could be negatively impacted.
If the Company is unable to secure additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve
its cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet its obligations. These measures could cause significant delays in the Company s
continued efforts to commercialize its products, which is critical to the realization of its business plan and the future operations of
the Company. This uncertainty along with the Company s history of losses indicates that there is substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern. 

Denominator: 

Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding: basic and diluted 

Net loss per share: basic and diluted 

The computation of basic loss per share for the three and six months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023 excludes the potentially dilutive securities summarized in the table below because their inclusion would be
anti-dilutive.

Sales to stocking distributors are made under terms
with fixed pricing and limited rights of return (known as stock rotation of the Company s products held in their
inventory. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon the transfer of control to the distributor. 

The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of new
customers and monitors the creditworthiness of its existing customers to determine whether an event or changes in their financial circumstances
would raise doubt as to the collectability of a sale at the time in which a sale is made. Payment terms on sales are generally 30 to 90 days. 

The Company assessed the promised goods and services
in the technical support contract with Invekra for a ten-year period as being a distinct service that Invekra can benefit from on its
own and as separately identifiable from any other promises within the contract. Given that the distinct service is not substantially the
same as other goods and services within the Invekra contract, the Company accounted for the distinct service as a performance obligation.

calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying stock options and the fair value of the Company s common
stock, or per share at September 30, 2024. 

Restricted stock award activity is as follows: 

Restricted stock awards granted

and , respectively. The Company s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended
September 30, 2024 differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to the valuation allowance recognized against deferred
tax assets in the U.S., and permanent tax adjustment of intercompany interest expense in Mexico and Netherlands. 

Judgment is required in determining whether deferred
tax assets will be realized in full or in part. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictional basis
to estimate if deferred tax assets will be recognized and when it is more likely than not that all or some deferred tax assets will not
be realized, and a valuation allowance must be established. As of September 30, 2024, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance

Our Business 

We are a global healthcare leader for developing and
producing stabilized hypochlorous acid, or HOCl, products for a wide range of applications, including wound care, eye care, oral care,
dermatological conditions, podiatry, animal health care and non-toxic disinfectants. Our products are clinically proven to reduce itch,
pain, scarring, and irritation safely and without damaging healthy tissue. In-vitro and clinical studies of HOCl show it to safely manage
skin abrasions, lacerations, minor irritations, cuts, and intact skin. We sell our products either directly or via partners in 55 countries
worldwide. 

16 

Business Channels 

Our core market differentiation is based on being
the leading developer and producer of stabilized hypochlorous acid, or HOCl, solutions. We have been in business for over 20 years, and
in that time, we have developed significant scientific knowledge of how best to develop and manufacture HOCl products backed by decades
of studies and data collection. HOCl is known to be among the safest and most-effective ways to relieve itch, inflammation and burns while
stimulating natural healing through increased oxygenation and eliminating persistent microorganisms and biofilms. 

We sell our products into many markets both in the
U.S. and internationally. In international markets, we ship a variety of products to 55 countries. Our core strategy is to work with partners
both in the United States and around the world to market and distribute our products. In some cases, we market and sell our own products. 

Dermatology 

We have developed unique, differentiated, prescription-strength
and safe dermatologic products that support paths to healing among various key dermatologic conditions. Our products are primarily targeted
at the treatment of redness and irritation, the management of scars and symptoms of eczema/atopic dermatitis. We are strategically focused
on introducing innovative new products that are supported by human clinical data with applications that address specific dermatological
procedures currently in demand. In addition, we look for markets where we can provide effective product line extensions and pricing to
new product families. 

In the United States, we sell our prescription and
office dispense dermatology products through a distributor, including Epicyn Facial Cleanser, Levicyn Antimicrobial Dermal Spray,
Levicyn Gel, Levicyn Spray Gel, Celacyn Scar Management Gel, Lasercyn Dermal Spray and Lasercyn Gel . 

In October 2022,
we launched two new over-the-counter dermatology products in the United States, Reliefacyn Advanced Itch-Burn-Rash-Pain
Relief Hydrogel for the alleviation of red bumps, rashes, shallow skin fissures, peeling, and symptoms of eczema/atopic dermatitis, and
Rejuvacyn Advanced Skin Repair Cooling Mist for management of minor skin irritations following cosmetic procedures as
well as daily skin health and hydration. 

In June 2022, the Natural Products Association certified
Rejuvacyn Advanced as a Natural Personal Care Product. Reliefacyn Advanced received the National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance TM 
in 2023. 

In January 2023, we launched a line of office dispense
products exclusively for skin care professionals, including two new prescription strength dermatology products, Reliefacyn Plus Advanced
Itch-Burn-Rash-Pain Relief Hydrogel and Rejuvacyn Plus Skin Repair Cooling Mist .
These products, along with Regenacyn Plus Scar Gel, are marketed and sold directly to dermatology
practices and medical spas. 

In January 2024,
we launched Lumacyn TM Clarifying Mist, a direct-to-consumer skin care product in the United States. Lumacyn is an all-natural
daily toner to soothe skin, reduce redness and irritation, and manage blemishes by reducing infection. 

Our consumer products are available
through Amazon.com, our online store and third-party distributors. 

We sell dermatology products in Europe and Asia through
distributors. In these international markets, we have a network of partners, ranging from country specific distributors to large pharmaceutical
companies to full-service sales and marketing companies. We work with our international partners to create products they can market in
their home country. Some products we develop and manufacture are custom label while others use branding we have already developed. We
have created or co-developed a wide range of products for international markets using our core HOCl technology. 

17 

First Aid and Wound Care 

Our HOCl-based wound care products are intended for
the treatment of acute and chronic wounds as well as first- and second-degree burns, and as an intraoperative irrigation treatment. They
work by first removing foreign material and debris from the skin surface and moistening the skin, thereby improving wound healing. Secondly,
our HOCl products assist in the wound healing process by removing microorganisms. HOCl is an important constituent of our innate immune
system, formed and released by the macrophages during phagocytosis. Highly organized cell structures such as human tissue can tolerate
the action of our wound care solution while single-celled microorganisms cannot, making our products advantageous to other wound-irrigation
and antiseptic solutions. Due to its unique chemistry, our wound treatment solution is also much more stable than similar products on
the market and therefore maintains much higher levels of hypochlorous acid over its shelf life. 

In the United States, we sell our wound care products
directly to hospitals, physicians, nurses, and other healthcare practitioners and indirectly through non-exclusive distribution arrangements.
In Europe, the Middle East and Asia, we sell our wound care products through a diverse network of distributors. 

In March 2021, we received approval to market and
use our HOCl products as biocides under Article 95 of the European Biocidal Products Regulation in France, Germany and Portugal. The approval
applies to our products MucoClyns for human hygiene to be marketed and commercialized by us, MicrocynAH for animal
heath marketed and commercialized through our partner, Petagon Limited, and MicroSafe for disinfectant use to be marketed and commercialized
through our partner, MicroSafe Group DMCC. 

In June 2022, the Natural Products Association certified
Microcyn OTC as a Natural Personal Care Product in the United States. 

In June 2023, we announced a new application of our
HOCl technology for intraoperative pulse lavage irrigation treatment, which can replace commonly used IV bags in a variety of surgical
procedures. The intraoperative pulse lavage container is designed to be used in combination with a pulse lavage irrigation device, or
flush gun, for abdominal, laparoscopic, orthopedic, and periprosthetic procedures. It is in trial use by hospitals in Europe and launched
in the U.S. in November 2023. 

In April 2024, we announced expansion of our Microcyn
Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Solution products line, now available in 250mL, 450mL and 990mL sizes to meet the diverse needs of healthcare
professionals and patients. 

In July 2024, we announced an expansion of our distributor
base in Europe through a new partnership with Smart Healthcare Company (SHC) s.r.o. for the distribution of Microdacyn60 
wound care products into Ukraine. 

In August, 2024, we entered into a distribution agreement
with Medline Industries, LP, for the marketing and distribution of our wound care products in the United States. The agreement is for
an initial term of five years, subject to automatic one-year renewal periods. In October 2024, we entered into an amendment to the agreement
which allows Medline to also sell our wound care products in Canada, as well as to sell additional over-the-counter wound care products
to retailers in both countries. 

Eye Care 

In September 2021, we launched
Ocucyn Eyelid Eyelash Cleanser, which is sold directly to consumers on Amazon.com, through our online store, and
through third party distributors. Ocucyn Eyelid Eyelash Cleanser, designed for everyday use, is a safe, gentle, and effective solution
for good eyelid and eyelash hygiene. 

Our prescription product
Acuicyn Eyelid Eyelash Cleanser is a prescription solution for symptoms of blepharitis and the daily hygiene of eyelids and
lashes and helps manage red, itchy, crusty and inflamed eyes. It is strong enough to kill the bacteria that causes discomfort, fast enough
to provide near instant relief, and gentle enough to use as often as needed.

In international markets
we rely on distribution partners to sell our eye products. In May 2020, we entered into an expanded license and distribution agreement
with our existing partner, Brill International S.L., for our Microdacyn60 Eye Care HOCl-based product. Under the license
and distribution agreement, Brill has the right to market and distribute our eye care product under the private label Ocudox in Italy,
Germany, Spain, Portugal, France, and the United Kingdom for a period of 10 years, subject to meeting annual minimum sales quantities.
In return, Brill paid us a one-time fee, and the agreed upon supply prices. In parts of Asia, Dyamed Biotech markets our eye product under
the private label Ocucyn. 

Oral, Dental and Nasal Care 

We sell a variety
of oral, dental, and nasal products around the world. 

In international markets, our product Microdacyn60

based on our HOCl technology is an electrolyzed solution intended for nasal irrigation. Sinudox clears and cleans stuffy, runny noses
and blocked or inflamed sinuses by ancillary ingredients that may have a local antimicrobial effect. Sinudox is currently sold through
Amazon in Europe. In other parts of the world, we partner with distributors to sell Sinudox. 

Podiatry 

Our HOCl-based wound care products are also indicated
for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. In the United States, we sell our wound care products directly to podiatrists as well as hospitals,
nurses, and other healthcare practitioners and indirectly through non-exclusive distribution arrangements. In Europe, we sell our wound
care products for podiatric use through a diverse network of distributors. 

In April 2023, we launched Podiacyn TM Advanced
Everyday Foot Care direct to consumers for over-the-counter use in the United States, intended for management of foot odors, infections,
and irritations, as well as daily foot health and hygiene. Podiacyn is available through Amazon.com, our online store and third-party

of a variety of animal afflictions including cuts, burns, lacerations, rashes, hot spots, rain rot, post-surgical sites, pink eye symptoms
and wounds to the outer ear. 

For our animal health products sold in the U.S. and
Canada, we partner with Compana Pet Brands. Compana distributes non-prescription products to national pet-store retail chains and farm
animal specialty stores, such as PetSmart, Tractor Supply, Cabela s, PetExpress, Bass Pro Shops, and Menards. In August 2022, we
announced the launch of a MicrocynVS line of products exclusively for veterinarians for the management of wound, skin,
ear and eye afflictions in all animal species. 

For the Asian
and European markets, in May 2019 we partnered with Petagon an international importer and distributor of quality pet food and products
for an initial term of five years. We supply Petagon with all MicrocynAH products sold by Petagon. In August 2020, Petagon received a
license from the People s Republic of China for the import of veterinary drug products manufactured by us. This is the highest classification
Petagon and Sonoma can receive for animal health products in China.

Surface Disinfectants 

Our HOCl technology has been formulated as a disinfectant
and sanitizer solution for our partner MicroSafe and is sold in numerous countries. It is designed to be used to spray in aerosol format
in areas and environments likely to serve as a breeding ground for the spread of infectious disease, which could result in epidemics or
pandemics. The medical-grade surface disinfectant solution is used in hospitals worldwide to protect doctors and patients. In May 2020,
Nanocyn Disinfectant Sanitizer received approval to be entered into the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods,
or ARTG for use against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, and was also authorized in Canada for use against COVID-19. Nanocyn has
also met the stringent environmental health and social/ethical criteria of Good Environmental Choice Australia, or GECA, becoming one
of the very few eco-certified, all-natural disinfectant solutions in Australia. 

Through our partner MicroSafe, we sell hard surface
disinfectant products into Europe, the Middle East and Australia. 

In July 2021, we granted MicroSafe the non-exclusive
right to sell and distribute Nanocyn in the United States provided that MicroSafe secure U.S. EPA approval. In April of 2022, MicroSafe
secured the EPA approval for Nanocyn Disinfectant Sanitizer, meaning that it can now be sold in the United States as a surface
disinfectant, and it was subsequently added to the EPA s list N for use against COVID-19. In June 2022, the EPA added Nanocyn to
List Q as a disinfectant for Emerging Viral Pathogens, including Ebola virus, Mpox, and SARS-CoV-2, and in March 2023 the EPA added Nanocyn
to Lists G and H, for use against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), Salmonella, Norovirus, Poliovirus, and as a fungicide.
Nanocyn also received the Green Seal Certification after surpassing a series of rigorous standards that measure environmental
health, sustainability and product performance. Nanocyn is currently sold by MicroSafe in Europe, the Middle East and Australia. 

In August 2024, we announced that the Australian TGA
approved extended claims for Nanocyn for use against Candida auris (C. auris) and Clostritium Difficile (C. diff.) in ten minutes.

The increase in United States revenue of 85,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in eye care and dermatology revenue. 

The increase in Europe revenue for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 of 305,000 was the result of a general increase in demand for our products. 

The increase in Latin America revenue for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 of 205,000 was primarily due to an increase in manufacturing orders. 

The increase in Asia revenue of 430,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to timing of customer orders. The decrease in Rest of World revenue for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 of 177,000 was primarily due to timing of customer orders. Revenues from these regions tend to be choppy when
viewed on a quarterly basis due to customers placing larger, but less frequent, orders to benefit from quantity discounts and reduced
shipping costs when ordering larger quantities.

Sources of Liquidity 

Since our inception, substantially all of our operations
have been financed through sales of equity securities. Other sources of financing that we have used to date include our revenues, as well
as various loans and the sale of certain assets to customers. 

Since October 1, 2023, substantially all of our operations
have been financed through cash on hand and the following transactions: 

Proceeds of 1,446,000, net of offering expenses, from the sale of common stock on October 26, 2023. 

Proceeds of 343,000, net of offering expenses, from the sale of common stock on January 11, 2024.

of principal payments on a short-term loan related to financing of insurance premiums. 

Net cash used in financing activities was 264,000
for the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to principal payments on short-term debt. 

Material Trends and Uncertainties 

We rely on certain key customers for a significant
portion of our revenues. In the future, a small number of customers may continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues
in any given period. These customers may not consistently purchase our products at a particular rate over any subsequent period. 

We are exposed to risk from foreign currency devaluation
for both the Mexico Peso and the Euro versus the US dollar. Risk related to foreign currency valuation tends to be unpredictable and can
be affected by various factors outside of our control. 

We face a substantial Mexico
tax liability, intercompany debt, unpaid technical assistance charges and accrued interest. These amounts are due in 2027. At this time,
management believes there are sufficient assets on the balance sheet to more than cover any tax obligation without interrupting our operations
or business. We have engaged tax professionals to review all options to limit our exposure to these amounts and to proceed in a manner
that is most advantageous to us. 

We also closely monitor overall
economic conditions and consumer sentiment and the prospect of a recession in the United States which may impact our financial results. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the dates of the condensed
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could
differ from these estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions include reserves and write-downs related to receivables and inventories,
the valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets, valuation of equity and the estimated amortization periods of upfront product
licensing fees received from customers. Periodically, we evaluate and adjust estimates accordingly. 

Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 

We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

26 

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2
of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore
are not required to provide the information requested by this Item. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) as of the end of our most recent fiscal quarter. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the fact that material weaknesses
in our internal controls over financial reporting exist at period end. 

Notwithstanding our ineffective disclosure controls
and procedures, management believes the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present
fairly, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended
to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the 2013 Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based
on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024.
We determined that there was a lack of separation of duties with preparation and review of the reported numbers, among other things. We
believe we have taken steps to correct this, but the controls are currently being tested and have not been working for a sufficient period
of time to remove this weakness. 

27 

Management s Remediation Measures 

Management, with oversight from the Audit Committee
of our Board of Directors, is actively engaged in remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses identified in the management s
evaluation of internal controls and procedures. Management has taken a number of actions to remediate the material weaknesses described
above, including the following: 

Improved monitoring and risk assessment activities to address these control deficiencies. 

Hired an experienced Chief Financial Officer and Controller in 2023. 

Separated the preparation of the financial reports from review of the financial reports. 

Developed and delivered further internal controls training to individuals associated with these control deficiencies and enhanced training provided to all personnel who have financial reporting or internal control responsibilities in these areas. The training includes a review of individual roles and responsibilities related to internal controls, proper oversight and reemphasizes the importance of completing the control procedures. 

These improvements are targeted at strengthening our
internal control over financial reporting and remediating the material weaknesses. We remain committed to an effective internal control
environment, and management believes that these actions and the improvements management expects to achieve as a result will effectively
remediate the material weaknesses. However, the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be considered
remediated until the controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing that these controls
operate effectively. As of the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management is in the process of testing and evaluating
these additional controls to determine whether they are operating effectively. We have hired appropriate accounting staff to establish
effective internal controls and processes. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not finished testing our controls and sufficient time has not elapsed to
make the determination these controls are operating effectively.

 CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT

Exhibit 14.1 

Code of Business Conduct 
Revised November 5, 2024 

 Introduction 

It is the general policy of Sonoma Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the
 Company to conduct its business activities and transactions with the highest level of integrity and ethical standards and
in accordance with all applicable laws. In carrying out this policy, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted the following Code
of Business Conduct (the Code in order to promote: 

honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
relationships; 

full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in other public communications made by the Company; 

compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations; 

the prompt internal reporting of violations of the code to an appropriate person or persons identified in this Code; and 

accountability for adherence to this Code. 

This Code covers a wide range of business practices and procedures.
It does not cover every issue that may arise, but it sets out basic principles to guide all employees, officers and directors of the Company.
All such persons must conduct themselves accordingly and seek to avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. Those who violate the
standards in this Code or who fail to cooperate with management directions given to effect compliance with this Code may be subject to
disciplinary action, possibly including termination of employment. For guidance with respect to issues not addressed in this Code, employees
should follow the Company s internal policies and procedures. 

If you have any questions regarding this Code, you should address these
questions to your supervisor, or to the general counsel or other person identified by the Company as its compliance officer (the Compliance
Officer ). 

1 

Basic Principles and Practices 

Honest and Ethical Conduct 

The Company s policy is to promote high standards of integrity
by conducting its affairs honestly and ethically. Each director, officer and employee must act with integrity and observe the highest
ethical standards of business conduct in their dealings with the Company s customers, suppliers, partners, service providers, competitors,
employees and anyone else with whom they have contact in the course of performing their job. 

Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations 

Company policy requires that our business activities comply with both
the letter and the spirit of all applicable laws, rules and regulations. The Company s products are subject to a variety of laws
and regulations that govern healthcare and pharmaceutical products, including marketing approvals, conduct of clinical studies, good manufacturing
practices and standards, labeling and advertising/promotion requirements. Although not all employees, directors or officers are expected
to know the details of these laws, it is important to know enough to determine when to seek advice from supervisors, managers or other
appropriate personnel or counsel. 

Confidentiality 

Directors, officers and employees should maintain the confidentiality
of information entrusted to them by the Company or by its customers, suppliers or partners, except when disclosure is expressly authorized
or legally required. Employees, directors and officers who come into possession of non-public Company information must safeguard the information
from the public and not intentionally or inadvertently communicate it to any person (including family members and friends) unless the
person has a need to know the information for legitimate, Company-related reasons. This duty of confidentiality is important both as to
the Company s competitive position and with respect to the securities laws applicable to the Company as a public company. Confidential
information cannot be disclosed by any employee, director and officer to any third party unless the third party has signed a nondisclosure
agreement approved by the Company s management, and should be divulged only to persons having a need to know the information in
order to carry out their job responsibilities. You must also abide by any specific agreements, such as an Employment, Confidential Information
and Invention Assignment, regarding confidentiality between you and the Company. 

Consistent with the foregoing, all employees, directors and officers
should be discreet with respect to confidential information about the Company and not discuss it in public places. 

Confidential information related to the Company can include a variety
of materials and information regarding the ongoing operations and plans of the Company, and also includes information that customers or
collaborators have provided to the Company. For example, confidential information can include product development plans, clinical and
research results, regulatory matters, patents, trademarks, copyrights, laboratory processes, product information, information regarding
the financial health of the Company, salary and personnel information and marketing and sales plans. 

Nothing in this Code shall prevent employees, directors or officers
from reporting suspected wrongdoing to the SEC. 

2 

Conflicts of Interest 

A conflict of interest arises when a person s loyalties
or actions are divided between the interests of the Company and those of another, such as a competitor, supplier or customer, or personal
business. A conflict of interest can arise when an employee, director or officer (or a member of their family) takes actions or has interests
that may make it difficult to perform their work objectively and effectively. A conflict of interest may also arise when an employee,
director or officer, or members of their family, receives an improper personal benefit as a result of their position in, or relationship
with, the Company. Moreover, the appearance of a conflict of interest alone can adversely affect the Company and its relations with customers,
suppliers and employees. 

Employees, directors and officers are expected to use good judgment,
to adhere to high ethical standards and to avoid situations that create an actual or potential conflict of interest. It is almost always
a conflict of interest for employees or officers to work simultaneously for a competitor, customer or supplier. In this regard, employees
shall not have any undisclosed financial interest in any competitor, supplier, customer, or strategic partner if that interest would create
a conflict of interest with the Company. If there is such an interest, the employee should disclose the nature of the interest to the
Compliance Officer; provided, however, that employees, directors and officers may maintain small investments in publicly held companies
in which such individual has no influence or control. 

 A conflict of interest can also arise with respect to employment of
relatives and persons with close personal relationships. If an employee or someone with whom an employee has a close relationship (e.g.,
a family member or close companion) has a financial or employment relationship with an actual or potential competitor, supplier or customer,
the employee must disclose this fact in writing to the Compliance Officer. The Company may take any action that it deems necessary in
its sole discretion to avoid or remedy an actual, prospective or perceived conflict of interest, including a reassignment of some or all
of the employee s duties or change of the employee s position. 

Loans by the Company to, or guarantees by the Company of obligations
of, employees or their family members are of special concern and could constitute improper personal benefits to the recipients of such
loans or guarantees, depending on the facts and circumstances. Loans by the Company to, or guarantees by the Company of obligations of,
any director or officer or their family members are expressly prohibited. 

A conflict of interest may not always be clear; therefore, employees
should consult with higher levels of management in case of any questions. Any employee who becomes aware of a conflict or a potential
conflict should bring it to the attention of the Compliance Officer. Directors and executive officers must seek determinations and prior
authorizations or approvals of potential conflicts of interest exclusively from the Audit Committee. 

Corporate Opportunities 

All employees, directors and officers owe a duty to the Company to
advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises. Employees, directors and officers are prohibited from taking for
themselves personally (or for the benefit of friends or family members) opportunities that are discovered through the use of Company assets,
property or confidential information or their position without the consent of the Board or its designees. No employee, director or officer
may use corporate property, information or their position for improper personal gain (including gain of friends or family members), and
no employee, director or officer may compete with the Company directly or indirectly while they are engaged or employed by the Company. 

Fair Dealing 

Although the prosperity of our Company depends on our ability to outperform
our competitors, the Company is committed to achieving success by fair and ethical means. We seek to maintain a reputation for honesty
and fair dealing among our competitors and the public alike. Each employee, director and officer must deal fairly with the Company s
customers, suppliers, competitors, employees, service providers and anyone else with whom they have contact in the course of performing
their job. No employee, director or officer should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged
information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair business practice. 

3 

Company personnel are prohibited from receiving a payment or anything
of value from a vendor or other entities/individuals in the private sector in exchange for a purchasing decision, subject to exception
for gifts or nominal value (e.g. non-lavish meals, marketing materials, t-shirts, caps, etc.). 

Donations, Gifts, Payments to Customers and Physicians 

The U.S. and most other countries have laws and regulations that govern
the Company s provision of donations, gifts, or payments to customers or physicians. The Company s policy is that its employees,
directors and officers will comply with all such laws and regulations. The Company will not pay or otherwise remunerate a physician or
customer in exchange for ordering, prescribing, purchasing, or recommending the Company s products. All business courtesies such
as meals, transportation, and entertainment provided to a physician or customer must be modest in amount and related to a legitimate business
purpose. Donations to customers or organizations closely affiliated with customers shall entail a benefit to society and be made to promote
better health care, demonstrate good corporate leadership, or serve a genuine educational function. The Company may enter into legitimate
agreements to compensate customers and physicians for consulting, research, or other services rendered, and reasonable costs incurred,
where the services have value to the Company and are provided for fair market value. All such agreements must be in writing. 

Advertising and Promotion 

The advertising and promotion of the Company s products are subject
to extensive regulation. For example, companies may not promote medical device or drug products or product indications that are not approved
by regulatory authorities. These regulations also require that employees, directors and officers represent the Company s products
in a manner consistent with applicable labeling and market approvals. It is the Company s policy to promote and market its products
in a lawful and truthful manner in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. To help ensure compliance in this area, all promotional
materials must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate internal departments prior to distribution. 

Health and Safety 

The Company strives to provide a safe and healthy work environment.
All employees are responsible for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all other employees by following the Company s safety
and health rules, policies and practices and reporting accidents, injuries and unsafe equipment, practices or conditions. 

Insider Trading 

No director, officer or employee may purchase or sell any Company securities
while in possession of material non-public information regarding the Company, nor may any director, officer or employee purchase or sell
another company s securities while in possession of material non-public information regarding that company. Employees, directors
and officers are not permitted to use, share or disseminate confidential information for stock trading purposes or for any other purpose
except the conduct of our business. To use confidential information for personal financial benefit or to tip others who
might make an investment decision on the basis of this information is not only unethical but also illegal. 

Payments to Government Personnel 

The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits giving anything
of value, directly or indirectly, to officials of foreign governments or foreign political candidates in order to obtain or retain business.
It is strictly prohibited to make illegal payments to government officials of any country. 

In addition, the United States government has a number of laws
and regulations regarding business gratuities which may be accepted by U.S. government personnel. The promise, offer or delivery to an
official or employee of the U.S. government of a gift, favor, or other gratuity in violation of these rules would not only violate Company
policy but could also be a criminal offense. State and local governments, as well as foreign governments, may have similar rules. 

4 

Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets 

No secret or unrecorded fund of Company assets or cash shall be established
or maintained for any purpose. Anyone spending or obligating Company funds should be certain that the transaction is properly and appropriately
documented and that the Company receives appropriate value in return. 

All employees, directors and officers should endeavor to protect
the Company s assets and ensure their efficient use. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the Company s profitability
and are prohibited. Any suspected incident of fraud or theft should be immediately reported for investigation. Company assets should only
be used for legitimate Company business, though incidental personal use may be permitted. 

The obligation to protect Company assets includes the Company s
proprietary information. Proprietary information includes intellectual property such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and copyrights,
as well as business and marketing plans, engineering and manufacturing ideas, designs, databases, records and any non-public financial
data or reports. Unauthorized use or distribution of this information is prohibited and could also be illegal and result in civil or criminal
penalties. 

Record Keeping 

The Company requires honest and accurate recording and reporting of
information in order to make responsible business decisions. If you use a business expense account, expenses to be reimbursed must be
documented and recorded accurately. If you are not sure whether an expense is appropriate, ask your supervisor. 

All of the Company s books, records, accounts and financial statements
must be maintained in reasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Company s transactions and must conform both to applicable
legal requirements and to the Company s system of internal controls. All Company business data, records and reports must be prepared
truthfully and accurately. The Company s business records must be maintained for the periods specified in the Company s applicable
record retention policies. 

Employees, directors and officers who contribute to or prepare the
Company s public filings, submissions or communications should do so in accordance with the following guidelines: 

All accounting records, as well as reports produced from those records, must be prepared in accordance with the laws of each applicable jurisdiction. 

All records must fairly and accurately reflect the transactions or occurrences to which they relate. 

All records must fairly and accurately reflect, in reasonable detail, the Company s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 

The Company s accounting records must not contain any false or intentionally misleading entries. 

No transactions should be intentionally misclassified as to accounts, departments or accounting periods. 

All transactions must be supported by accurate documentation in reasonable detail and recorded in the proper account and in the proper accounting period. 

No information should be concealed from the Company s auditors. 

Compliance with the Company s system of internal accounting controls is required. 

5 

Business records and communications often become public, and employees,
directors and officers should avoid exaggeration, derogatory remarks, guesswork or inappropriate characterizations of people and companies
that can be misunderstood. This applies equally to e-mail, internal memos and formal reports. 

Disclosure 

The Company s periodic reports and other documents filed with
the SEC, including all financial statements and other financial information, must comply with applicable federal securities laws and SEC
rules. 

Each director, officer and employee who contributes in any way to the
preparation or verification of the Company s financial statements and other financial information must ensure that the Company s
books, records and accounts are accurately maintained. Each director, officer and employee must cooperate fully with the Company s
accounting and internal audit departments, as well as the Company s independent public accountants and counsel. 

Each director, officer and employee who is involved in the Company s
disclosure process must (a) be familiar with and comply with the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control
over financial reporting; and (b) take all necessary steps to ensure that all filings with the SEC and all other public communications
about the financial and business condition of the Company provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure. 

Implementation 

All employees, officers and directors must sign a statement certifying
that they have read and understand this Code and are aware of the consequences of non-compliance with it; such certification shall be
renewed annually. Violations of this Code or of any direction given by management in order to effect the provisions, goals, and aims of
this Code may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 

Waiver 

Any waiver of this Code for executive officers or directors may be
made only in writing (including an explanation of the reason for such waiver) by the Board of Directors, and will be promptly disclosed
as required by SEC and Nasdaq rules. Any waiver of this Code for other employees must be approved in writing by the Compliance Officer. 

Reporting Violations of this Code 

Employees, directors and officers are responsible for being aware of
the corporate policies applicable to their activities and to comply with them fully. If you become aware of a violation of this Code or
believe that a violation may take place in the future, you must promptly report the matter. Failure to report a known violation allows
misconduct to go unremedied and is itself grounds for discipline. Ordinarily, the report may be made to the employee s immediate
supervisor, the human resources department, the general counsel of the Company or any senior manager of the Company, who, in turn, must
report it to the Compliance Officer. If the report pertains to concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, the employee
should direct the report to the Compliance Officer or to the Chair of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Directors and management
of the Company shall report any material violations of this Code to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Actions prohibited
by this Code involving directors or executive officers must be reported to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee shall, on a periodic
basis review the Code and discuss its implementation and any potential revisions to the Code with the Board of Directors. 

6 

Reports concerning potential violations of this Code may also be made
using the Company s designated hotline, and may be anonymous, at the employee s discretion. Contact information is provided
at the time of hire and posted in the Company s offices. 

After receiving a report of an alleged prohibited action, the Audit
Committee or the Compliance Officer must promptly take all appropriate actions necessary to investigate. All directors, officers and employees
are expected to cooperate in any internal investigation of misconduct. 

Employees, directors and officers submitting a report on an anonymous
basis are strongly encouraged to keep a copy of the report (if made in writing) and a record of the time and date of their submission,
as well as a description of the matter as reported if the report was not in writing. 

Employees, directors and officers are encouraged to provide as much
specific information as possible, including names, dates, places and events that took place, relevant documents and the employee s
perception of why the incident(s) may be misconduct. 

If possible, the individual should provide a means by which she/he
can be contacted in the event that an investigator needs to follow-up or wants to report back to the employee. 

The Company does not tolerate acts of retaliation against any director,
officer or employee who makes a good faith report of known or suspected acts of misconduct or other violations of this Code. We will not
allow retaliation against an employee, director or officer for reporting a possible violation of this Code unless it can be shown that
the report was knowingly false. Retaliation for reporting a federal offense is illegal under federal law and prohibited under this Code.
Such retaliation will result in discipline up to and including termination of employment and may also result in criminal prosecution.
The employee, director or officer is protected from retaliation even if the investigator does not agree that there has been a violation.
However, if the employee, director or officer making the report was involved in improper activity, the fact that they reported it will
not necessarily prevent him or her from being disciplined for their participation in the violation. In these circumstances, the Company
may consider the individual s conduct in promptly reporting the information as a mitigating factor in any disciplinary decision. 

Enforcement 

The Company must ensure prompt and consistent action against violations
of this Code. If, after investigating a report of an alleged prohibited action by a director or executive officer, the Audit Committee
determines that a violation of this Code has occurred, the Audit Committee will report such determination to the Board of Directors. 

If, after investigating a report of an alleged prohibited action by
any other person, the Compliance Officer determines that a violation of this Code has occurred, the Compliance Officer will report such
determination to the Audit Committee. 

Upon receipt of a determination that there has been a violation
of this Code, the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee will take such preventative or disciplinary action as it deems appropriate,
including, but not limited to, reassignment, demotion, dismissal and, in the event of criminal conduct or other serious violations of
the law, notification of appropriate governmental authorities.
