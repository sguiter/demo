Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements (as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that reflect our current expectations and views of future

 intend, plan, believe, is/are likely to, potential, continue 
or other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning our expected financial
performance and our ability to operate our business and execute our anticipated business plans and strategy. We have based these forward-looking
statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events that we believe may affect our financial condition,
results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. Although we believe that our expectations expressed in these forward-looking
statements are reasonable, our expectations may later be found to be incorrect. Our actual results of operations or the results of other
matters that we anticipate herein could be materially different from our expectations. Accordingly, readers are cautioned that significant
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include: 

our ability to continue
 as a going concern and to meet our financial obligations as they become due; 

our ability to obtain additional
 capital, in particular while we are in default under various of our obligations, including certain of our indebtedness, which will
 be necessary to continue our business and operations;

 under our current business model and history of net losses;

 inflation, war, other hostilities, and other disruptive events on our business or that of our customers, partners, and supply chain
 or on the global economy; 

our ability to successfully
 remediate and prevent material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting; 

our ability to comply with
 the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq (including the requirement to maintain a minimum market value of publicly held shares
 of 15,000,000, a minimum market value of listed securities of 50,000,000 for which we have received a deficiency notice) and maintain
 our listing on Nasdaq; and 

other risks and uncertainties
 described under the section titled Risk Factors herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year
 ended March 31, 2024,which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 15, 2024 Form 10-K/A and
 subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange
 Commission on August 14, 2024. 

You
should thoroughly read this report and the documents that we refer to with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially
different from, and worse than, what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 

The
forward-looking statements made in this report relate only to events or information as of the date of this report. Except as required
by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,

per share. The Company s
Common Stock and Warrants commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Market Nasdaq under the symbols ZCAR and
 ZCARW, respectively, on December 28, 2023. Refer to Note 3 to these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more
information on the Reverse Recapitalization. 

Zoomcar,
Inc., determined that it was the accounting acquirer in the Reverse Recapitalization based on an analysis of the criteria outlined in
ASC 805, Business Combinations . 

Accordingly, for accounting purposes,
the Reverse Recapitalization was treated as the equivalent of Zoomcar, Inc., issuing stock for the net assets of IOAC. The primary asset
acquired from IOAC was cash that was assumed. Separately, the Company also assumed warrants that were reclassified to equity upon close
of the Reverse Recapitalization. No goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded as a result of the Reverse Recapitalization. 

While IOAC was the legal acquirer
in the Reverse Recapitalization, because Zoomcar, Inc., was deemed to be the accounting acquirer, the historical financial statements
of Zoomcar, Inc., became the historical financial statements of the combined entity upon the consummation of the Reverse Recapitalization.
As a result, the financial statements included in this report reflect (i) the historical operating results of Zoomcar, Inc., prior to
the Reverse Recapitalization; (ii) the results of the combined entity following the Closing of the Reverse Recapitalization; (iii) sum
of the assets and liabilities of both Zoomcar, Inc., and the SPAC at their historical cost; and (iv) the combined entity s equity
structure for all periods presented.

Financial Statements have been prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets and
settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred a net loss of and during the three
months and six months ended September 30, 2024, and cash used in operations was for the six months ended September 30, 2024.
The Company s accumulated deficit amounts to (March 2024: ). The Company has negative working capital of
 as on September 30, 2024. In addition, the Company s cash position is critically deficient and critical payments to
the operational and financial creditors of the Company are not being made in the ordinary course of business, all of which raises substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company expects to continue to
incur net losses and have significant cash outflows from operating activities for at least the next 12 months. Management has evaluated
the significance of the conditions described above in relation to the Company s ability to meet its obligations and concluded that,
without additional funding, the Company will not have sufficient funds to meet its obligations within one year from the date the Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements are issued. Management s plans with respect to these adverse financial conditions that caused
management to express substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern are as follows: 

a) In June 2024, Company entered into a letter agreement with Aegis Capital
Corp. Aegis pursuant to which Aegis will act as a placement agent to the Company in connection with a proposed private
placement of up to million of securities of the Company which consists of Company s Series A Preferred Stock and Series A warrants.
Pursuant to the above agreement, on November 7, 2024, the Company has received net proceeds of million (after deduction of fees
to the placement agent and other offering expenses amounting to million). The Company paid million from these net proceeds
towards the outstanding Redeemable Promissory Notes. Further, there is a holdback of million from the remaining proceeds for indemnification
of the placement agent in the financing. While this financing resulted in the payment of certain outstanding indebtedness, the Company
will still need to raise additional capital imminently in order to have sufficient capital. 

There can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to achieve its business plan, raise any additional capital or secure the additional financing necessary to implement
its current operating plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to increase its revenues
and eventually achieve profitable operations. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

5 Troubled Debt Restructuring (Continued) 

. 

Accounting considerations 

The Company assessed the transactions
under the guidance of ASC 470-60 Troubled Debt Restructuring to determine if the transactions qualified as troubled debt restructuring.
For a payable restructuring to be considered troubled, the debtor must be experiencing financial difficulty, and the creditor must have
granted a concession. The Company is experiencing financial difficulties such as continuous default in debt repayments, significant doubt
about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern, threat of being delisted from an exchange and vendors/lenders have granted
concessions during the three months ended September 30, 2024, hence the Company has accounted the concessions in accordance with ASC 470-60.
The outstanding liability of the restructured payables is significantly less than the carrying value of old payables and in accordance
with the guidance in ASC 470-60, gain on restructuring is recorded as the difference between future undiscounted cash flows and the carrying
value. 

The total gain on troubled debt restructuring recorded during the three
months ended September 30, 2024 is . Basic EPS was increased by prior to Reverse Stock Split) as a result of these
gains.

The claims made by the customers against the Company includes claims that have been made for amounts charged to customers by the Company
as damages for improper use of vehicles and/or physical damages made to vehicles during an active trip ; or claims made by customers for
unavailability of the booked vehicle or for any mechanical default in the booked vehicle ; or claims against any similar issue faced by
either the host or the customer. Under the erstwhile business model of the Company , the Company had procured third-party insurance policies
for fleet under its management which indemnifies against personal death and/or injuries suffered either by the customer or third-parties
during the use of its vehicles. Based on the insurance coverage, the Company is confident that liability, if any, arising from the claims
under the previous business model will be covered by the insurance. Further, under the current business model of the Company, wherein
the Company acts only as a facilitator, any issues arising from breach of any terms including improper use of vehicles and/or physical
damages made to the vehicles or any mechanical issues in the vehicle will be the responsibility of either the host or the customer. While
uncertainties are inherent in the final outcome of these matters, the Company believes that the disposition of these proceedings will

further communication from the authorities. In relation to the GST demands on gross booking value, the Company has filed a writ petition

(D) On January 30, 2024, the Company received a statement of arbitration

The
following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in
conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and our audited consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as of and for the year
ended March 31, 2024 included in our Form 10-K/A. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Our actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences
include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the sections titled Risk Factors and Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included in this Form 10-Q. Additionally, our historical results are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected in any future period. Amounts are presented in U.S. dollars. 

Unless
the context otherwise requires, references in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations to Zoomcar, we , us , our , and the Company are
intended to refer to (i) following the Business Combination, the business and operations of Zoomcar Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated
subsidiaries, and (ii) prior to the Business Combination, Zoomcar, Inc. (the predecessor entity in existence prior to the consummation
of the Business Combination) and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Overview 

During
our fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, Zoomcar s business model shifted from a prior business model, in which we owned and leased
vehicles to our customers, to our current online peer-to-peer car sharing platform which connects Hosts (car owners) with Guests (persons
in temporary need of vehicles). Although our platform technology was already under development for several years prior to this transition
and we began on-boarding Hosts to our platform before the transition was complete, until our business model changed, most of our revenue
was derived from what we refer to as short-term car rentals and vehicle subscriptions, whereas, beginning
in December 2021, a shift in our business model occurred in connection with which facilitation revenues generated from
bookings on our marketplace platform began to represent an increasing proportion of our total revenues. 

As of November 8, 2024,
we had 2,060,344 shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding. Except as otherwise indicated, all share and per share information
in this report gives effect to a reverse stock split effected on October 21, 2024 at a ratio of 1-for-100. 

Standard
Booking Flow 

During
the six months ended September 30, 2024, we operated a peer-to-peer car sharing platform in emerging markets across three countries and
generated revenues from bookings by our Guests of vehicles listed on our Zoomcar platform by our Hosts. Zoomcar receives a portion of
the associated booking fee charged to the Guest (less any credits or discounts applied), as well as platform fees charged to Guests and
Hosts and trip protection fees (which we refer to as value-added fees charged to Guests. As further described below, other
fees charged to Guests, such as fuel charges, are paid fully to Hosts, who also receive a revenue share equal to approximately 60 of
booking fees and between 0 and 40 of certain other charges. We use our customized algorithm to price trips dynamically on the platform,
leveraging our data from the millions of miles driven on our platform to intelligently price the risks of trips and the market, incorporating
information about Guests informed by data we collect and Zoomcar management s professional experience. While Hosts can opt to offer
bookings at prices that are different from those the platform generates as recommendations, most Hosts tend to select the algorithmically
derived pricing for their bookings. The functionality enabled by our customized pricing tools is reflected in both Guest booking fees
and in the trip protection or value-added fees charged to Guests, who are presented with three algorithmically derived
trip protection pricing options from which to choose. The revenue- generating components of a trip booked on our peer-to-peer car sharing
platform include: 

Charges
 to Guests : For each booking on our platform, the aggregate amount we charge the Guest consists of the upfront booking fee,
 value-added fees, the Guest platform fees, and certain other charges (e.g., late fees, trip extension fees, etc.). We refer to these
 fees collectively as the gross booking value (GBV). The booking fee and trip protection fees are determined algorithmically
 by our system at the time of booking inception, while other fees may be charged during or after the trip, depending on events arising
 during the trip. Neither Zoomcar nor our Host subsidize fuel costs for Guests. Guests cover their own fuel costs, which are
 in addition to the booking fee. 

Charges
to Hosts : For each booking on our platform, we charge a revenue share to the Host based on a percentage of the booking
fee plus other fees that are transferable to the Host. The average revenue share that Zoomcar receives from a booking on our platform
is approximately 40 , with the Host retaining the remaining 60 . Our platform provides Hosts with a menu of incentives related to specific
factors such as bookings served and minimum host ratings. We charge Hosts minimum marketplace fees to offset the costs of our installed
devices.

Key
Business Metrics 

In
addition to the measures presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key business metrics
to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. We
are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating these key metrics, which may hinder comparability with other companies that may
calculate similarly titled metrics in a different way.

Booking
Days 

We
define Booking Days as total days (24 hours measured in minutes) that a vehicle is booked by Guests on our platform in
a given period, for trips ended, net of total days relating to cancelled bookings in that period. We believe Booking Days is a key business
metric to help investors and others understand and evaluate our results of operations in the same manner as our management team, as it
represents a standardized unit of transaction volume on our platform in any given time period. 

(1) Refers
to calendar quarters (i.e., Q2-21 = April 01 to June 30, 2021). 

For the three months ending
September 30, 2024, Booking Days on the platform totaled approximately 161,038, compared to 163,582 during the three ended September 30,
2023. 

For the six months ending
September 30, 2024, Booking Days on the platform totaled approximately 329,547compared to 346,159 during the six months ended September
30, 2023. 

During
the three months and six months ended September 30, 2024, we took several measures to shift our strategy from volume to profitability
and improve our unit profitability at the expense of booking days growth, which resulted in the lower sequential growth in Gross Booking
Value. However, this shift in strategy resulted in positive trends experienced in net revenue per booking and cost of revenue quarter
over quarter. 

57 

Gross
Booking Value 

We
define the Gross Booking Value, or GBV, as the total dollar value of Booking Days booked on our platform, including upfront booking fee
(less discounts and credits), value-added fees (i.e., trip protection fees), Guest and Host platform fees, and other charges. GBV includes
applicable pass-through taxes and other fees required to be remitted to local authorities, which are excluded from net revenue. GBV is
driven by the number of Booking Days and related trip pricing. Revenue from bookings is recognized ratably over the duration of the trip;
accordingly, we consider GBV a leading indicator of revenue. 

(1) Refers
to calendar quarters (i.e., Q2-21 = April 01 to June 30, 2021). 

(2) Booking
Days and GBV for bookings ended, excludes cancelled bookings. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, Gross Booking Value on the platform totaled approximately 6.12 million, compared to approximately
 6.75 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

During
the six months ended September 30, 2024, Gross Booking Value on the platform totaled approximately 12.35 million, compared to approximately
 14.01 million during the six months ended September 30, 2023. 

This
trend in GBV reflects the trend in Booking Days observed above owing to the several measures we took to shift our strategy from volume
to profitability and improve our unit profitability at the expense of booking days growth, which resulted in the lower sequential growth
in GBV. 

Components
of results of operations 

Net
revenue 

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we began offering a peer-to-peer car sharing platform, which enables Hosts to connect with Guests.
We act as an agent under this model and thus, our primary source of revenue is recording revenue from services (on a net basis) for those
trips fulfilled by Host vehicles. Prior to August 2021, vehicles available on our platform consisted solely of Company-owned or leased
vehicles that we offered for short-term rental or longer-term subscription. 

Our
revenue for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, consists of revenue from services and other operating
revenue. 

Revenue
from Services 

Support
and facilitation services offered by the Company include services like assistance in execution of a lease agreement, payment facilitation,
vehicle delivery, on-road assistance, prospective renter diligence and vehicle usage/location tracking (in cases of loss or theft). 

Revenue
from services consists of our share of GBV. The fees that are components of GBV are charged as a percentage of the value of certain components
of the gross booking value, excluding taxes. Our revenue from services consists of our share of the service fees charged to the Hosts,
net of incentives and refunds. We collect these fees from the Guest and share a portion of the booking fee and trip extension with the
Host post recovery of our share of facilitation revenue. Daily we, or our third-party payment processors, disburse a portion of the GBV
to the Hosts, less the fees due from the Host to us. The amounts charged for the booking fee vary based on factors such as the vehicle
type, the day of the week, time of the trip, and the duration of the trip. Revenue is recognized ratably over the trip period as we satisfy
our performance obligations. 

58 

We
also require our Guests to choose one of the three trip protection options. A per-trip amount (included in the booking fee) is charged
for trip protection, which is collected upon the booking. We recognize revenue from trip protection charges over the trip completion
period. 

Recorded
revenue from services is reduced by the portion of those incentives and credits paid to our Hosts and Guests that cannot be directly
attributable to distinct services performed by the Hosts and Guests. These incentives are treated as contra-revenue and reduce our net
Revenue recorded in each period. Those incentive costs that can be attributed to a distinct service (e.g., referral bonuses paid to referrer)
are included in sale and marketing expenses. 

Others 

We
exclude from revenue the taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on specific revenue- producing transactions and
collected from customers/subscribers. 

Cost
of Revenue 

Cost
of revenue primarily consists of, (1) personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams that provide phone, email
and chat support to users, (2) repair and maintenance expenses of vehicles, (3) payment gateway charges, (4) depreciation of devices
for keyless entry system and GPS which are installed in the vehicles of Hosts, (5) software support and maintenance, and (6) other direct
expenses. We expect that the cost of revenue will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future to the
extent that we continue to see growth on the platform. However, cost of revenue may vary as a percentage of revenue from period to period
based on activity on the platform. 

Technology
and Development 

Technology
and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses for technology, product, and engineering teams,
as well as expenses associated with our information technology and data science platforms. We expect that our technology and development
expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis but vary from period to period as a percentage of net revenue for the foreseeable
future as we continue to invest in technology and development activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform,
including the potential hiring of additional personnel to support these efforts. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expenses primarily consist of online marketing expenses, marketing promotion expense, marketing partnerships with third
parties, sales and marketing personnel compensation expenses and certain incentives and referral bonuses paid to Hosts (reflecting the
portion of incentive costs not adjusted against net revenue). Sales and marketing expenses also include allocated overhead. We expect
that our sales and marketing expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis but vary from period to period as a percentage of net
revenue for the foreseeable future. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses for executive management and administrative functions, including
finance and accounting, legal, and human resources. General and administrative expenses also include certain travel expenses, professional
service fees, including legal expenses, rent expenses, office expenses, repairs and maintenance of office equipment and furniture, directors 
and officers insurance and other expenses. We further expect to continue incurring general and administrative expenses of operating
as a public company, including expenses for insurance, costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed
on a Nasdaq, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, investor relations,
and professional services expenses. We expect general and administrative expenses will reduce on absolute dollar basis owing to our efforts
to manage costs. 

59 

Finance
Costs 

Finance
costs consist primarily of interest on vehicle loans, finance leases and redeemable promissory note. Costs recognized on account of change
in fair valuation of Senior Subordinated Convertible Promissory Notes, convertible promissory notes and derivative financial instruments
are included. In addition, it also includes Note issue expenses, bank charges, other borrowing costs. 

Other
(Income) and Expense, Net 

Other (income) and expense,
net consists primarily of change in fair value of the preferred stock warrant and the unsecured convertible note, interest income, (gain)/loss
on sale of assets assets held for sale, Loss on assets written off, loss on foreign currency transactions and balances, and other
expenses. 

Gain
on troubled debt restructuring 

Gain
on troubled debt restructuring includes the gain consists of gains on account of restructuring of loans from lenders and gains on account
of concluded negotiations with vendors for reduction in outstanding liabilities.

Our
total net revenue for the three months ended on September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, was 2.25 million and 2.68 million, respectively,
representing a decline of 0.43 million, or 16 . While the total number of Bookings increased by 7 , Booking Days and GBV declined by
2 and 9 respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus the previous comparable period. 

Our
total net revenue for the six months ended on September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, was 4.49 million and 5.30 million, respectively,
representing a decline of 0.81 million, or 15 . While the total number of Bookings increased by 8 , Booking Days and GBV declined by
5 and 12 respectively, during the six months ended September 30, 2024, versus the previous comparable period. 

In
the peer-to-peer car sharing model, we continued to take several measures to improve profitability, such as (i) reduction of cash incentives
paid to Hosts and (ii) introduction of cancellation fees for Host and Guest. These and other cost rationalization strategies resulted
in improved unit profitability at the expense of reducing booking days growth, resulting in lower Booking Days, GBV and Net revenue for
the three and six months ended on September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.

Cost of revenue was 1.21
million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.74 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023,
a decrease of 1.52 million, or 56 . This decrease was driven by overall Company-wide efforts to drive greater operational efficiency.
Key drivers of the cost savings include 0.66 million reduction of repair and maintenance cost by optimizing the network of third-party
vehicle garages, entering into new pricing contracts with these garages and reducing the accident rate by strengthening the Guest verification
process, 0.32 million reduction in personnel costs (driven by headcount reductions in India, and discontinuation of operations in Vietnam,
Egypt and Indonesia during the three months ending September 30, 2024), a decrease of 0.04 million of uncollected customer charges which
were paid to the Host by the Company as part of its business customary practice. Due to discontinuation of operations in Egypt, Indonesia
and Vietnam there was a savings of 0.06 million during the three months ended in September 2024 as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023, under other expenses. 

We
further achieved savings of 0.14 million for software support and maintenance charges due to optimization of cloud cost and google maps
services which were comparatively higher during the three months ending September 30, 2023, owing to the higher spending on brand marketing
which brought more customers on the platform, increased searches without any material impact on booking. Further, there were cost savings
of 0.14 million on account of depreciation on tracking devices during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to three
months ended September 30, 2023, since these devices were completely depreciated in the previous Fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. 

Cost
of revenue was 2.73 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6.35 million during six months ended
September 30, 2023, a decrease of 3.62 million, or 57 . This decrease was driven by overall Company-wide efforts to drive greater
operational efficiency. Key drivers of the cost savings include 0.89 million reduction in personnel costs (driven by headcount
reductions in India, and the closure operations in Vietnam, Egypt and Indonesia during the six months ending September 30, 2024 as
well as a 0.08 million decrease in ESOP related costs during the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to six months
ended September 30, 2023), a decrease of 0.52 million of uncollected customer charges which were paid to the Host by the Company as
part of its business customary practice. Due to discontinuation of operations in Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam there was a savings of
 0.12 million during the six months ended in September 2024 as compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 under other
expenses. Repair and maintenance charges were reduced by 1.22 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, by optimizing
network of third-party vehicle garages, entering new pricing contract with these garages, and reducing accident rate by
strengthening the Guest verification process. During the six months ended September 30, 2024 there is a savings of 0.36 million due
to introducing direct settlement of Toll charges between host and guest. 

We
further achieved savings of 0.34 million for software support and maintenance charges due to optimization of cloud cost and google maps
services which were comparatively higher during the six months ending September 30, 2023, owing to the higher spending on brand marketing

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

In
addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP financial measures help us to evaluate
our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. We use the following non-GAAP
financial measures, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. 

We
believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because they provide consistency
and comparability with past financial performance and assist in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP
financial measures to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes
only, should not be considered as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from
similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Because of these limitations, we consider, and you should consider,
our non-GAAP financial measures alongside other financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of
each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is provided below. Investors
are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most
directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Contribution
Profit (Loss) and Contribution Margin 

We
define contribution profit (loss) as our gross profit (loss) plus (a) depreciation expense included in cost of revenue, (b) stock-based
compensation expense included in cost of revenue, (c) other general costs included in cost of revenue (rent, software support, insurance,
travel); less (i) Host incentive payments and (ii) marketing and promotional expenses (excluding brand marketing). 

We
use contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin as indicators of the economic impact of a new booking on our platform, as they
capture the direct expenses attributable to a new booking on our platform and the cost required to generate revenue. While certain contribution
profit (loss) adjustments may not be non-recurring, non-cash, non-operating, or unusual, contribution profit (loss) is a metric our management
and board of directors find useful, and we believe investors may find useful in understanding the costs most directly associated with
our revenue-generating activities. 

We
recorded a contribution profit of 1.21 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus a contribution loss of 0.12
million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross profit improved to 1.03 million during the three months ended September
30, 2024, versus a gross loss of 0.06 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was driven by significant reductions
in cost of revenue due to the overall improvements in Companywide operational efficiencies accomplished over the past few quarters. In
addition, host incentives and marketing costs (excl. brand marketing) were reduced significantly to 0.05 million during the three months
ended September 30, 2024, versus 0.60 million during the same period in 2023, which further contributed to the Company achieving contribution
profit as compared to contribution loss in the previous comparable period. 

We
recorded a contribution profit of 1.67 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, versus a contribution loss of 1.29 million
during the six months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross profit improved to 1.76 million during the six months ended September 30,
2024, versus a gross loss of 1.05 million during the six months ended September 30, 2023, which was driven by significant reductions
in cost of revenue due to the overall improvements in Companywide operational efficiencies accomplished over the past few quarters. In
addition, host incentives and marketing costs (excl. brand marketing) were reduced significantly to 0.59 million during the six months
ended September 30, 2024, versus 1.48 million during the same period in 2023, which further contributed to the Company achieving contribution
profit as compared to contribution loss in the previous comparable period. 

Contribution
profit (loss) and contribution margin are non-GAAP financial measures with certain limitations regarding their usefulness; they should
be considered as supplemental in nature and are not meant as substitutes for gross profit /(loss) and gross margin, which are measures
prepared in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures, we utilize the GAAP financial measure
of gross profit (loss), which is defined as revenue minus cost of revenue, each of which is presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations. Our definitions of contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin may differ from the definitions used
by other companies in our industry and, therefore, comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or
other similar metrics. Further, our definition of contribution profit (loss) does not include the impact of certain expenses that are
reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Thus, our contribution profit (loss) should be considered
in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, gross profit (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted
EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income or loss adjusted for (i) provision for income taxes; (ii) other
income and (expense), net; (iii) depreciation and amortization; (iv) stock-based compensation expense; and (v) finance costs. 

We
use adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income or loss, its corresponding GAAP measure, as a performance measure that we use to assess
our operating performance and operating leverage in our business. The above items are excluded from our adjusted EBITDA measure because
these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, or they are not driven by core
results of operations, thereby rendering comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. 

We
believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the results of our operations,
as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we have included adjusted
EBITDA because it is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to analyzing
operating expenses, evaluating performance, and performing strategic planning and annual budgeting. 

Our
adjusted EBITDA loss has reduced to 1.47 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an adjusted EBITDA
loss of 3.87 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Our
adjusted EBITDA loss has reduced to 4.73 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss
of 10.67 million during the six months ended September 30, 2023. 

This
improvement is a result of broad-based cost reduction and optimization initiatives that reduced our cost of revenue, technology and development
costs, sales and marketing costs, and general and administrative costs (as described above) during the three and six months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 

67 

Adjusted
EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the
related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following: 

Adjusted
 EBITDA does not reflect other (income)/expense, net, which includes interest income on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash
 and investments, net of interest expense, and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and balances; 

Adjusted
 EBITDA excludes certain recurring non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible
 assets; although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may need to be replaced in the future, and
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 

Adjusted
 EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a recurring
 expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy: and 

Adjusted
 EBITDA excludes all finance charges. 

Because
of these limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our
other GAAP results.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

During
the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 respectively, we generated negative cash flows from operations of 2.50 million and
 10.21 million, respectively, reflecting greater operating cost efficiencies and reduced overhead expenditures in 2024. The Company incurred
a net loss of 3.35 million and 12.40 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and the accumulated
deficit amounts to 313.44 million and 311.19 million as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 0.61 million, consisting of cash on hand, fixed deposits and other bank
balances. 

Our
primary use of cash is to fund our existing operations. If we have sufficient working capital, we will continue to invest in product
development and in our technology platform. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will be reduced on an absolute dollar
basis due to our efforts to manage cost, use of our cash effectively and improve profitability while managing our research and development
programs. As on September 30, 2024, the Company s cash position was critically deficient and critical payments to the operational
and financial creditors of the Company are not being made in the ordinary course of business, all of which raises substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

In
October 2022, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (BCA) for merger with Innovative International Acquisition Corp. IOAC In October 2022, we entered into a note purchase agreement with Ananda small business trust, an affiliate of the SPAC sponsor. Ananda
small business trust has purchased notes worth 10.00 million. Additionally, pursuant to signing the BCA, the Company has entered into
a warrant and convertible note agreement in February 2023 with new investors and has raised a total of 21.28 million (before fees) as
of August 16, 2023 (which has converted at a discount in the deSPAC). On December 28, 2023, we completed our deSPAC transaction with
IOAC and received cash of 5.77 million, assumed liabilities amounting to 21.5 million and unsecured promissory notes of 3.26 million
were also assumed. 

On June 18, 2024, the Company
entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional accredited investors (the June Aegis Securities Purchase
Agreement pursuant to which the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 3.60 million in principal amount of notes (the June
Notes and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,267,728 shares (52,966,102 shares prior to Reverse Stock Split)
shares of Company Common Stock (the June Warrants for gross proceeds to the Company of 3.00 million. The June Notes are
due nine (9) months from the date of issuance, provided that the Company is required to use the proceeds at the closing date
of one or more subsequent equity, debt or other capital raise(s) or any sale of tangible or intangible assets with net proceeds sufficient
to repay all or any portion of the amounts due under the June Notes, and bear interest at a rate of 15 per annum (up to 20 per
annum during the occurrence of an Event of Default). The June Notes are also subject to optional redemption at the option of the Note
Holder in the event of a change of control or upon occurrence of an Event of Default (in which case the June Notes are redeemable at a
premium of 125 of the amount due thereunder). The June Notes contain certain negative covenants including, but not limited to, a
prohibition on incurring indebtedness (other than certain permitted indebtedness) or allowing or suffering to exist any liens or encumbrances
(other than permitted liens), repaying or redeeming any outstanding indebtedness other than the June Notes, redeeming or repurchasing
any equity interests of the Company, declaring any dividends or distributions, changing the Company s business, entering into any
related party transactions or issuing any securities that would cause a breach or default of the June Notes. The June Notes also contain
certain affirmative covenants, including, but not limited to, maintaining good standing, maintaining the Company s property and
intellectual property, maintaining current insurance policies and providing prompt notice in the event of an Event of Default or the commencement
of voluntary bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings. 

Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our growth, our ability to attract and retain
Hosts and Guests, and the scope of future sales and marketing activities. 

The Company expects to continue
to incur net losses and have significant cash outflows from operating activities for at least the next 12 months. Management has evaluated
the significance of the conditions described above in relation to the Company s ability to meet its obligations and concluded that,
without additional funding, the Company will not have sufficient funds to meet its obligations within one year from the date of the Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were issued. On November 5, 2024, the Company had entered into a private placement transaction
for gross proceeds of 9.15 million (before deduction of fees to the placement agent and other offering expenses). On November 7, 2024,
the Company closed on private placement financing pursuant to which it raised gross proceeds of approximately 9.15 million. After the
deduction of commissions and expenses, the Company received net proceeds of approximately 7.625 million and used 3.804 million of such
net proceeds to repay the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness relating to financing from institutional
investors in June 2024. There was also a holdback of 0.2 million for indemnification of the placement agent in the financing, leaving
proceeds of approximately 3.621 million to the Company. While this financing resulted in the payment of certain outstanding indebtedness,
the Company will still need to raise additional capital imminently in order to have sufficient capital. The Company believes that current
cash and cash equivalents will allow the Company to continue operations through December 31, 2024, assuming that the Company makes part
payments on its currently outstanding indebtedness and future accruals. The Company was advised by its largest investor and director that
he would no longer commit to continuing his support to the Company in the event that any liquidity requirements arise in the future. 

There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its business plan, raise any additional capital or secure the additional
financing necessary to implement its current operating plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
its ability to increase its revenues and eventually achieve profitable operations. No adjustments have been made to the financial statements
based on this uncertainty.

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 2.50 million and 10.21 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30,
2023, respectively. The major drivers contributing to the decrease of 7.72 million during the current six months compared to previous
six months period included the following: 

1. 
 Decrease in net loss of 35.30 million and including adjustments
for non-cash items contributed lower cash outflow of 29.41 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to six months ended September 30, 2023. These adjustments include fair value changes in financial instruments, SSCPN
issue expense, stock-based employee compensation, note issue expenses, gain on trouble restructuring, Interest expenses on redeemable
promissory note and finance leases, depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets and intangibles assets, among others. 

2. 
 Net increase in working
 capital of 1.83 million was a result of improved working capital management during the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
 to the six months ended September 30, 2023. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash generated from investing activities totaled 0.38 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to Net cash used
for investing activities totaled 0.07 million during the same period in 2023. The increase in cash generated during the six months ended
September 30, 2024, is largely attributable to receipt of proceeds from maturity of investment in fixed deposits during the current six
months as compared use of proceeds towards purchase of vehicle tracking devises and investment in fixed deposits during the six months
ended September 30,2023. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash generated from financing activities totaled 1.26 million and 10.60 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, and
September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company received proceeds from the issuance of redeemable promissory note amounting to 3.00 million,
 0.49 million paid in relation to note issuance expenses of redeemable promissory note and debt repayment of 1.25 million during
the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to higher proceeds from the issuance of Senior Subordinated convertible promissory
note of 13.18 million which was partly offset by note issuance cost, debt repayments and principal payment of finance lease obligations
totaled to 2.57 million, during the six months ended September 30, 2023. As the Company s cash position decreased, critical payments
and debt repayments were not being made in the ordinary course of business.

Contingencies 

The
Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for losses associated
with legal claims when such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted as additional information
becomes available or circumstances change. 

(A) Claims
filed by customers and third-parties not acknowledged as liability amounted to 4,259,794 and 4,565,949 as at September 30, 2024 and
March 31, 2024, respectively. The claims made by the customers against the Company includes claims that have been made for amounts charged
to customers by the Company as damages for improper use of vehicles and/or physical damages made to vehicles during an active trip ;
or claims made by customers for unavailability of the booked vehicle or for any mechanical default in the booked vehicle ; or claims
against any similar issue faced by either the host or the customer. Under the erstwhile business model of the Company , the Company had
procured third-party insurance policies for fleet under its management which indemnifies against personal death and/or injuries suffered
either by the customer or third-parties during the use of its vehicles. Based on the insurance coverage, the Company is confident that
liability, if any, arising from the claims under the previous business model will be covered by the insurance. Further, under the current
business model of the Company, wherein the Company acts only as a facilitator, any issues arising from breach of any terms including
improper use of vehicles and/or physical damages made to the vehicles or any mechanical issues in the vehicle will be the responsibility
of either the host or the customer. While uncertainties are inherent in the final outcome of these matters, the Company believes that
the disposition of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. 

(B) 
 The Company has received various orders from time to time from Indian
indirect tax authorities relating to disputes on input tax credits, service tax liabilities, GST dues, and taxability of car rental revenue
for periods between 2014 and 2023, totaling 8,013,164 (March 31, 2024: 7,984,418). These disputes include disallowance of input credits,
service tax liabilities on booking fees and penalty charges, disputes on goods and service tax input availed, and GST demands on gross
booking value. The Company has taken necessary steps, including filing appeals, submissions, and deposits, and is awaiting further communication
from the authorities. In relation to the GST demands on gross booking value, the Company has filed a writ petition with various authorities
challenging the order. Based on the submissions provided and documents available, management believes that no significant outflow is expected,
and therefore, no provision has been recorded as of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024. 

72 

(C) 
 In February
2023, a former employee of Zoomcar India instituted a suit before the City Civil and Sessions Judge at Mayo Hall, Bengaluru against Zoomcar
India, Zoomcar, Inc. and Zoomcar Holdings, Inc. (formerly IOAC) challenging his termination, claiming damages amounting to 405,059 and
claiming that 100,000 options to purchase shares of Zoomcar, Inc. have vested. On March 3, 2023, the City Civil and Sessions Judge at
Mayo Hall, Bengaluru, issued an interim injunction to restrain each of Zoomcar, Inc. and Zoomcar Holdings, Inc. from alienating
or dealing the 100,000 shares of Zoomcar, Inc. claimed by the former employee while the suit is pending. Zoomcar believes that
such claims are baseless and is attempting to have the interim order vacated. In addition, Zoomcar India filed an application in the
former employee s suit, seeking that Zoomcar Holdings, Inc. be deleted from the array of parties in the suit. 

(D) On January 30, 2024, the Company received a statement of arbitration
claims involving warrant holders seeking damages of at least 10,000,000 purportedly arising from the alleged breaches of certain agreements
between the Company and warrant holders. Additionally, the Claim requests additional amounts for attorneys fees and costs, as well
as an order of rescission regarding the issuance of certain allegedly wrongfully dilutive shares of the Company s stock issued in
connection with the business combination or, alternatively, an order mandating a purportedly anti-dilutive issuance of additional shares
of Zoomcar Common Stock to the warrant holders. The Court denied the temporary injunctive relief and passed an order to prevent issuance
of securities to insiders and allowing Claimants to attach Company s assets up to 3,500,000 if, and only if, located in New York.
No further action has been taken as JAMS arbitration panel is yet to be appointed. The claimants have filed a case in New York County
Supreme Court for seeking relief in aid of the arbitration claim to secure potential recovery. On June 18, 2024, the parties agreed to
defer all further action with respect to the arbitration and associated litigation until June 18, 2025. Zoomcar is examining its legal
options with respect to the Claim and the Court action. The Company believes that the claims are baseless and there was no breach of agreements
as alleged. 

(E) 

 In August 2022, the Company received a
complaint and a demand for trial by jury from Randall Yanker (complainant) towards non-payment of performance bonus consideration
seeking damages amounting to 15.9 million towards breach of contract claims, as well as costs, attorneys fees, and interest
on the 15.9 million amount. The Company believes the claims in the complaint are baseless and violative of the applicable law. The
Company had filed a motion to dismiss the case and out of the four course of actions sought by the complainant, the court has
dismissed the two course of actions and the other two are still pending the Court s consideration of the same. However, the Company
believes the likelihood of payment of above damages is possible. 
 
 The outcome of the above legal proceedings cannot be determined at
this time, and there can be no assurance as to the ultimate resolution of these matters or the potential impact on the
Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company will continue to monitor these proceedings
closely and provide updates as necessary in future disclosures. 

(F) The Company has received the notice from Nasdaq on November 6, 2024
stating that the Company has still not regained compliance with the Rule. Accordingly, its securities will be delisted from The Nasdaq
Global Market. In that regard, unless the Company requests an appeal of Staff s determination to a Hearings Panel, pursuant to the
procedures set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5800 Series, trading of the Company s Common Stock and warrants will be suspended
at the opening of business on November 15, 2024 and the Company s securities will be removed from listing and registration on The
Nasdaq Stock Market. Furthermore, on October 29, 2024, Staff notified the Company that it did not comply with Listing Rule 5450(b)(1)(B),
which requires that the Company s ordinary shares maintain a minimum of 1,100,000 publicly held shares for continued listing. This
matter serves as a separate and additional basis for delisting. The Company intends to timely request a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings
Panel. This hearing request will automatically stay Nasdaq s delisting of the Company s Common Stock and warrants pending
the Panel s decision and any extension provided by the Panel. The Company intends to present its plan of compliance, which may include
a transfer to the Nasdaq Capital Market listing tier. 

73 

(G) Zoomcar Holdings, Inc. files tax returns in the U.S. federal, various state, and foreign jurisdictions.
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by tax authorities. Our major tax jurisdiction is in India. The
Indian tax authority is currently examining our 2016 through 2022 tax returns. 

As at September 30, 2024,
tax returns for years ended March 31, 2020 and onward remain subject to examination by tax authorities in India. There are other ongoing
audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements. 

The Company received an order
for fiscal year 2015-16 in relation to non-deduction of tax deducted at source withholding taxes on certain payments to resident payees/service
providers amounting to 128,386 (March 31, 2024: 129,027). Penalty of 128,386 has been claimed but the proceedings are kept under abeyance
until the above order is disposed off. 

The Company has filed appeals
against the above orders before higher authority. 

The Company has not recognized any uncertain tax position as at September
30, 2024 and as at March 31, 2024, respectively. The Company believes these orders are unlikely to be sustained at the higher appellate
authorities. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
Company prepared its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and related disclosures at the date of
the financial statements, as well as revenue and expense recorded during the reporting periods. The Company evaluates our estimates and
judgments on an ongoing basis. 

The
Company bases its estimates on historical experience and/or other relevant assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from management s estimates. 

See
Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information
related to our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are as follows: 

Debt 

The debt instruments of the Company consist
of debentures and term loans from financial institutions. The Company based on available proceeds makes periodic prepayments of scheduled
instalments and the same has been accounted for under ASC 470-50. 

Redeemable Promissory Notes 

During the period ended September 30, 2024, the
Company has issued Redeemable Promissory Notes which are repayable at the principal value on maturity date and has been accounted for
under ASC 470-10. The Company issued these Redeemable Promissory notes on discount and incurred expenses on issue of the Redeemable Promissory
Notes. As per ASC 835, the discount and the expenses incurred on issue of the Redeemable Promissory Notes have been amortized over the
period of the Redeemable Promissory note on a straight-line basis. The Redeemable Promissory Notes liabilities have been presented net
off the discount and issue expenses. 

Debt Issuance costs 

Debt issuance costs consist primarily of arrangement
fees paid to Placement agent, professional fees and legal fees. These costs are netted off with the related debt and are being amortized
to interest expense over the term of the related. 

The debt has been classified into current or non-current
based on the payment terms of the debt instruments. Non-current obligations are those scheduled to mature beyond twelve months from the
date of the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

74 

Warrants 

When the Company issues warrants, it evaluates
the balance sheet classification of the warrant to determine whether the warrant should be classified as equity or as a derivative liability
on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In accordance with ASC 815- 40, Derivatives and Hedging- Contracts in the Entity s
Own Equity (ASC 815-40), the Company classifies a warrant as equity so long as it is indexed to the Company s equity 
and several specific conditions for equity classification are met. A warrant is not considered indexed to the Company s equity,
in general, when it contains certain types of exercise contingencies or adjustments to exercise price. If a warrant is not indexed to
the Company s equity or it has net cash settlement that results in the warrants to be accounted for under ASC 480, Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity, or ASC 815-40, it is classified as a derivative liability which is carried on the Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheets at fair value with any changes in its fair value recognized currently in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

Warrants issued along with Redeemable Promissory
Note: 

During the period ended September 30, 2024, the
Company issued warrants along with Redeemable Promissory Note and as consideration to placement agents for the issuance of the Redeemable
Promissory Note. 

These warrants were classified as equity in accordance
with ASC 815-40 since all the conditions required for equity classification are met. Upon issuance of the warrant, the Company had allocated
a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of its Redeemable Promissory Note to the warrant based on the relative fair values of warrants
and Redeemable Promissory Note in accordance with ASC 820. 

Warrants issued along with SSCPN and to placement
agent Derivative financial instrument ): 

During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company
issued warrants along with Senior Subordinated Convertible Promissory Note SSCPN) and as consideration to placement agents
for the issuance of SSCPN. 

These warrants were deemed derivative instruments
in accordance with ASC 815-10-15-83 since they contained an underlying, had cash less payment provisions, that could have been net settled
in shares and had a very minimal initial net investment. Accordingly, the derivatives were measured at fair value and subsequently revalued
at each reporting date until the close of Reverse Recapitalization consummated during year ended March 31, 2024. 

Warrants issued to preferred stockholders: 

Before the date of reverse
recapitalization, the Company had warrants issued to preferred stockholders convertible into Preferred Stocks and Common Stocks which
were issued during the year ended March 31, 2022, and were classified as liabilities and equity respectively. 

Each unit of Series E preferred
stock issued by the Company consisted of one Series E preferred stock and a warrant which entitled the holder to purchase one share of
Common Stock of the Company on the satisfaction of certain conditions. Warrants were also issued to placement agencies of the Series E
and Series E1 which included the following two categories: a) warrants to purchase Common Stock of the company; and b) warrants to purchase
Series E and Series E1 shares. 

Warrants to be converted into Common Stock: 

The Company s warrants
to purchase Common Stock were classified as equity. Upon issuance of the warrant, the Company had allocated a portion of the proceeds
from the issuance of its preferred stock to the warrant based on the relative fair values of warrants and preferred stock. 

Warrants to be converted into preferred stock Preferred stock warrant liability ): 

The Company s warrants to purchase convertible
preferred stock were classified as a liability and were held at fair value as the warrants were exercisable for contingently redeemable
preferred stock, which was classified outside of stockholders deficit. 

The warrant instruments classified as liabilities
were subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date, and any change in fair value was recognized as a component of finance costs. 

The Company continued to adjust the liability
classified warrant for changes in the fair value until the Reverse Recapitalization transaction at which time the warrants were reclassified
to additional paid-in-capital. 

75 

Financial
liabilities measured at fair value 

Convertible Promissory notes Notes ), Senior Subordinated
Convertible Promissory Note SSCPN and Unsecured Convertible Note Atalaya Note 

During the year ended March 31, 2024 the Company issued Notes and SSCPN.
The Company evaluated the balance sheet classification for these instruments either as liabilities or equity, and accounting for conversion
feature. As per ASC 480-10-25-14, the Notes and SSCPN were classified as liabilities because the Company intended to settle them by issuing
variable number of shares with a fixed and known monetary value at the time of inception. However, the Company had elected fair value
option for these Notes and SSCPN, as discussed below and thus did not bifurcate the embedded conversion feature. 

Fair Value Option FVO Election 

The Company accounted for Notes and SSCPN under the fair value option
election of ASC 825, Financial Instruments ASC-825 as discussed below. 

The Notes and SSCPN accounted under the FVO election which were debt
host financial instruments containing conversion features which otherwise would be required to be assessed for bifurcation from the debt-host
and recognized as separate derivative liabilities subject to measurements under ASC 815. Notwithstanding, ASC 825-10-15-4 provides for
the fair value option FVO election, to the extent not otherwise prohibited by ASC 825-10-15- 5, to be afforded
to financial instruments, wherein bifurcation of an embedded derivative is not necessary, and the financial instrument is initially measured
at its issue-date estimated fair value and then subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting
period date. 

The estimated fair value adjustment, as required by ASC 825-10-45-5,
was recognized as a component of other comprehensive income OCI with respect to the portion of the fair value adjustment
attributed to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk, with the remaining amount of the fair value adjustment recognized under
Finance costs shown as Change in fair value of Notes and Change in fair value of SSCPN in the accompanying
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. With respect to the above Notes and SSCPN, as provided for by ASC 825-10-50- 30(b), the
estimated fair value adjustments were presented as a separate line item in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations,
since the change in fair value of the Notes and SSCPN payable were not attributable to instrument specific credit risk. 

During the year ended March 31, 2024, as a result of consummation of
the Business Combination by way of Reverse Recapitalization, the Notes and SSCPN outstanding were converted into 59,757 shares (5,975,686
shares prior to the Reverse Stock Split) of the Company s Common Stock. 

The SSCPN and Notes were adjusted for their carrying value through
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as on date of Reverse Recapitalization and credited at carrying value to the capital accounts
upon conversion to reflect the stock issued. 

During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company
issued an unsecured convertible note Atalaya Note) which had features similar to that of SSCPN and were accounted accordingly
as enumerated above. 

Troubled debt restructuring 

As per ASC 470-60 Troubled Debt Restructuring
(TDR) refers to a situation where the creditor, grants concessions to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions
may include modifications to the terms of the payable, such as reducing the interest rate, extending the repayment period, or forgiving
a portion of the payable. Such restructuring is done with the intent to provide relief to the borrower and to maximize the potential for
payable recovery by the Company. 

In accordance with ASC 470-60, when the total
future cash payments under the new terms are less than the carrying amount of the payable at the date of restructuring, the difference
between the carrying amount and the total future cash payments is recognized as a Gain on Troubled Debt Restructuring in
the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. This gain is recorded immediately in the period the restructuring occurs. 

If the total future cash payments under the new terms exceed the carrying amount of the payable at the date of
restructuring, no adjustment to the carrying amount of the payable is made. Instead, the company calculates a New Effective Interest Rate
(EIR) based on the revised terms of the restructured payable. The debt is then amortized over the remaining life of the payable using
the new EIR, with interest expense recognized based on this rate in future periods. 

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in inflation and foreign currencies.
Such fluctuations to date have not been significant. 

76 

Foreign
Currency Exchange Risk 

We
transact business globally in multiple currencies, primarily Indian Rupees, U.S. Dollars, Singapore Dollars, Euros, Egyptian Pound, Vietnamese
Dong, and Indonesian Rupiah. Revenue as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating
expenses, along with certain intercompany transactions, denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily Indian Rupees.
Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. Dollars.
Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our entities that primarily recognize revenue in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar
incur expenses in the same underlying currencies and, as such, we do not believe that foreign currency exchange risk has had a material
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. A hypothetical 5 adverse change in the value of Indian Rupee in
relation to U.S. dollar, which is our single most significant foreign currency exposure, would have decreased total revenue and net loss
for the year ended March 31, 2024, by approximately 0.46 million and 1.04 million, respectively. We have experienced, and will continue
to experience, fluctuations in our net loss or income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasurement of our asset
and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.
These items are presented within other income (expense), net, in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

We
are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S.
Dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the translation adjustments resulting from the conversion
of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss), which is part of stockholders deficit.

4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the
end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting described below. In light of this fact, our management has performed additional analyses,
reconciliations, and other post-closing procedures and has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this quarterly
report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cashflows for the periods
presented in conformity with GAAP.

Material
 Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management s
Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management conducted, under the supervision
of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission, commonly referred to as the COSO criteria. Based on the assessment performed, as of June 30,
2024, we identified six material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to: 

(i) Our
controls were not adequately designed to properly monitor and document related party transactions. 

(ii) Our
controls over independent review and documentation of third-party specialists and advisors reports were not operating effectively.
We rely on third-party specialists for critical assessments, such as fair value measurements and preparation of key schedules and financial
statements. However, we failed to establish a consistent process for independently reviewing these third-party specialist and advisor
reports before incorporating them into our financial statements. 

(iii) Our
controls over financial reporting, specifically related to the inadequacy of our financial reporting policies and procedures, were not
operating effectively. The Company lacks financial reporting policies and procedures that are commensurate with GAAP and SEC reporting
requirements. 

(iv) Our
resources are deficient in comprehensive knowledge and expertise pertaining to technical accounting and SEC reporting requirements. 

(v) Our
controls over the financial statement close process do not provide sufficient evidence. 

(vi) Our
controls were not adequately designed to provide sufficient documentation and review of the operating effectiveness of Information Technology
General Controls ITGC for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of the Company s unaudited condensed
consolidated financials. Specifically, our user access controls were not adequately designed or implemented, our change management process
lacked rigor and documentation and our monitoring of ITGC controls was insufficient. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

We are taking actions to remediate the material
weaknesses relating to our internal control over financial reporting, as described above. Except as otherwise described herein, there
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d)
and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Remediation Plans 

We have commenced measures
to remediate the identified material weaknesses, including: 

(i) The
Company designed and implemented process for identification, monitoring and regulatory compliance of transactions involving related parties.
The Company s process includes rolling out related party transaction questionnaires quarterly to the identified related parties.
The management intends to continue to take steps and monitor the progress of the internal controls implemented. 

(ii) Significant
reduction in the number of complex financial instruments post the reverse recapitalization. The management actively engages with valuation
experts to communicate the underlying assumptions and terms of the financial instruments. The management intends to continue to monitor
the progress of the internal controls implemented. 

78 

(iii) Developing
financial reporting manuals including Standard Operating Procedures for financial statement closure process to ensure compliance with
US GAAP and SEC reporting requirements and monitoring controls over financial statement closure process. 

(iv) The Management
is working on hiring, training and retention of inhouse resources with requisite US GAAP knowledge. The management has also engaged external
accounting professionals and developing process for sufficient managements reviews. 

(v) The Management is
currently working on developing accounting manuals, policies and standard operating procedures in consultation with external consultants. 

(vi) The
management is in the process of developing ITGC policies and procedures to address identified deficiencies, ensuring controls are designed
and operating effectively. This will include establishing monitoring mechanisms to regularly evaluate and test the effectiveness of ITGC,
including access controls, change management, and data integrity validation. 

We intend to continue to take steps to remediate
the material weaknesses described above and further evolving our accounting processes. The actions we are taking are subject to ongoing
executive management review and are also subject to the oversight of the Audit Committee. We will not be able to fully remediate these
material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. If we are
unable to successfully remediate these material weaknesses, or if in the future, we identify further material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
may be materially misstated. 

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q does not
include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for
an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act of 2012. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness
of Controls 

Our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting
are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However,
management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or
detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because
of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II
- OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

Except
as described below, we are not currently subject to any material claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government
investigations and other legal and regulatory disputes and proceedings (collectively, Legal Proceedings and we are not
subject to any pending Legal Proceedings in any of the jurisdictions where we operate other than in India. We have received communications
relating to certain legal proceedings, as described in below under the title Risk Factors A former consultant
to Zoomcar has commenced a lawsuit against Zoomcar asserting that he is entitled to compensation in connection with prior Zoomcar transactions
and the Business Combination Risk Factors A former employee of Zoomcar India has instituted
a wrongful termination suit and claims that certain Zoomcar options have vested and Risk-Factor - The founder and
former CEO of the Company has initiated a civil complaint against the Company contesting the reasons for his termination and has raised
certain other claims with regards to his ownership of the Company and compensation for termination of his employment. We may
become subject to other Legal Proceedings over time or from time to time, in the ordinary course of our business and as our business
continues to grow and expand over time. Becoming involved with Legal Proceedings, regardless of the outcome, may result in substantial
cost and diversion of our resources, including our management s time and attention. 

As
a result of our business operations in India, we are regularly subject to legal proceedings, many of which are de minimis in nature and
amount and the majority of which relate to local tax matters. Many of these tax and vehicle accident-related Legal Proceedings are pending
before various forums in India and involve localized practices and interpretations of regulatory matters that make the ultimate outcomes
or resolution of these Legal Proceedings inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. Management s views and estimates related
to these matters may change in the future, as new events and circumstances arise and the matters continue to develop. 

i. On
August 4, 2023, a former consultant to Zoomcar filed a complaint against Zoomcar in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York. The complaint contains breach and anticipatory breach of contract claims arising from a letter agreement, effective
as of May 2020, between Zoomcar and the former consultant, which engagement letter was terminated by Zoomcar in January 2022. The plaintiff
alleges that the terms of the engagement letter entitle him to cash and warrants to purchase Zoomcar shares in relation to prior Zoomcar
transactions and upon consummation of the proposed Business Combination. The complaint seeks declaratory relief affirming the plaintiff s
alleged continuing right to receive compensation from Zoomcar under the engagement letter, together with attorneys fees, costs,
and interests, as well as punitive damages. A motion to dismiss filed by the Company has been denied vide the orders passed on October
9 and October 16, 2024. 

On
January 30, 2024, Zoomcar received a statement of arbitration claim (the Claim before Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
Services, Inc. JAMS ), with Aegis Capital Corp. Aegis ), Adam Stern, and the Robert J. Eide Pension Plan
being the claimants therein. The Claim alleges breaches of certain agreements between (a) Aegis and Zoomcar, and (b) Adam Stern and the
Robert J. Eide Pension Plan as warrant holders, on the one hand, and Zoomcar on the other; it seeks damages preliminarily believed
to be at least 10,000,000 purportedly arising from the alleged breaches, though the Claim does not set forth any basis for that
preliminary belief, additional amounts for attorneys fees and costs, as well as an order of rescission with respect to the issuance
of certain allegedly wrongfully dilutive shares of Zoomcar stock issued in connection with the business combination between Zoomcar and
Innovative International Acquisition Corp. or, alternatively, an order mandating a purportedly anti-dilutive issuance of additional shares
of Zoomcar Common Stock to the claimants. Zoomcar is examining its legal options with respect to the Claim. On January 31, 2024, the
Zoomcar claimants filed an action in the New York State Supreme Court, including an order to show cause seeking substantially the same
relief as the Claim on a declaratory basis along with temporary injunctive relief. The Court denied the temporary injunctive relief and
has scheduled a hearing on the order to show cause for February 21, 2024. Zoomcar is examining its legal options with respect to
the Claim and the Court action. The Company believes that the claims are baseless and there was no breach of agreements as alleged. Claimants
filed a separate order to show cause seeking attachment of the Company s assets arguing the Company did not have sufficient working
capital to satisfy a potential award based on its public filings. The Court found that while Claimants had not shown a likelihood of
success on their theory of the case, it was likely something would be owed. An order, granting claimants the right to attach up to 3,399,878
of Zoomcar s assets in New York along with other relief, was issued and later modified by the New York Appellate Division, First
Department. A motion seeking to stay or modify that order is currently pending in the First Department and the parties are awaiting the
start of arbitration. On June 18, 2024, in connection with the Company s agreement to engage Aegis as placement agent as
mentioned under Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations. The parties have thereafter agreed to defer all further action with respect to the arbitration and associated
litigation until June 18, 2025. 

In February 2023, a former
employee of Zoomcar India instituted a suit before the City Civil and Sessions Judge at Mayo Hall, Bengaluru against Zoomcar India, Zoomcar
and IOAC challenging his termination, claiming approximately 400,000 in damages, and claiming that 100,000 options to purchase shares
of Zoomcar have vested. On March 3, 2023, the City Civil and Sessions Judge at Mayo Hall, Bengaluru, issued an interim injunction to restrain
each of Zoomcar and IOAC from alienating or dealing the 100,000 shares, on pre-split basis, of Zoomcar claimed by the former
employee while the suit is pending. Zoomcar believes that such claims are baseless and is attempting to have the interim order vacated.
In addition, Zoomcar India filed an application in the former employee s suit, seeking that IOAC be deleted from the array of parties
in the suit, inter alia since (i) IOAC is neither a necessary nor a proper party to the suit; (ii) no reliefs have been sought by the
former employee from IOAC; and (iii) there is no cause of action against IOAC. 

On
September 26, 2024, we received a copy of a complaint filed with the United States District Court for the District of Delaware wherein
our founder and former CEO Mr. Moran has challenged the Company s termination of his employment for cause, effective as of June
18, 2024,. Mr. Moran has contested the facts leading up to the grounds on which his termination was based and has also claimed that this
alleged wrongful termination has also deprived him of his vested right to 8 of the Company s outstanding equity that he claims
was owed to him under his Employment Agreement. He has also claimed that in connection with his termination he is entitled to the payment
of certain amounts for unused paid leave during his employment with Zoomcar, along with certain bonuses he claims to be owed under the
terms of his Employment Agreement, as well as severance equal to one year s base salary. Zoomcar believes that the Mr. Moran s
employment, for cause, was properly terminated in accordance with the terms of his Employment Agreement As of October 31, 2024, the suit
has been dismissed on account of Mr. Moran s intention to refile the case in Delaware Superior Court.

1A. Risk Factors 

An
investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an
investment decision. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well
as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. The trading price of our securities could decline
due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment. 

In
the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks. Any of the risk factors we describe below have
affected or could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The market price of our securities
could decline, possibly significantly or permanently, if one or more of these risks and uncertainties occur. Certain statements in Risk
Factors are forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 

Risk
Factors Summary 

Our
business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section entitled Risk Factors 
immediately following this risk factors summary, which represent challenges that we face in connection with the successful implementation
of our strategy and the growth of our business. In particular, the following considerations, among others, may offset our competitive
strengths or have a negative effect on our business strategy, which could cause a decline in the price of shares of our Common Stock
or Public Warrants and result in a loss of all or a portion of your investment: 

Our current business model s
 limited operating history and financial results make our future results, prospects, and the risks we may encounter difficult to predict. 

We have a history of operating
 losses and negative cash flow, we have limited cash resources, we will need to raise additional funds to finance operations and as
 a result there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern; 

Certain of our debt financing
 arrangements are currently in default and we have delayed certain other payments to lenders, which may restrict our current and future
 business and operations; 

Our operating and financial
 forecasts are subject to various known and unknown contingencies and factors outside of our control and may not prove accurate, and
 we may not achieve results consistent with management s expectations; 

Various factors, some of
 which are outside of our control, which may adversely affect our business operations, our competitive standing, and the market price
 of our Common Stock; 

If we do not retain existing
 Hosts, or attract and maintain new Hosts, or if Hosts fail to provide an adequate supply of high-quality vehicles, our business,
 financial condition, and results of operations may be negatively impacted; 

If we fail to retain existing
 Guests, or attract and maintain new Guests, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be negatively impacted; 

If we are unable to introduce
 new or upgraded platform features that Hosts or Guests recognize as valuable, we may fail to retain and attract such users to our
 platform and our operating results would be adversely affected; 

81 

The market for online platforms
 for peer-to-peer car sharing is relatively new, competitive, and rapidly evolving. If we fail to successfully adapt to developments
 in our market, or if peer-to-peer car sharing online platforms do not achieve general acceptance, it could adversely affect our business,
 financial condition, and operating results; 

We require additional capital
 to support current operations and will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, which may not be available
 on terms acceptable to us, or at all; 

Our success depends upon
 our ability to maintain favorable customer reviews and ratings, and if our reputation suffers, our business, financial condition
 and operating results may be adversely affected; 

Maintaining and enhancing
 our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. While we have taken significant steps to build and improve our brand
 and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer; 

Breaches and other types
 of security incidents of our networks or systems, or those of our third-party service providers, could negatively impact our business,
 our brand and reputation, our ability to retain existing Hosts and Guests and attract new Hosts and Guests, may cause us to incur
 significant liabilities and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects. 

Our business depends on
 attracting and retaining capable management, technology development and operating personnel; 

We may be exposed to risk
 if we cannot enhance, maintain, and adhere to our internal controls and procedures; 

We are in the process of
 remediating identified material weaknesses in our internal controls and if we fail to remediate these weaknesses or otherwise fail
 to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to accurately
 or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, or comply with the accounting and reporting requirements applicable
 to public companies; 

Geographic areas in which
 Zoomcar operates and plans to operate in the future have been and may continue to be subject to political and economic instability,
 and certain laws and regulations in the Indian jurisdiction where Zoomcar operates are currently evolving; 

We may incur liability
 for the activities of Hosts or Guests which could harm our reputation, increase our operating costs, and adversely affect our business,
 financial condition, and operating results. ; 

Our business operations
 may result in losses for which we are not insured; 

The requirements of being
 a public company may strain our resources, divert our management s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain
 qualified independent board members; 

We are the subject of litigation
 and may not have the ability or the cash to successfully defend such litigation that has been and may in the future be brought against
 us; 

There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq ; 

We are an emerging
 growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and, if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements
 available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors; 

82 

Future
sales of our securities may affect the market price of the Common Stock and result in material dilution, including triggering the most
favored nation features of our Convertible Notes and the anti-dilution protection in the warrants issued in 2024. 

We are also in default of various outstanding debt obligations, including under the Notes issued to ACM, and may issue shares of Common Stock or other securities to satisfy those obligations in the future (in the case of ACM, subject to receipt of shareholder approval). The issuance of shares of Common Stock or other securities in the future will dilute your percentage ownership interest and may also result in downward pressure on the price of our Common Stock; 

We have issued a significant number of options and warrants and exercise of these securities and the sale of the shares of Common Stock issuable thereunder (along with the issuance of any similar securities in the future)will dilute your percentage ownership interest and may also result in downward pressure on the price of our Common Stock; 

Future sales , or the perception
 of future sales, by us or our stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for the Common Stock to decline; 

Uncertain global macro-economic
 and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition; and 

Natural disasters, including
 and not limited to unusual weather conditions, epidemic outbreaks, terrorist acts and political events could disrupt our business
 schedule. 

Risks
related to our Business and Operations 

Our
current business model s limited operating history and financial results make our future results, prospects and the risks we may
encounter difficult to predict. 

Although
Zoomcar commenced operating in 2013, we have recently transitioned from a prior business model to our current business model, consisting
of our asset-light online platform for peer-to-peer car sharing. As a result of this transition, certain components of our financial
statements have experienced variation, and our operating history may not be indicative of our future growth or financial results. The
limited history of our current business model makes predicting our future operating and other results difficult, if not impossible, and
there is no assurance that we will be able to grow our revenues in future periods. Our results of operations are impacted by a number
of factors, some of which are beyond our control, and we may suffer adverse impacts to our further development as a result of circumstances
which include decreasing customer demand, increasing competition, declining growth of the car sharing industry in general, insufficient
supply of vehicles on our platform, or changes in government policies or general economic conditions. We will continue to develop and
improve the features, functions, technologies and other offerings on our platform to increase our Guest and Host bases and volume of
bookings on our platform. However, the execution of our business plan is subject to uncertainty and bookings may not grow at the rate
we expect. If our growth rates decline, investors perceptions of our business and prospects may be adversely affected and the
market price of our Common Stock could decline. 

Existing
and potential holders of our securities should also consider the risks and uncertainties that a company with a limited history, such
as ours, will face in the evolving personal mobility solutions market. In particular, there can be no assurance that we will: 

successfully execute on
 our business plan, particularly in light of our current liquidity and capital resources; 

facilitate sufficient bookings
 to become profitable in the near-term if at all; 

attract increasing numbers
 of Hosts and Guests within our current market and future potential additional markets; 

increase penetration within
 our current markets through continued improvements in vehicle density, platform features and strategic marketing efforts; 

enable us to successfully
 execute our business plans; 

enhance our brand recognition
 and awareness; 

acquire new Hosts and Guests
 by increasing our market penetration with deeper market coverage; 

develop new platform functionality
 and features that enhance our ability to retain Guests and Hosts; 

develop, improve or innovate
 our proprietary technology that allows for a sustainable competitive advantage; 

attract, retain, and manage
 a sufficient staff of management and technology personnel; or 

respond effectively to
 competitive pressures. 

83 

We
have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow, we have limited cash resources, we will need to raise additional funds imminently
to finance operations and as a result there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We have a history of operating
losses and expect to continue incurring operating losses in the foreseeable future as we continue to develop our current business model
and enhance our platform offerings. We also have indebtedness that is in default in excess of our current capital resources (see Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources ). On June
18, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional accredited investors (the June Aegis
Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 3,600,000 in principal amount of
notes (the June Notes and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,267,728 shares (2,648,306 shares prior to the Reverse
Stock Split) of Company Common Stock (which takes into account an adjustment following the Company s Share Combination
Event that was effective on October 22, 2024 assuming that the June Warrants are adjusted down to the Floor Price) (the June
Warrants for gross proceeds of 3,000,000. 

Further, on November 5, 2024, the Company had entered into a private
placement transaction for gross proceeds of 9.15 million (before deduction of fees to the placement agent and other offering expenses
payable by the Company). Aegis Capital Corp. is acting as the Exclusive Placement Agent for the private placement pursuant to which the
Company agreed to sell to such Investors an aggregate of 2,137,850 units at a price of 4.28 per unit for an aggregate investment of 9.15
million, 2.50 million of which was provided by one of the Company s directors. Each unit consists of one share of the Company s
Common Stock, par value 0.0001 per share Common Stock ), two Series A Warrants each to purchase one share of Common Stock
(the Series A Warrants and a Series B Warrant to purchase such number of shares of Common Stock, as determined on the Reset
Date. The closing occurred on November 7, 2024 (the Closing Date ). On the Closing Date, the Company issued to the Investors
1,302,850 shares of Common Stock and Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase 835,000 shares of Common Stock. Purchasers of Pre-Funded Warrants
paid the per unit price of 4.28 less 0.0001 for each Pre-Funded Warrant purchased. Thereafter, upon closing of this private placement
transaction, the Company has received 3.62 million of cash and cash equivalents after giving effect to the payment to the Redeemable
Promissory Note Holders, offering fees and expenses. The Company believes that current cash and cash equivalents will allow the Company
to continue operations through December 31,2024, assuming that the Company makes part payments on its currently outstanding indebtedness
and future accruals, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Even if our current cash position supports operations through
the end of December 2024, we cannot assure that this cash will be sufficient in the longer run or that we will not be required to obtain
a further infusion of cash funds to support our operations or address the indebtedness. The Company as of date of this filing has 4.18
million of cash and cash equivalents. 

The
Company is still seeking potential financing for the purpose of raising additional funds to be able to meet its obligations and so that
there will no longer be substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. However, there is no assurance that the Company
will be able to raise any such financing or, even if it does, that it will be sufficient for it to meet its obligations or continue as
a going concern. 

Accordingly,
we believe that additional funds will be imminently required to support current operations and, in the long term, the growth of our business.
Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash, and we have incurred operating losses since we began operating in 2013. While
our cash consumption has been reduced following our business transition from short-term rental of vehicles owned by or leased to Zoomcar
to an online platform for peer-to-peer car sharing, we have consumed significant amounts of cash in effecting such transition in terms
of technology and platform innovation, and our cash consumption has varied over time. Our cash needs will depend on numerous factors,
including our revenues, upgrade and innovation of our peer-to-peer car sharing platform, customer and market acceptance and use of our
platform, and our ability to reduce and control costs. We expect to devote substantial capital resources to, among other things, fund
operations, continued improvement, upgrading or innovation of our platform, and expand our international outreach. If we are unable to
secure such additional financing, it will have a material adverse effect on our business, and we may have to limit operations in a manner
inconsistent with our development. 

84 

Our
operating and financial forecasts are subject to various known and unknown contingencies and factors outside of our control and may not
prove accurate, and we may not achieve results consistent with management s expectations. 

Our
quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. During any given period,
our operating and financial results may be influenced by numerous factors, many of which are unpredictable or are outside of our control.
Additionally, our limited operating history with our current peer-to-peer car sharing business model makes it difficult for us to forecast
our future results and subjects us to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and anticipate future growth. As a
result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly and annual operating results as indicators of future performance. We have encountered,
and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly evolving markets, such
as the risks and uncertainties described herein. 

The
market for online platforms for peer-to-peer car sharing is relatively new and rapidly evolving. If we fail to successfully adapt to
developments in our market, or if peer-to-peer car sharing online platforms do not achieve general acceptance, it could adversely affect
our business, financial condition and operating results. 

In
December 2021, we transitioned to our current peer-to-peer cash sharing business model. The market for online peer-to-peer car sharing
platforms is relatively new and unproven and the data and research available regarding the market or the industry may be limited and
unreliable. It is uncertain whether the peer-to-peer car sharing market will continue to develop or if our platform will achieve and
sustain a level of demand and market acceptance sufficient for us to generate meaningful revenue, net income, and cash flow. Our success
will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of Hosts and Guests to use our platform to identify car sharing opportunities.
Some Hosts may be reluctant or unwilling to make their vehicles available for use on our platform because of concerns which may include,
but are not limited to, potential decline in the value of their vehicle if listed on our platform, uncertainty of economic benefits from
platform usage, ability to recover losses associated with lost or damaged property, compliance with our platform s terms of use,
data privacy and security concerns, or other reasons. 

In
addition, our success also requires utilization of our platform by Guests to book vehicles. Guests willingness to utilize our
platform may depend, among other factors, on Guests belief in the ease-of use, integrity, quality, availability, safety, cost-effectiveness,
convenience and reliability of our platform and the vehicles listed by Hosts for bookings thereon. Any shift in Guest preferences in
the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, Guests may be reluctant or unwilling
to use a platform requiring Guests to provide personally identifiable information, payment information and driver s license details,
or have their driving behaviors monitored during bookings. Further, Guests may be reluctant to book vehicles containing GPS-enabled tracking
or monitoring devices accessible by Zoomcar, or to use our platform at all due to the perception of the use of such devices. 

85 

If
we do not retain existing Hosts, or attract and maintain new Hosts, or if Hosts fail to provide an adequate supply of high-quality vehicles,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be negatively impacted. 

Our
success in a given geographic market depends on our ability to establish and grow the scale of our platform in that market by attracting
Hosts and Guests to our platform. We depend upon having Hosts register high quality vehicles on our platform, maintain the safety and
cleanliness of their vehicles, and ensure that the descriptions and availability of their vehicles on our platform are accurate and up
to date. These practices are beyond our direct control and the number of vehicles shared by Hosts and resulting bookings options available
to Guests on our platform may decline based on a number of factors including, among other things, public health and safety concerns,
including pandemics/epidemics; economic, social, and political factors; state laws and regulations regarding car sharing, or the absence
of such laws and regulations, challenges obtaining, insuring, financing and servicing vehicles to list on the platform, some of which
may be exacerbated by infrastructure challenges in the emerging market where we operate our business. If Hosts register and offer fewer
high-quality vehicles to Guests on our platform, our bookings and revenues may decline, and our results of operations could be materially
adversely affected. Further, if Hosts with available vehicles choose not to offer their vehicles through our platform because competitive
car sharing platforms emerge that Hosts find more attractive than our platform, Hosts may be unwilling to continue registering vehicles
or making them available for bookings through the platform. For example, Hosts may cease or reduce vehicle registrations or the periods
of time they make cars available for bookings for any number of reasons, such as competitor platforms having more Guests making bookings,
risk of vehicle damage for which Hosts may not be able to recoup damages from Zoomcar or for any other reason, we may lack sufficient
supply of vehicles to attract Guests to utilize our platform. If Hosts do not share sufficient numbers of vehicles, or if the vehicles
they register to our platform are less attractive to Guests than vehicles offered by competitors, our revenue would likely decline and
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 

Hosts
are not required to make their vehicles available on our platform for a minimum sharing period or number of bookings and Hosts may choose
not to share their vehicles on our platform at all if we cannot generate sufficient demand for their vehicles or if bookings through
our platform are not sufficiently attractive to Hosts to retain and attract Hosts to use the platform. While we continue to invest in
tools and resources and curate add-on services to support Hosts, the pricing features and other capabilities of our platform may not
be as attractive to Hosts as those developed by our competitors, and Hosts may not share their vehicles on our platform as a result.
If Hosts perceive that listing vehicles on our platform may be insufficiently remunerative to, for example, offset any leasing, financing,
parking, registration, maintenance, and repair costs of vehicles registered to the platform, we may lose or fail to attract Hosts and
may not be able to make a sufficient number of vehicles available for use by our Guests. 

If
we fail to retain existing Guests, or attract and maintain new Guests, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may
be negatively impacted. 

Our
business model depends on our ability to retain and attract Guests to make bookings on our platform. There are a number of trends in
and aspects of Guest preferences which have an impact on us and the car sharing industry as a whole. These include, among others, preferences
for types of vehicles, convenience of online bookings, and monetary savings associated with car sharing and platform bookings relative
to other possible transportation solutions. Any shift in Guest preferences, which are susceptible to change, in the markets in which
we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, if the vehicles registered to our platform are not popular
or of sufficient quality or are not available at locations convenient for Guests, Guests may lose interest in utilizing our platform.
Additionally, if Guests find our platform not to be user-friendly or to lack functions that Guests expect from a car sharing or other
online platform, Guests may decrease or stop using our platform. Our competitiveness therefore depends on our ability to predict and
quickly adapt to Guest trends, exploiting profitable opportunities for platform development, innovation and upgrades without alienating
our existing Guest base or focusing excessive resources or attention on unprofitable or short-lived trends. If we are unable to respond
on a timely and appropriate basis to changes in demand or Guest preferences, our business may be adversely affected. 

86 

Additionally,
if we are unable to compete with other car sharing platforms and other mobility solutions in the markets in which we operate, our bookings
will decrease, and our financial results will be adversely affected. Guests desiring to book vehicles through our platform must pay booking
fees, which include, among other fees, upfront booking fees, less any applicable discounts and credits, and value
added or trip-protection fees payable at the time of a booking; other charges may also be incurred by Guests after a booking,
such as trip cancellation fees, gasoline fees, late fees and other charges. Many of these fees are generated through our platform functions
and some of the fees are selected by Guests from a range of options presented to them at the time of a booking. If our booking and trip-related
fees are not competitive, or our platform functionality is not appealing or outdated, or negative reviews or publications are released
in connection with our platform, Guests may stop or reduce their use of our platform, our business, results of operations, reputation,
and financial condition may be adversely affected. 

If
we are unable to introduce new or upgraded platform features that Hosts or Guests recognize as valuable, we may fail to retain and attract
such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected. 

To
continue to retain and attract Hosts and Guests to our platform, we will need to continue to introduce new or upgraded features, functions
and technologies that add value for Hosts and Guests that differentiate us from our competitors. Developing and delivering these new
or upgraded features, functions and technologies is costly, and the success of such features, functions and technologies depends on several
factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such features, functions and technologies. Moreover,
any such new or upgraded features, functions and technologies may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to Hosts and
Guests. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded features, functions and technologies, or if Hosts and Guests do not perceive
value in such new or upgraded features, functions and technologies, Hosts and Guests may choose not to use our platform, which would
adversely affect our operating results. 

We
have made substantial investments to develop new or upgraded features, functions and technologies, and we intend to continue investing
significant resources in developing new technologies, tools, features, services and other platform offerings. If we are unable to attract/retain
and pay qualified technical staff required to continue our platform feature development efforts, we may not realize the expected benefits
of our developments. 

There
can be no assurance that the new developments will exist or be sustained at the levels that we expect, or that any of these new developments
will gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate enough revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with
these new investments. Our development efforts with respect to new features, functions and technologies on our platform could distract
management from current operations and will divert capital and other resources from our more established functions and technologies.
Even if we are successful in developing new features, functions or technologies, or otherwise update or upgrade our platform, regulatory
authorities may subject us to new rules or restrictions in response to our innovations that could increase our expenses or prevent us
from successfully commercializing the new features, functions, technologies, updates or upgrades of our platform. If we are unable to
adapt in a cost-effective and timely manner in response to the changing market conditions or platform users preferences, either
for technical, legal, financial or other reasons, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely
affected. 

We
require additional capital to support current operations and will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, which
may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

To
continue current operations, we will need to raise capital imminently. Further, to continue to effectively compete thereafter, we will
require additional funds to support the growth of our business. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash, and we have
incurred operating losses since we began operating in 2013. While our cash consumption has been reduced following our business transition
from short-term rental of vehicles owned by or leased to Zoomcar to an online platform for peer-to-peer car sharing, we have consumed
significant amounts of cash in effecting such transition in terms of technology and platform innovation, and our cash consumption has
varied over time. 

87 

Further,
as a result of the consummation of the Business Combination, our expenses continue to increase substantially in connection with the actions
and efforts we need to take for operating as a public company. Moreover, we expect our expenses to increase significantly in connection
with our ongoing activities, including the continuing increase in our technological capabilities with respect to IoT, machine learning,
and artificial intelligence. We do not currently have sufficient cash resources to operate our business beyond December 2024 (assuming
that we do not repay any of our outstanding indebtedness) and accordingly, will need to raise capital imminently to continue our operations
and to fully execute our business plan. Additionally, circumstances could cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently
anticipate and if our cash resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to issue additional equity or debt
securities or obtain new or expanded credit facilities or identify and secure additional sources of capital. Our ability to obtain external
financing in the future is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including our future financial condition, results of operations, cash
flows, share price performance, liquidity of capital and lending markets and governmental regulations in India. In addition, incurring
indebtedness would subject us to increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would
restrict our operations. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in a timely manner or in amounts or on terms acceptable
to us, or at all. Any failure to raise needed funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will severely restrict our liquidity as well
as have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any issuance of equity
or equity-linked securities could result in significant dilution to our existing shareholders. Additionally, fundraising efforts may
divert our management from its day-to-day duties and activities, which may affect our ability to execute our business plan. If we do
not raise additional capital imminently to continue operations in the short term or otherwise when required or in sufficient amounts
and on acceptable terms, we may need to: 

significantly delay, scale
 back or discontinue certain business initiatives, such as our international expansion; 

significantly delay key
 investments in IoT, advanced computer vision, machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology; or 

significantly delay our
 consumer brand-building initiatives, thereby delaying our broader expansion. 

Our
future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, depend on many factors, including but not limited to: 

our ability to successfully
 scale our business within the market in which we currently operate, including by increasing the number and quality of Host vehicles
 and attracting and retaining more Guests to use our platform to meet a broader variety of mobility needs; 

our ability to successfully
 expand into additional emerging markets as opportunities to grow our operations become available to us; 

the pace of technological
 development in core focus areas such as IoT, computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence; 

the cost to establish,
 maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we
 may be required to make in preparing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any intellectual property rights; 

the effect of competing
 technological and market developments; and 

market acceptance of our
 platform and the functionality it provides to facilitate peer-to-peer car sharing. 

88 

If
lack of available capital prevents us from proceeding with the execution of our business plan, our ability to become profitable will
be compromised and our business will be materially affected. 

Future sales of our securities may affect
the market price of the Common Stock and result in material dilution, including triggering the most favored nation features of our Convertible
Notes and the anti-dilution protection in the warrants issued in 2024. We are also in default of various outstanding debt obligations,
including under the Notes issued to ACM, and may issue shares of Common Stock or other securities to satisfy those obligations in the
future (in the case of ACM, subject to receipt of shareholder approval). The issuance of shares of Common Stock or other securities in
the future will dilute your percentage ownership interest and may also result in downward pressure on the price of our Common Stock. 

We will finance our immediate
cash needs (and expect to finance our future cash needs until we become profitable, if ever) through equity offerings, debt financings
or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements.
We will require substantial funding to fund our business. Investors in the Zoomcar 2023 Private Financing Financing Investors received most favored nation exchange right provisions (the MFN Noteholder Rights with respect to their convertible
notes Convertible Notes ), and such provisions may have survived the Closing. Additionally, in June 2024 we issued
warrants that contain an alternative cashless exercise provision which gives the warrant holder the right to exchange the
warrant on a one-for-one basis for shares of Common Stock at any time that the warrant is exercisable without any cash payment and without
regard to the then market price of the Company s Common Stock or exercise price of the warrant. In addition, the warrants include
a provision that resets the warrant exercise price with a proportionate adjustment to the number of shares underlying the warrant in the
event of a reverse split of the Company s Common Stock at any time between the issuance date and the three-year anniversary of the
issuance date (a Share Combination Event ). In the event of a Share Combination Event, the exercise price of the warrant
will be reset to a price equal to the lesser of (i) the then exercise price and (ii) the lowest volume weighted average price
(VWAP) during the period commencing five trading days immediately after the date the Company effects a reverse stock split, subject to
a floor price of 2.832(as maybe adjusted in the future for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar
transaction, the Floor Price ). The warrants are also subject to full ratchet anti-dilution protection for any issuances
of Company securities (other than certain excluded issuances) at a price or effective price (as determined in accordance with the terms
of the warrant, the Dilutive Issuance Price that is less than the then current exercise price of the warrants following
the issuance date (a Dilutive Issuance ). In the event of a Dilutive Issuance, the exercise price of the warrants
will be reduced to the lower of the Dilutive Issuance Price and the lowest VWAP during the five consecutive trading days commencing after
the date of the Dilutive Issuance, in each case, subject to the Floor Price, and there will be a proportionate adjustment to the number
of shares underlying the warrant. In connection with the Business Combination, we also issued the Notes to ACM in satisfaction of certain
transaction expenses associated with the Business Combination. The Notes contain price based anti-dilution protection on the conversion
price of such Notes down to a floor price of 0.25 per share which has already been reached. While the Notes have already converted into
the maximum number of shares permissible under the terms of the Notes without receiving stockholder approval, we may seek stockholder
approval in the future to allow for the Notes to convert into additional shares. To the extent that we raise additional capital through
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, the MFN Noteholder Rights and anti-dilution
provision may be triggered, and the terms of the newly issued securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect
your rights. 

Any future adjustments to
the exercise price of the warrants (or additional issuances to make the Financing Investors whole) may have a negative impact on the trading
price of our Common Stock. Additionally, raising additional capital with new investors may be difficult as a result of the MFN Noteholder
Rights and anti-dilution protection. Sales of substantial amounts of Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales
could occur, could materially adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your
securities at a time and price which you deem appropriate. 

In
addition to our defaults under current indebtedness described elsewhere here, certain of our debt financing arrangements are currently
in default and we have delayed certain other payments to lenders, which may restrict our current and future business and operations. 

Since November 2023, we are
in violation of our scheduled monthly instalment payment obligations of 215,337 per month on our lease liability with Leaseplan India
Private Limited Leaseplan ). Leaseplan notified us on February 7, 2024, that we are in default of our November
2023 payment. As of the date hereof, we are in default beyond the 30-day extended cure period (as envisaged under the terms of our debt
with Leaseplan) of our November 2023 payment and continue to be default of all EMIs thereafter. As a result of such defaults, as of the
date hereof, Leaseplan (i) has initiated the process of repossession of all vehicles, and (ii) has invoked the bank guarantee of 120,482
which was a security created by Zoomcar in favor of Leaseplan. Such outcomes may have a material adverse impact on our business, operations
or financial condition. 

89 

Based
on the most recent discussions with Leaseplan, the Company has received an in-principal approval to the restructured debt proposal shared
by the Company wherein the debt after certain waivers and discounts, will stand restructured to 4,755,942 and the agreement for the
restructured debt is yet to be executed. Given this in-principal approval, we do not contemplate any immediate legal action against the
Company in this regard. If we are unable to execute the agreement for the restructured debt or honor the obligations under any agreement
executed hereafter it may, possibly result in inter alia (a) the entire outstanding debt becoming due and payable (, and (b) the
withdrawal of a conditional waiver of 1.2 million which was given during a prior restructuring and will become immediately due and payable
with interest of 1.5 per month. 

The
Company has been in breach of the final payment obligation of 215,437 principal amount owed pursuant to a settlement agreement with
Mercury Car Rentals Private Limited Avis ). Avis had issued a notice notifying us of this default and for initiation
of arbitration proceedings . For the period the overdue amount remains unpaid, interest accrues at the rate of 24 per ann um.
Partial payments of 23,937 in June 2024 and of 59,695 in September 2024 (as of the date the total outstanding dues are 155, 205)
towards the final payment obligation have been made by the Company in lieu of an in-principal waiver from Avis on deferment of all further
legal action against Zoomcar an d a conditional waiver on the 24 default interest up to November 30, 2024, provided that the Company
duly pays the outstanding amounts in two tranches, the last being due on November 30, 2024. Should the Company fail to honor the payments,
they may revoke the in-principal waiver along with the conditional waiver of the 24 default interest and continue with available debt
recovery proceedings as earlier notified by Avis. Such an outcome may have a material adverse impact on our business, operations or financial
condition. 

The Company is in breach of the payment obligation of 408,351 pursuant
to the terms of the settlement deed with Orix Leasing and Financial Services Limited Orix ). Orix has issued a default
notice during May 2024. . Thereafter, Orix had initiated mediation proceedings on August 13, 2024 at Delhi HC legal service committee
for settlement of outstanding dues. Based on the most recent discussions with Orix, the Company has received an in-principle approval
to the settlement terms proposed by the Company on November 7, 2024 from Orix which has agreed to extend the timeline for repayment of
the outstanding dues. The terms of the settlement have also been produced before the appointed mediator on November 7, 2024 and the final
settlement agreement once executed is expected to be taken on record in the upcoming date for the mediation proceedings i.e. November
19, 2024 If we are unable to execute the agreement for the accepted settlement terms or fail to honor the obligations under any settlement
agreement executed hereafter Orix may pursue debt recovery measures against the Company. Such an outcome may have material adverse impact
on our business, operations or financial condition. 

We
are also in breach of the final payment obligation of 343,406 on our loan with Blacksoil Capital Private Limited Blacksoil ).
On June 19, 2024, Blacksoil has issued a default notice as per the debenture trust and hypothecation deed dated April 16, 2019, and the
related amendment agreements Debenture Agreements and to show cause within 7 (seven) days from the date of receipt of
the notice as to why the Debenture Trustee and the Debenture Holder should not proceed with insolvency proceedings against the Company.
Upon discussions Blacksoil and the Company has executed a settlement agreement dated September 30, 2024, for restructured debt amounting
to 257,554. Accordingly, we do not contemplate any immediate legal action against the Company in this regard. If we are unable to honor
the terms of the restructured debt it may, possibly result in inter alia (a) levy of a default coupon on the applicable outstanding
amounts, (b) the available securities and guarantees being enforced or invoked, (c) maturity and redemption of the debentures being accelerated
and, (d) any other legal proceedings for redemption of such amounts due under the Debenture Agreements. Such outcomes may have a material
adverse impact on our business, operations or financial condition. 

Further
we are in violation of the final payment obligation of 6,05,301 on our loan with Mahindra Mahindra Financial Services Limited Mahindra ). As of the date hereof, Mahindra has not formally extended or provided a waiver of such overdue payment.
Mahindra may initiate legal action for resolution of the dispute. Such outcomes may have a material adverse impact on our business, operations
or financial condition. 

90 

Additionally,
we are in various stages of discussion on deferment with our other lenders with regards to the November 2023, December 2023, January
2024, February 2024, March 2024, April 2024, May 2024, June 2024, July 2024, August 2024, September 2024 and October 2024 scheduled loan
payments. However, we have not received any formal notice of default from other lenders, but such lenders have not formally extended
or provided waivers of such overdue payments. 

As
a result of the foregoing, the Company is at material risk that the above parties including certain vendors could initiate insolvency
proceedings under Indian Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC). As per the provisions of IBC, an operational creditor can initiate
an insolvency resolution process against the Company where the minimum amount of the default is INR 1,00,00,000 (Rupees One crore)
or ~USD 119,000. If insolvency proceedings were initiated and the petition is admitted, it could result in significant disruptions to
our operations, loss of management control, and a substantial decrease in stockholder value. Furthermore, the outcomes of such
proceedings are uncertain and could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. 

The
Zoomcar Board and Zoomcar management are evaluating options to improve liquidity and address Zoomcar s long-term capital structure,
however, there can be no assurance that any such option or plan will be available on favorable terms, or at all. 

We
have issued a significant number of options and warrants and exercise of these securities and the sale of the shares of Common Stock
issuable thereunder (along with the issuance of any similar securities in the future,) will dilute your percentage ownership interest
and may also result in downward pressure on the price of our Common Stock. 

As of September 30, 2024,
we have issued and outstanding options to purchase 205 shares (20,432 shares prior to the Reverse Stock Split) of our Common
Stock with a weighted average exercise price of 573 and warrants to purchase 1,813,449 shares (104,540,952 shares prior to
the Reverse Stock Split) of our Common Stock with a weighted average exercise price of 130.38. Included among those warrants are the
warrants issued in our June 2024 financing which such warrants are exercisable upon receipt of stockholder approval and contain the alternative
cashless exercise provision, reset provision and full ratchet anti-dilution protection described elsewhere herein. Because the
market for our Common Stock is thinly traded, the sales and/or the perception that those sales may occur, could adversely affect the market
price of our Common Stock. Furthermore, even though the options and warrants (other than the warrants issued in June 2024) are all out
of the money, the mere existence of a significant number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of these securities may be perceived
by the market as having a potential dilutive effect, which could lead to a decrease in the price of our Common Stock. 

As of October 31, 2024 ,
we have issued and outstanding options to purchase 205 shares of our Common Stock with a weighted average exercise price of 573
and warrants to purchase 1,813,449 shares (3,249,250 shares prior to the Reverse Stock Split) with a weighted average exercise price
of 103.38 (in each case, assuming that the June Warrants are adjusted down to the Floor Price and there is a corresponding
adjustment to the number of June Warrants outstanding following the Share Combination Event). Included among those warrants are
the warrants issued in our June 2024 financing which such warrants contain the alternative cashless exercise provision,
reset provision and full ratchet anti-dilution protection described elsewhere herein. Because the market for our Common Stock
is thinly traded, the sales and/or the perception that those sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Common
Stock. Furthermore, even though the options and warrants (other than the warrants issued in June 2024) are all out of the money,
the mere existence of a significant number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of these securities may be perceived
by the market as having a potential dilutive effect, which could lead to a decrease in the price of our Common Stock. 

91 

Our
success depends upon our ability to maintain favorable customer reviews and ratings, and if our reputation suffers, our business, financial
condition and operating results may be adversely affected. 

We
have a customized rating and review system connected to our search-and-ranking-base algorithm in order to provide a more holistic, more
relevant overall search experience for the Guests. By combining Host ratings and reviews into the overall sort algorithm, our platform
is able to highlight particular Hosts who are more likely to receive bookings. The reliable and trustworthy ratings and reviews of our
Hosts and Guests are crucial to our business, which will to a substantial extent affect our Hosts and Guests determination as
to whether to utilize the platform to book cars. 

Monitor
the rating and review system on an ongoing basis to enforce quality standards and build trust among members of our community. We have
procedures in place to combat fraud or abuse of our rating and review system, but there is no assurance that these procedures are or
will be effective, or at all. Further, Hosts and Guests can leave reviews or ratings on third-party platforms or websites, which are
out of our control and off platform reviews and ratings or other statements about the platform, or a business or brand may have adverse
impact on our business operations. If any Hosts and Guests leave negative ratings and reviews, it may not only cause a decrease in the
number of existing Hosts and Guests, but also may negatively affect acquisitions of new Hosts and Guests, which may adversely affect
our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Unreliable ratings and reviews could also make it more difficult for us
to enforce quality standards, which could damage our reputation and reduce trust within our community. 

Additionally,
our ability to attract and retain Hosts and Guests is dependent in part on our ability to provide high-quality customer support services.
Hosts and Guests depend on our customer support centers to resolve any issues relating to our platform both during and after their trips.
As we continue to grow our business and improve our platform, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support services
at scale. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm
our reputation and adversely affect our ability to scale our platform and business, our financial condition, and results of operations. 

A
former consultant to Zoomcar has commenced a lawsuit against Zoomcar asserting that he is entitled to compensation in connection with
prior Zoomcar transactions and the Business Combination. 

Effective
May 1, 2020, Zoomcar executed an engagement letter with a consultant (the Former Consultant pursuant to which the
Former Consultant agreed to provide a variety of business development services including arranging and negotiating a potential merger
or similar reorganization which Zoomcar intended to evaluate or enter into soon after executing the engagement letter. No such transaction
occurred during the term of the engagement letter, and Zoomcar terminated the engagement letter in January 2022 (the Engagement
Letter Termination ). Subsequent to the Engagement Letter Termination, Zoomcar engaged in other transactions and entered into
the Merger Agreement with IOAC. On August 4, 2023, the Former Consultant filed a complaint against Zoomcar in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint contains breach and anticipatory breach of contract claims arising from the
Former Consultant s engagement letter, which the Former Consultant alleges entitles him to compensation relating to prior transactions
in which Zoomcar has engaged and further compensation upon consummation of the Business Combination. The complaint seeks declaratory
relief affirming the Former Consultant s alleged continuing right to payment under the terminated engagement letter, together with
attorneys fees, costs and interest, as well as punitive damages. Zoomcar disputes the allegations, is exploring its legal options,
and intends vigorously to defend itself. Most recently the motion to dismiss filed by the Company has been denied vide the orders passed
on October 9 and October 16, 2024, the case remains pending for hearing of motions that were admitted. If the claims and pleas
for declaratory relief set forth in compliant are not promptly and fully dismissed or successfully resolved in Zoomcar s favor
(including by binding and enforceable settlement or final judicial determination, without an ability to appeal to the extent applicable),
the Former Consultant s actions, claims and pleas for damages could have material negative consequences to Zoomcar. Additionally,
there can be no assurance that any efforts or actions that Zoomcar takes in defending against legal actions by the Former Consultant
related to the matters described in the complaint will be successful; moreover, any such efforts or actions by Zoomcar may be time-consuming,
costly, distracting to Zoomcar management and have reputational and other negative effects on Zoomcar its business.

A
former employee of Zoomcar India has instituted a wrongful termination suit and claims that certain Zoomcar options have vested. 

In
February 2023, a former employee of Zoomcar India instituted a suit before the City Civil and Sessions Judge at Mayo Hall, Bengaluru
against Zoomcar India, Zoomcar and IOAC challenging his termination, claiming approximately 400,000 in damages and claiming that 100,000
options to purchase shares of Zoomcar have vested. On March 3, 2023, the City Civil and Sessions Judge at Mayo Hall, Bengaluru, issued
an interim injunction to restrain each of Zoomcar and IOAC from alienating or dealing the 100,000 shares of Zoomcar claimed
by the former employee while the suit is pending. Zoomcar believes that such claims are baseless and is attempting to have the interim
order vacated. In addition, Zoomcar India filed an application in the former employee s suit, seeking that IOAC be deleted from
the array of parties in the suit, inter alia since (i) IOAC is neither a necessary nor a proper party to the suit; (ii) no reliefs have
been sought by the former employee from IOAC; and (iii) there is no cause of action against IOAC. However, there can be no assurance
that Zoomcar India and Zoomcar will be successful in their efforts to have the matter vacated or IOAC deleted from the parties, and such
efforts may be time-consuming, costly and may have reputational and other negative effects on Zoomcar. 

We
received a statement of arbitration claim from certain of our warrant holders related to the purported cashless exercise of their warrants.

On January 30, 2024, we
received a statement of arbitration claim before Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., with Aegis Capital Corp., Adam Stern,
and the Robert J. Eide Pension Plan being the claimants therein. The Claim alleges breaches of certain agreements between (a) the Company
and Aegis, and (b) Adam Stern and the Robert J. Eide Pension Plan as warrant holders, on the one hand, and the Company on the other;
it seeks damages preliminarily believed to be at least 10,000,000 purportedly arising from the alleged breaches. The Claim
also seeks amounts for attorneys fees and costs, as well as an order of rescission with respect to the issuance of certain allegedly
wrongfully dilutive shares of Common Stock issued in connection with the Business Combination or, alternatively, an order mandating
a purportedly anti-dilutive issuance of additional shares of Common Stock to the claimants. On January 31, 2024, the claimants filed
an action in the New York State Supreme Court in aid of the arbitration, including seeking by order to show cause substantially the same
relief as the Claim on a declaratory basis. The Court denied the application for a mandatory injunction granting ultimate relief on the
record. Claimants filed a separate order to show cause seeking attachment of the Company s assets arguing the Company did not have
sufficient working capital to satisfy a potential award based on its public filings. The Court found that while Claimants had not shown
a likelihood of success in their theory of the case, it was likely something would be owed. An order, granting claimants the right to
attach up to 3,399,878 of Zoomcar s assets in New York along with other relief, was issued and later modified by the New York
Appellate Division, First Department. A motion seeking to stay or modify that order is currently pending in the First Department and
the parties are awaiting the start of arbitration. While the Company believes that the claims are not supported by the facts or
law and there was no breach of agreements as alleged, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in their efforts
to have the matter vacated, and such efforts may be time-consuming, costly and may have reputational and other negative effects on the
Company. On June 18, 2024, in connection with the Company s agreement to engage Aegis as placement agent as mentioned under Liquidity
and Capital Resources section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The parties thereafter agreed to defer all further action with respect to the arbitration and associated litigation until June 18, 2025. 

The
founder/former CEO has initiated a civil complaint against the Company contesting the reasons for his termination and has raised certain
other claims with regards to his shareholding and compensation for termination of his employment. 

On
September 26, 2024, we received a copy of a complaint filed with the United States District Court for the District of Delaware wherein
our founder and former CEO Mr. Moran has challenged the Company s termination of his employment for cause, effective as of June
18, 2024,. Mr. Moran has contested the facts leading up to the grounds on which his termination was based and has also claimed that this
alleged wrongful termination has also deprived him of his vested right to 8 of the Company s outstanding equity that he claims
was owed to him under his Employment Agreement. He has also claimed that in connection with his termination he is entitled to the payment
of certain amounts for unused paid leave during his employment with Zoomcar, along with certain bonuses he claims to be owed under the
terms of his Employment Agreement, as well as severance equal to one year s base salary. Zoomcar believes that the Mr. Moran s
employment, for cause, was properly terminated in accordance with the terms of his Employment Agreement. As of October 31, 2024, the
suit has been dismissed on account of Mr. Moran s intention to refile the case in Delaware Superior Court. However, there can be
no assurance that the Company will be successful in defending these claims in its entirety should Mr. Moran choose to refile the suit,
and such efforts may be time-consuming, costly and may have reputational and other negative effects on Zoomcar.

If
the pre-programmed IoT devices distributed to our Hosts to affix to registered cars, which IoT devices enable GPS tracking and data collection
by Zoomcar and keyless, digital access to booked vehicles by Guests, do not function as they are intended to function, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

As
part of our vehicle registration process, all Hosts are provided with an option to install a variety of customized software-enabled IoT
devices These devices, which Zoomcar obtains from several suppliers and then programs prior to distribution to Hosts, serve multiple
functions, including enabling Guests to access Host vehicles by digitized keyless access and start and end bookings using Zoomcar s
mobile app. The IoT devices also facilitate GPS monitoring by Zoomcar of in-trip vehicles, which serves a data collection function that
is important to Zoomcar. 

We
have no control over the quality or functionality of the IoT devices distributed to Hosts and such devices may not function as intended
or may be out of service during the course of a booking or while a Guest is attempting to access a booked vehicle. In such scenarios,
Guests are able to contact Hosts via number masking call or text chat enabled by Zoomcar Guest App. However, failures to provide the
seamless keyless functions may deny or delay Guests quick access to the vehicles, thus reducing Guests interest in utilizing
our platform. Hosts, in turn, may rely on Zoomcar s customer support functionality to facilitate connecting Guests to emergency
services in the event of a vehicle accident or other situation that, if unresolved, could result in damage to a Host vehicle. If Zoomcar
is unable to help Guests that encounter problems during bookings, it could result in complaints and negative reviews from both Hosts
and Guests, and higher incidents of damages claims to Zoomcar by Hosts, leading to adverse consequences to our reputation, brand, business,
prospects, and operating results. 

We
do not have long term contracts with the third-party suppliers of the IoT devices distributed to our Hosts and such suppliers can reduce
quantities or terminate their sales of IoT devices to us at any time. Any adverse changes in such supply or the costs of such products
or services may adversely affect our operations. 

We
collaborate with third-party suppliers who regularly provide products and services, including but not limited to IoT devices and software
integrations, to us. We do not have long term purchase agreements in place with our current suppliers of the IoT devices that we program
and advise our Hosts to install in the vehicles that they register to our platform and our suppliers could reduce the quantity of or
discontinue providing IoT devices suitable for our needs. Given that the Hosts now have an option to install/not install these devices,
we do not currently anticipate material challenges to identifying replacement suppliers if shortages of IoT devices occur, we are reliant
on third parties to provide such devices and unanticipated shortages or an inability to identify new suppliers if our existing suppliers
cease to be willing or able to provide the IoT devices on terms and at costs acceptable to Zoomcar may occur. Any such shortages, reductions
or terminations in IoT device supply arrangements may indirectly lead up to an adverse impact on our revenues, profits and financial
condition. Additionally, if the market prices for IoT devices that are suitable for our needs goes up, we may need to purchase the devices
at a comparatively higher price, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We
have limited control over the operations of our suppliers and other business partners and any significant interruption in their operations
may have an adverse impact on our operations. For example, a significant interruption in the operations of our supplier s production
facilities could cause delay or termination of shipment of the IoT devices to us, which may, in turn, reduce or delay our ability to
pre-program and distribute such devices to Hosts which may in turn affect the retention of Hosts who are more inclined towards
installing the devices leading to a lower availability of inventory on our Platform. 

As
our operations continue to scale and grow, we anticipate needing an increased number of IoT devices, and our demand therefore may exceed
the capabilities of our existing suppliers. If our suppliers cease to supply adequate numbers of IoT devices to us, or if we need alternative
sources of supply for any other reason, those devices may not be immediately available to us. If alternative suppliers are not immediately
available, we will have to identify and qualify alternative suppliers, and the installation of such devices on vehicles which Hosts wish
to add to our platform may be delayed. We may not be able to find adequate alternative or additional suppliers in a reasonable period
of time or on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. An inability to obtain sufficient supply of IoT devices which we can program
for platform use may delay installation of such devices on vehicles that would otherwise become registered or more promptly registered
to our platform, harm our relationships with Hosts, which could adversely affect our business and operations. 

94 

Maintaining
and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. While we have taken significant steps to build and improve
our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer. 

As
our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of
our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our platform offerings. Our brand and reputation
may also be harmed by events outside of our control, including by perceptions of our business or our platform which are subjective in
nature. For example, if Hosts misrepresent the features or safety of their vehicles in platform listings or otherwise provide diminished
quality of vehicles, Guests may not have positive experiences with bookings and may not return to the platform for future transportation
needs. If Guests, in turn, do not treat Host vehicles with care, engage in reckless driving or other malfeasance during booked trips
or violate platform terms and conditions or use Host vehicles in the commission of crimes or illegal acts, their actions could cause
Hosts to withdraw vehicles from our platform or pursue damages claims against Zoomcar. Events ranging from unanticipated litigation involving
Zoomcar to trip cancellations by Guests may affect perceptions of our business by individual Hosts and Guests or of larger numbers of
persons or groups of persons about our platform and the perceived benefits or risks to booking cars through our platform. Because our
ratings and review system encourage and facilitates public sharing of Hosts and Guests experience with bookings and with
our platform, platform users have a forum to express describe their individual, subjective experiences with Host vehicles, bookings and
any other aspect of our business, which may not always be favorable. Although we monitor usage of our platform review and ratings systems,
we cannot control behaviors of our customers and from time to time platform features designed to encourage productive information sharing
may lead to dissemination of information which is misleading, misrepresentative, false and which may be damaging to our reputation. Any
of the foregoing, among other facts and circumstances, may result in unfavorable press coverage of Zoomcar and our reputation and, consequently,
our business may be harmed. 

The
acceptance of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an
improved culture and workplace practices, improving existing functions, feature and technologies, developing new functions, features
and technologies of our platform, maintaining a high quality of customer service and ethical behavior and continuing our marketing and
public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies involve and will continue to involve significant
costs yet may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will scale and expand their business,
which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully
maintain our brand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception
of our Company, our brand and reputation would be further damaged, and our business may suffer. 

The
impact of adverse or changing economic conditions, including the resulting effects on consumer spending or mobility patterns, may adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Our
business depends on the overall demand for vehicle bookings. Any significant weakening of the economy in our operating jurisdictions
or of the global economy, including the current macroeconomic downturn, more limited availability of credit, economic uncertainty, inflation,
financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets, increased unemployment rates, restrictions and reduction in domestic
or international travel, fluctuations in the price or availability of gasoline, and other adverse economic or market conditions may adversely
impact our business and operating results. Global economic and political events or uncertainty may cause some of our current or potential
Hosts and Guests to curtail their use of our platform. In addition, travel has been disproportionately impacted by a macroeconomic downturn.
In response to such downturns, Hosts and Guests may not use or spend on our platform at rates we expect, thus further reducing demand
for vehicle bookings. These adverse conditions have in the past resulted, and could in the future result in, reductions in consumer spending,
slower adoption of new technologies, and increased competition. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown,
including the current macroeconomic downturn, or any subsequent recovery generally. In addition, increases in inflation may cause Guests
to decrease travel or choose alternative or lower cost methods of transportation versus utilizing our platform. If the conditions in
the general economy significantly deviate from present levels and continue to deteriorate as a result of any such macroeconomic downturns,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Increases
in, labor, energy, and other costs could adversely affect our operating results. 

Factors
such as inflation, increased labour and employee benefit costs, and increased technology upgrade and updated costs, as well as other
inflationary pressure, may increase our operating costs. Many of the factors affecting such costs are beyond our control cause these
increased costs may cause us to pass costs on to Hosts and Guests by increasing certain fees paid by them to us, which may cause booking
volume to decline, which would harm our business and operating results. 

95 

Our
operations have grown substantially since our inception, and we expect that they will continue to do so, subject to our financial condition.
If we are unable to effectively manage that growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected. 

Since
our inception, we have experienced significant growth in the scale of our operations. This expansion increases the complexity of our
business and places significant strains on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources,
and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation,
limit our growth, increase our costs, and negatively affect the results of operations. Our business is becoming increasingly complex,
and this complexity and our rapid growth have demanded, and will continue to demand, substantial resources and attention from our management. 

Further,
to accommodate our expected growth, we must improve and maintain our platform, technology, systems, and network infrastructure. Failure
to effectively upgrade our technology or network infrastructure to support the expected increased traffic on our platform could result
in unanticipated system disruptions, slow response times, or poor experiences for Hosts and Guests. To manage the expected growth of
our operations and to support financial reporting requirements, we will need to improve our transaction processing and reporting, operational
and financial systems and reporting, procedures, and controls. These improvements will be particularly challenging to realize if we acquire
new operations with different systems or if we continue to rely on manual financial reporting practices. Our current and planned personnel,
systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations, improve
our financial reporting processes, and hire additional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, it could adversely affect our business,
customer and investor satisfaction, compliance with regulations and laws, and cause our expenses to grow disproportionately relative
to our revenue, and our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected. 

Breaches
and other types of security incidents of our networks or systems, or those of our third-party service providers, could negatively impact
our business, our brand and reputation, our ability to retain existing Hosts and Guests and attract new Hosts and Guests, may cause us
to incur significant liabilities and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects. 

In the regular course of our business, we collect, use, store, transmit,
and process data and information about Hosts, Guests, employees, and others, some of which may be sensitive, personal, or confidential
and make us an attractive target and potentially vulnerable to cyberattacks, computer viruses, electronic break-ins or similar disruptions.
Any actual or perceived unauthorized access to or use of such data and information, or breach of our security measures or those of our
third-party service providers, could adversely affect our business, operations, and future prospects. While we have taken steps to mitigate
our cyberattack risks and protect the confidential information that we have access to, including but not limited to installation and periodical
updates of antivirus software and backup of information on our computer systems, our security measures could be breached. Because techniques
used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against
a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any cybersecurity incident,
accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our systems could cause confidential information to be stolen
and used for criminal purposes. Cybersecurity incidents, security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information could also
expose us to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity. If security
measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in our technology infrastructure
are exposed and exploited, our relationships with our Hosts and Guests could be severely damaged, we could incur significant liability,
and our business and operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, if we fail to protect confidential information, we may be susceptible
to potential claims such as breach of contract, negligence or other claims. Such claims will require considerable time and resources to
defend and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained. 

96 

An
increasing number of organizations, including large online and offline merchants and businesses, other large Internet companies, financial
institutions, and government institutions have disclosed breaches of their information security systems and other information security
incidents, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks. In addition, users on our platform could have vulnerabilities
on their own mobile devices that are entirely unrelated to our systems and platform, but which could mistakenly be attributed to us and
our system and platform. Further, breaches experienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing
and ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly common, and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult
to identify and prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored or supported by significant financial and technological resources, making
them even more difficult to detect. If a third party or employee circumvents any of our security measures or those of our third-party
service providers, they may access, misappropriate, delete, alter, publish, or modify this information, which could cause interruptions
in our business and operations, fraud or loss to third parties, regulatory enforcement actions, litigation, indemnity obligations, competitive
harm, and other possible liabilities, as well as negative publicity. Widespread negative publicity may also result from real, threatened,
or perceived security compromises (or lack of adequate security measures) of our industry, competitors, Hosts, and Guests. Concerns regarding
privacy and data security could cause some Hosts and Guests to stop using our services, and for employees to be less satisfied with their
employment with us and potentially leave the Company or institute claims against us. This discontinuance in use and the potential failure
to acquire new Hosts and Guests, and similar personnel issues, could substantially harm our business, results of operations, financial
condition, and future prospects. 

Our
information technology systems, internal computer systems, cloud-based computing services, and those of our current and any future third-party
service providers are vulnerable to interruption and intrusion. Cyberattacks and other malicious internet-based activity, such as insider
threats, computer malware, hacking, and phishing attempts continue to increase. Any cybersecurity incident or material disruption or
slowdown of our systems could cause outages or delays in our services, which could harm our brand and adversely affect our operating
results. Our failure to implement adequate cybersecurity protections could subject us to claims for any breach of security, particularly
if it results in disclosure of information relating to our Hosts or Guests. If changes in technology cause our systems to become obsolete,
or if our systems are inadequate to facilitate our growth, we could lose Hosts or Guests, and our business and operating results could
be adversely affected. From time to time, and especially in 2018, we have experienced security incidents or attempted attacks, and in
some instances, individuals have had their personal information compromised. We conduct investigations when we become aware of such incidents
and/or attempted attacks (although our investigations may not be able to determine the method of attack) and may notify affected persons,
as necessary. In addition to traditional computer hackers employing malicious code (such as viruses, worms, and ransomware)
to breach our systems and platform, we are susceptible to and monitor for social engineering, cyber extortion, and personnel theft or
misuse. 

We
may also be the subject of denial-of-service attacks, server malfunction, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other computer
assets, adware, or other similar issues. Threat actors, nation states, and nation state-supported actors engage in cyberattacks, including
for geopolitical reasons, continued opportunistic monetary reasons, and in connection with military conflicts and operations. During
times of war and other major conflicts, we and our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to these attacks, including cyberattacks
that could materially disrupt our systems, platform and operations. While we have security measures in place to protect customer information
and prevent data loss, service interruption, and other security breaches, we cannot guarantee that our security measures or our third-party
service providers security measures will be sufficient to protect against unauthorized access to, or other compromise of, personal
information, confidential information, or proprietary information or of disruptions or damage to our systems. The techniques used to
sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to our platform, systems, networks, and/or physical facilities in which data is stored or through
which data is transmitted change frequently, and we may be unable to anticipate such techniques or implement adequate preventative measures
or stop security breaches that may arise from such techniques. As a result, our safeguards and preventive measures may not be adequate
to prevent current or future cyberattacks and security incidents, including security breaches that may remain undetected for extended
periods of time, which can substantially increase the potential for a material and adverse impact resulting from the breach. 

We
are required to comply with laws, rules, industry standards, and regulations that require us to maintain the security of personal information
in India. We may also have contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. Failure to prevent
or mitigate cyberattacks could result and has in the past resulted in unauthorized access to such data, including personal information.
India has enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals, regulatory authorities, and others of security breaches involving certain
types of data. In addition, our agreements with certain partners may require us to notify them in the event of a security breach. Such
disclosures are and could be costly, could lead to negative publicity, may cause Hosts and Guests to lose confidence in the effectiveness
of our security measures and to not use our services, and may require us to expend significant capital and other resources to respond
to and/or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach. In addition, the costs to respond to a cybersecurity
event or to mitigate any identified security vulnerabilities could be significant, including costs for remediating the effects of such
an event, paying a ransom, restoring data from backups, and conducting data analysis to determine what data may have been affected by
the breach. In addition, our efforts to contain or remediate a security breach or any system vulnerability may be unsuccessful, and our
efforts and any related failures to contain or remediate any breach or vulnerabilities could result in interruptions, delays, loss in
customer trust, harm to our reputation, and increases in our insurance premiums. 

97 

We do not currently have insurance coverage for security incidents
or breaches, including fines, judgments, settlements, penalties, costs, attorney fees, and other impacts that arise out of incidents or
breaches. While we may obtain cyber liability insurance in the future, we cannot assure you that such insurance coverage will adequately
cover liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.
The successful assertion against us of one or more large claims that exceeds available insurance coverage, or that results in changes
to insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an
adverse effect on our business. Our risks are likely to increase as we continue to expand, grow our Host and Guest base, and process,
store, and transmit increasingly substantial amounts of confidential, proprietary and sensitive data. 

We
face competition and could lose market share to competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating
results. 

We
face and expect to continue to face competition from ride sharing companies, car rental and taxi companies. The car sharing market in
particular is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting guest needs and preferences, and frequent
introductions of new services and offerings. We expect competition to increase, both from existing competitors and new entrants in the
markets in which we operate or plan to operate, and such competitors may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic
advantages. If Zoomcar is unable to anticipate or successfully react to these competitive challenges in a timely manner, Zoomcar s
competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and Zoomcar could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnation that could
adversely affect Zoomcar s business, financial condition and operating results. 

Certain
of our current and potential competitors may have greater financial, technical, marketing, research and development skills and other
resources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories or a larger global user base than we do. Such competitors may be able
to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of offerings, and they may be able to offer lower prices in certain
markets than we do, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These and other factors may
allow our competitors to derive greater revenue and profits from their existing user bases, attract and retain Hosts and Guests at lower
costs or respond more quickly to new and emerging technologies and trends. Current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative
or strategic relationships, or consolidate, amongst themselves or with third parties, which may further enhance their resources and offerings
relative to ours. 

We
believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including but not limited
to: 

acceptance of car-sharing
 and the use of our platform to solve transportation needs in the emerging markets in which we operate; 

our ability to attract
 and retain Guests and Hosts to use our platform; 

the popularity and perceived
 utility, ease of use, performance and reliability of our platform; 

our brand strength and
 recognition; 

our pricing models and
 the prices of our offerings; 

our ability to manage our
 business and operations during a pandemic and related travel restrictions if and when imposed upon outbreak of a pandemic; 

98 

our ability to continue
 developing platform features which appeal to changing customer preferences; 

our ability to continue
 leveraging and enhancing our data collection and analytics capabilities; 

our ability to establish
 and maintain relationships with strategic partners and third-party suppliers or providers; 

changes mandated by legislation,
 regulatory authorities or litigation, including settlements, judgments, injunctions and consent decrees, as well as changes that
 we may elect to make ourselves in the face of potential litigation, legislation, or regulatory scrutiny; 

our ability to attract,
 retain and motivate talented employees; and 

our ability to raise additional
 capital. 

If
we are unable to compete successfully, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. 

We
rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make its platform available to Hosts and Guests, and failure to effectively
operate with or receive favorable placements within such application marketplaces could adversely affect Zoomcar s business, financial
condition and operating results. 

We
depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective app marketplaces, to make our app available
to Hosts and Guests. Any changes in such systems and app marketplaces that degrade the functionality or popularity of our app could adversely
affect our platform s usage on mobile devices and may adversely affect our user ratings and reviews in app marketplaces. If such
mobile operating systems or app marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our app available to Hosts and Guests, or if such systems
or marketplaces make changes that degrade the functionality of our app, slow the rollout of our app on other app marketplaces, increase
the cost of using our app, impose terms of use that are unsatisfactory to us, require users to opt in to enable marketing or advertising
features, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, our Guest growth may be negatively affected.
Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Our
business depends on attracting and retaining capable management, technology development and operating personnel. 

Our
success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, technology development and operating personnel.
Competition for qualified employees is intense in our industry. There can be no assurance that members of our management team will continue
to work for Zoomcar, or that we will be able to continue to attract or retain employees focused on technology development or other important
aspects of our business and operations. Our employees, including members of our management team, could leave our Company with little
or no prior notice and would be free to work for a competitor. The loss of even a few qualified employees, or an inability to attract,
retain, and motivate additional highly skilled employees required to carry out our business plans, could harm our operating results and
impair our ability to grow. If we were to lose key members of our management or technology teams, we would need to replace them with
qualified individuals in a timely manner or else our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.
Additionally, certain of our executive officers and directors may allocate their time to other businesses, thereby causing potential
conflicts of interests which could have a negative impact on our business operations. 

We
also do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees. The departure of one or more of our senior management
team members or other key employees could be disruptive to our business until we are able to hire qualified successors. 

To
attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including an equity incentive program for key executive officers and other
employees. These measures may not be enough to attract and retain the personnel we require to operate and grow our business effectively.
If we fail to identify, hire, train and retain qualified management or technology personnel in the future, it may materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

99 

We
are subject to payment-related risks. 

We
accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit or debit cards, or digital payment alternatives like UPI or other specific
digital wallet platforms. As our payment policies are subject to change from time to time in accordance with evolving legal requirements
and market availability of mobile and other payment systems in different jurisdictions where we operate, we offer new payment options
to Hosts and Guests from time to time, subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements, and fraud risks. For certain payment
methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees that may increase over time and may increase our operating
costs and lower profitability. 

We
rely on third-party payment processors to process payments, refunds, and reimbursements. Under our commercial agreements with these third
parties, they may terminate the relationships with us at any time in their sole discretions. If one of these third parties terminates
its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we could incur substantial delays
and expenses in locating and integrating an alternative payment service provider to process payments from Hosts and Guests, and the quality
and reliability of any such alternative payment service provider may not be comparable. Further, the software and services provided by
these third parties may not meet our expectations, may contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be compromised or experience outages.
Additionally, payment processing software is complex and involves automated processes implemented by us and the third parties that we
engage. Therefore, the payment processing software can be misinterpreted and may be susceptible to errors. These risks could cause us,
to lose our ability to accept and account for online payment or other payment transactions, make timely payments to Hosts, or result
in over- or underpayments to Hosts, any of which could disrupt our business for an extended period of time, make our platform less convenient
and attractive to users, expose user information to unauthorized disclosures and abuse, and adversely affect our ability to attract and
retain Hosts and Guests, or materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, ability to forecast accurately, and results
of operations. 

If
we are unable to maintain our chargeback or refund rates at levels that credit or debit card issuers, or payment processors deem acceptable,
these entities may increase fees for chargeback transactions or for many or all categories of transactions; they may also increase the
rates of declining transactions or terminate their relationships with us. Any increases in fees could adversely affect our operating
results, particularly if we elect not to raise the prices for transactions on our platform to offset the increase. The termination of
our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit cards or through certain online payment service providers or payment processors
could significantly impair our ability to operate our business. 

We
may also be subject to, or may voluntarily comply with, a number of other laws and regulations relating to money laundering, money transmission,
international money transfers, privacy and information security, and electronic fund transfers. If we are found to be in violation of
such applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease our payments processing services
or otherwise make changes to our business practices. 

Any
major disruption or failure of our information technology systems, or our failure to successfully implement new technology effectively,
could adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. 

We
rely on various information technology systems, owned by us and third parties, to manage our operations. Over the last several years,
we have been and continue to implement modifications and upgrades to our systems, including making changes to legacy systems, replacing
legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality, and acquiring new systems with new functionality. These activities subject
us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and upgrading these systems, including impairment of our ability to fulfil trip
bookings, maintain books and records, potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional
administration and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands
on management time, and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new or upgraded systems or of integrating
new or upgraded systems into our current systems. Our system implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level that
outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. In addition, the difficulties with implementing new or upgraded technology systems
may cause disruptions in our business operations and may have an adverse effect on our business and operations if not anticipated and
appropriately mitigated. 

100 

The
successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that
are not under our control. 

Our business depends on the efficient, uninterrupted and reliable operations
of internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. We may operate in certain geographic areas with limited
internet connectivity. Internet access and access to a mobile device are frequently provided by companies with significant market power,
which could result in corporate action that degrades, disrupts, or increases the cost of users ability to access our platform.
Failure to effectively upgrade our technology or internet infrastructure to support the expected increased utilization of our platform
by larger numbers of Hosts and Guests could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow response times, or poor experiences for Hosts
and Guests. In addition, the internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any particular geographic area may be
unable to support the demands placed upon it. Any such failure in internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for a brief
period of time, could interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the
services provided by national telecommunications operators. If mobile internet access fees or other charges to internet users increase,
consumer traffic may decrease, which in turn may cause our revenue to significantly decrease. If our platform is unavailable when users
attempt to access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as users expect, Hosts and Guests may not return to our platform as
often in the future, or at all, and may use our competitors products, services, or offerings more often. Although we have attempted
to prepare for contingencies through redundancy measures and disaster recovery plans, such preparation may not be sufficient, and we do
not carry business interruption insurance. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake,
flood or fire, or other unanticipated problems in the jurisdictions where we operate, including power outages, telecommunications delays
or failures, break-ins to our systems or computer viruses, could result in delays or interruptions to our platform, our app and website,
and loss of data and business interruption for us and our Hosts and Guests. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly
disrupt our operations and subject us to liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations. 

Our
business operations may result in losses for which we are not insured. 

Our
current business model consists of a peer-to-peer car-sharing platform which facilitates sharing of vehicles between Hosts and Guests.
In this context, we are a facilitator of vehicle bookings but disclaim legal responsibility for cars owned by Hosts and for actions by
Hosts and Guests on our platform and during bookings. Our platform terms and conditions, inform the Hosts and Guests that booking, sharing
and using cars through the platform is undertaken at their own risk; the lease agreement entered into between Hosts and Guests prior
to each booking that occurs in India also disclaims our responsibility for Host and Guest property and for other damages incurred in
relation to bookings. We also include in our platform terms and conditions a limit on our overall liability equal to the greater of the
booking value of each trip and 120. However, we cannot be certain of the extent to which such disclaimers and limitations would be upheld
as legally enforceable in every jurisdiction or circumstance. We regularly receive communication from Hosts (and from time to time, Guests)
asserting that we are responsible, and requesting reimbursement for damages to vehicles, lost property and other losses. All of our Guests
pay a value added trip protection fee as part of a booking, however, the amount available to us from Guest trip protection
fees is not sufficient to offset the amounts requested to cover the cost of all damages claims, nor do we attempt to offset all such
requests to cover vehicle damage. As a result, we often remain at risk of residual claims that we may have to absorb in the absence of
third-party insurance. 

Further,
we currently do not carry any insurance to protect against third-party damage claims tied to death, personal injury, Host vehicle damages,
or Guest or Host theft or other losses, or third-party property damage. Although Hosts may insure their own vehicles to varying extents
and are required to do so by law, we do not carry out independent verification of Host insurance coverage, nor does Host vehicle insurance
coverage, to the extent it exists, insulate us, in full or in part, from all types of damages claims or claims for third-party indemnification
associated with damages. We may therefore be subject to claims of significant liability based on any of the foregoing or based on other
events or circumstances which occur during a booking or relate in some other manner to our platform or our business. We do not maintain
balance sheet reserves to cover costs of defending, disputing, adjudicating, satisfying or settling any such claims if they are asserted
against us and we may not be able to succeed in any such actions, should they materialize and be determined to result in liability to
us. While we are currently in the process of identifying adequate and feasible insurance coverage for our business , there can be no
guarantee that we will be able to obtain or expand the insurance coverage in the future, and even if we are able to obtain additional
coverage, we may not carry sufficient insurance coverage to satisfy potential claims. As our business continues to grow, incidences of
such claims may also increase and, unless we obtain insurance coverage for such matters, we may choose or be required to absorb larger
parts of such uninsured claims to avoid becoming subject to legal proceedings that could be resolved against us, which could lead to
business losses and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Should uninsured losses occur, they
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, our being subject to claims of liability,
we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating
results. 

101 

We
are in the process of remediating identified material weaknesses in our internal controls and if we fail to remediate these weaknesses,
or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future, or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal controls in accordance
with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations,
or comply with the accounting and reporting requirements applicable to public companies, which may adversely affect investor confidence
in the Company and the market price of our stock. 

Zoomcar
has identified certain material weaknesses in Zoomcar s internal controls over financial reporting more described under Item 4
above. These material weaknesses primarily relate to the following matters that are relevant to the preparation of our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements: 

(i) The Company designed and implemented process for identification,
monitoring and regulatory compliance of transactions involving related parties. The Company s process includes rolling out related
party transaction questionnaires quarterly to the identified related parties. The management intends to continue to take steps and monitor
the progress of the internal controls implemented. 

(ii) Significant reduction in the number of complex financial
instruments post the reverse recapitalization. The management actively engages with valuation experts to communicate the underlying assumptions
and terms of the financial instruments. The management intends to continue to monitor the progress of the internal controls implemented. 

(iii) Developing financial reporting manuals including Standard
Operating Procedures for financial statement closure process to ensure compliance with US GAAP and SEC reporting requirements and monitoring
controls over financial statement closure process. 

(iv) The Management is working on hiring, training and retention
of inhouse resources with requisite US GAAP knowledge. The management has also engaged external accounting professionals and developing
process for sufficient managements reviews. 

(v) The Management is currently working on developing accounting
manuals, policies and standard operating procedures in consultation with external consultants. 

(vi) The management is in the process of developing ITGC policies
and procedures to address identified deficiencies, ensuring controls are designed and operating effectively. This will include establishing
monitoring mechanisms to regularly evaluate and test the effectiveness of ITGC, including access controls, change management, and data
integrity validation. 

In light of the aforementioned material weaknesses, our management has
performed additional analyses, reconciliations, and other post-closing procedures and has concluded that, notwithstanding the material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods
covered by and included in this Report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cashflows
for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. 

We
are required to comply with the SEC s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management
to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness
of controls over financial reporting. Although we are required to disclose changes made in its internal controls and procedures on a
quarterly basis, we will not be required to make our first annual assessment of its internal control over financial reporting pursuant
to Section 404 until the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC. 

To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we have
undertaken various actions, and will need to take additional actions, such as implementing numerous internal controls and procedures and
hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff or consultants. Testing and maintaining internal control can divert Zoomcar s
management s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of Zoomcar s business. Additionally, when evaluating
Zoomcar s internal control over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in
time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. Investors may lose confidence
in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Common Stock could be negatively affected if any
of the following occurs: (i) we identify any material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting; (ii) we are unable
to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner; (iii) we assert that our internal control over financial reporting
is ineffective; or (iv) our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting once we are no longer an emerging growth company. We could also become subject to investigations
by the SEC, the stock exchange on which its securities are listed, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial
and management resources. In addition, if we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements could be inaccurate, and we
could face restricted access to capital markets. 

102 

If
we do not adequately protect our intellectual property and our data, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could
be materially adversely affected. 

We
rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, domain names, trade names and trade secret laws, international treaties, our terms of
service, other contractual provisions, user policies, restrictions on disclosures, and confidentiality agreements with our employees
and consultants to protect our intellectual property rights from infringement and misappropriation. We currently have 21 registered
trademarks along with three trademarks at variance - refused, abandoned, and opposed; 4 pending patent applications and 1 patent
application withdrawn in India and 7 domain names. 

There
is no assurance that our pending or future trademark, patent, and copyright applications will be approved. Furthermore, effective intellectual
property protection may not be available in every country in which we intend to operate our business and some of the platform features
and other customization of software that is important to our operations is not protected by registered intellectual property rights.
There can be no assurance that others will not offer technologies, functions, features, or concepts that are substantially similar to
ours and compete with our business, or copy or otherwise obtain, disclose and/or use our brand, platform features, design elements, our
search-and-ranking algorithms and machine-learning and artificial intelligence-enhanced tools and capabilities or other information that
we consider proprietary without authorization. We may be unable to prevent third parties from seeking to register, acquire, or otherwise
obtain trademarks, copyrights or domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks, copyrights,
and our other proprietary rights. Third parties may obtain or misappropriate certain of our data through website scraping, robots, or
other means to launch copycat sites, aggregate our data for their internal use, or to feature or provide our data through their respective
websites, and/or launch businesses monetizing this data. While we routinely employ technological and legal measures in an attempt to
divert, halt, or mitigate such operations, we may not always be able to detect or halt the underlying activities as technologies used
to accomplish these operations continue to rapidly evolve. 

If
the protection of our proprietary rights and data is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or misappropriation by third parties, the
value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our technologies,
offerings, or features or methods of operations. Even if we do detect violations or misappropriations and decide to enforce our rights,
litigation that may be necessary to enforce our rights may not be pursued by us, as it may be time-consuming and expensive, and divert
our management s attention. Additionally, a court of a competent jurisdiction may determine that certain of our intellectual property
rights are unenforceable. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and data in a cost-effective and meaningful manner, our competitive
standing could be harmed; our Hosts, Guests, other consumers, and corporate and community partners could devalue the content of our platform;
and our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 

We
have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims that we or others violated certain third-party intellectual property rights, which,
even where meritless, can be costly to defend and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial
condition. 

The
internet and technology industries are characterized by significant creation and protection of intellectual property rights and by frequent
litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of such intellectual property rights. There may
be intellectual property rights, including registered or pending patents, trademarks, and copyrights, and applications of the foregoing,
held by others that they allege cover significant aspects of our platform, technologies, content, branding, or business methods. Moreover,
companies in the Internet and technology industries are frequent targets of practicing and non-practicing entities seeking to profit
from royalties in connection with grants of licenses. 

We
have received communications alleging unauthorized use of third-party trademarks in the past, and may receive in the future, communications
from third parties, including practicing and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed, misused, or otherwise misappropriated
their intellectual property rights. Additionally, we have been, and may in the future be, involved in claims, suits, regulatory proceedings,
and other proceedings involving alleged infringement, misuse, or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property rights, or relating
to our intellectual property holdings and rights. Intellectual property claims against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming
and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert our management s attention and other resources. 

103 

Claims
involving intellectual property could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using certain
technologies, content, branding, or business methods found to be in violation of another party s rights. We might be required or
may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,
or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses.
We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding, or business methods, which could require
significant efforts and expenses and make us less competitive. Any of these results could materially adversely affect our business, results
of operations, and financial condition. 

We
may introduce new platform offerings or changes to existing platform offerings or make other business changes, including in areas where
we currently do not compete, which could increase our exposure to patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights
claims from competitors, other practicing entities, and non-practicing entities. Any failure in maintaining, protecting or enforcing
our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks
related to International, Regulatory and Legal Matters 

Our
business is subject to certain laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, many of which are currently evolving,
and the risk of unfavorable interpretations or failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm Zoomcar s business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

Our
platform currently operates across 99 cities in India. We are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in
the various states in which we operate our business, which are evolving and may change from time to time, which may give rise to inconsistent
or ambiguous interpretations among local, regional, or national laws or regulations applicable to our business. Compliance with laws
and regulations of different states imposing varying standards and requirements is burdensome for businesses like ours, imposes added
cost, increases potential liability to our business, and makes it difficult to realize business efficiencies and economies of scale. 

Relative
to India, which is the location of our headquarters, we operate as an asset-light peer-to-peer carsharing business based on an interpretation
of current legal and regulatory requirements. The operation of our business is informed by a regulatory framework which includes but
is not limited to, the India Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 MVA ), which informs how we operate and the ways in which we
promote our business. However, there can be no assurance that our interpretation of relevant Indian laws and regulations, including the
MVA, is complete or correct, or that transportation authorities in India will interpret the MVA or other applicable regulations the same
way that we do. In the event that the MVA or other applicable laws and regulations are interpreted in a manner unfavorable to us, we
could become the subject of investigations and could potentially face fines, duties, judgments or other negative consequences, which
could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, as our business continues to grow and evolve,
laws and regulations will be amended to address the evolution of our business, resulting in new and unpredictable legal and regulatory
obligations in emerging markets. It may be difficult for us to comply with the new laws and regulations that will be developed to address
changes in our industry and business, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with such new laws and regulations. If our
current or future business models are determined to be noncompliant with the national, regional, and local laws and regulations, we may
be required to make costly adjustments to our business model, which could result in negative consequences, many of which may be outside
of our control and impossible to predict. 

In
addition to laws and regulations directly applicable to the peer-to-peer car sharing businesses, we are subject to laws and regulations
governing other aspects of our business practices, including laws and regulations relating to use of the Internet, e-commerce, and electronic
devices, as well as those relating to taxation, online payments, automobile-related liability, payments, consumer privacy and data protection,
pricing, content, advertising, discrimination, consumer protection, protection of intellectual property rights, distribution, messaging,
mobile communications, environmental matters, labour and employment matters, claims management, electronic contracts, communications,
Internet access, securities and public disclosure, corruption and anti-bribery, and unfair commercial practices. In addition, climate
change and greater emphasis on sustainability could lead to regulatory efforts to address the carbon impact of transportation and mobility,
which could have a negative impact on our business. 

104 

In
addition, the cities /states in which we have business operations may in the future enact new laws and regulations relating to emissions
and other environmental matters associated with peer-to-peer car sharing operations, the peer-to-peer car sharing industry generally,
and the operation of our business. The interpretation and enforcement of such laws may involve significant uncertainties. New laws and
regulations that affect our existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively in ways that we cannot predict
with certainty. 

We
cannot predict the effect that the interpretation of existing or new laws or regulations may have on our business. Any of the foregoing
or similar occurrences or developments could significantly disrupt our business operations and restrict us from conducting a substantial
portion of our business operations in these jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating
results. 

Any
failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations, including the ones described in these risk factors,
or with orders of any governmental authority, including changes to or expansion of their interpretations, may subject us to significant
fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets or enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions.
This failure or perceived failure could also result in the imposition of additional compliance and licensure requirements on us, as well
as increased regulatory scrutiny of our business. In addition, we may be forced to restrict or change our operations or business practices,
make updates or upgrades of our platform, or delay planned launches or improvements of new features, functions and technologies. Any
of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Geographic
areas in which Zoomcar operates and plans to operate in the future have been and may continue to be subject to political and economic
instability. 

We
currently conduct all of our business operations in India. Our growth strategy is premised on the rapid expansion of our platform into
emerging markets. Several of the countries in which we plan to operate our business in the future may be, subject to instances of political
instability, civil unrest, hostilities, terrorist activities and economic volatility. Any such events may lead to, among other things,
declines in Host and Guest demand for our platform, whether arising from safety concerns, a drop in consumer confidence, a general deterioration
of economic conditions, currency volatility, adverse changes to the political and regulatory environment, or otherwise. Any such developments
and any other forms of political or economic instability in our markets may harm our business, financial condition and operating results. 

We
are subject to risks associated with operating in rapidly evolving emerging markets. 

To
continue growing our business, we plan, in the future, to strengthen our operations and presence in India and to expand into other emerging
markets, which may include, without limitation, markets in Southeast Asia, Middle East/North Africa, and Latin America. We have limited
experience operating in jurisdictions outside India and plan to continue our efforts to expand into other jurisdictions. Business operations
in multiple jurisdictions and markets is difficult, time consuming and expensive, and any international expansion efforts that we may
undertake may not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to risks associated with operating in emerging
markets, including but not limited to the following: 

operational and compliance
 challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, including but not limited to the additional cost and resources
 required to localize our services, the translation of our mobile app, website and platform into foreign languages, and the adaptation
 of our operations to local cultures and practices, and any changes in such cultures and practices; 

unexpected and more restrictive
 laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, including those laws and regulations governing internet activities, peer-to-peer
 car sharing platforms, leasing or renting cars, insurance requirements, licensing and usage of vehicles, employment, tax, licensing
 and permitting, identify verification and screening, email and text messaging, collection and use of personal information, privacy
 and data protection, payment processing, currency regulation, auto insurance scores, or other third-party data sources for trust
 and safety screening purposes, and other activities important to our online business practices; 

105 

differing levels of technological
 compatibility with our platform and social acceptance of our brand and platform, and competition with companies that understand the
 local market better than we do or that have preexisting relationships with potential Hosts and Guests in those markets; 

legal uncertainty regarding
 our liability for the actions of Hosts and Guests, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or a lack of clear precedent
 of applicable law; 

dependency on third-party
 suppliers for the provision of essential business products/services including but not limited to IoT devices and software integrations
 in different jurisdictions. 

fluctuations in currency
 exchange rates; 

higher levels of credit
 risk and payment fraud; 

potentially adverse tax
 consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; 

increased financial accounting
 and reporting burdens, in addition to complexities and difficulties relating to the implementation and maintenance of adequate internal
 controls; 

difficulties in implementing
 and maintaining the financial systems and processes needed to enable compliance across multiple offerings and jurisdictions; 

public health concerns
 or emergencies, such as pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred
 in various parts of the world in which we operate; 

managing operations in
 markets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards; 

political, social, and
 economic instability abroad; 

terrorist attacks, including
 data breaches and security concerns; 

breakdowns in infrastructure,
 utilities, and other services; 

exposure to a business
 culture in which improper business practices may be prevalent; 

compliance with various
 anti-bribery laws; and 

reduced or varied protection
 of intellectual property rights in some countries. 

While
we believe that the present regulatory environment in our target markets is generally favorable, this could and may change over time.
If the regulatory environment in our target markets becomes more unfavorable for car sharing businesses, this could have a negative impact
on our operations in these markets and could adversely impact our ability to achieve sustainable profitability in these markets. 

Political
changes in the Government of India could delay or affect the further liberalization of the Indian economy and materially and adversely
affect economic conditions in India, generally, and our business, in particular. 

Our
business could be significantly influenced by economic policies adopted by the government of India. Since 1991, successive governments
have pursued policies of economic liberalization and financial sector reforms. The government has at various times announced its general
intention to continue India s current economic and financial liberalization and deregulation policies. However, protests against
such policies, which have occurred in the past, could slow the pace of liberalization and deregulation. The rate of economic liberalization
could change, and specific laws and policies affecting foreign investment, currency exchange rates and other matters affecting investment
in India could change as well. While we expect any new government to continue the liberalization of India s economic and financial
sectors and deregulation policies, there can be no assurance that such policies will be continued. 

106 

The
government of India has traditionally exercised and continues to exercise influence over many aspects of the economy. Our business may
be affected by interest rates, changes in policy, taxation, social and civil unrest and other political, economic or other developments
in or affecting India. 

A
change in the government s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could disrupt business and economic conditions in
India generally, and specifically our business and operations, as substantially all of our business and operations are located in India.
This could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 

We
may incur liability for the activities of Hosts or Guests, which could harm our reputation, increase our operating costs, and adversely
affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 

We
may be found to be subject to liability for the activities of Hosts and Guests on our platform. For example, we have in the past received,
and expect to continue to receive, complaints from Hosts regarding damage to, or loss, theft, or impounding of, their vehicles and requests
for damage reimbursement, and from Guests regarding quality or serviceability of the vehicles, other safety and security issues, and
actual or perceived discrimination in connection with Hosts declining trips and requests for reimbursement of their trip fees, as well
as actual or threatened legal action against us if no reimbursement or perceived incomplete reimbursement is made. In addition, some
of our Hosts may list or have listed vehicles on our platform in violation of their lease or financing agreements or personal automobile
insurance policies, or in violation of applicable legal restrictions on subleasing. Except for the examination of vehicle registration
certificates at the time of the Host onboarding and listing process, we do not screen vehicles for compliance with safety standards or
make efforts to determine whether they are legally registered to be driven on public roads, and it is possible that some vehicle registration
certificates may be forged, or some of our Hosts may list or have listed vehicles on our platform that fail to meet basic safety or legal
requirements for a vehicle. Our trust and safety checks and qualification procedures may not be capable of identifying all quality and
safety issues, including safety recalls, and our systems are not designed to identify legal, quality, and safety issues that may occur
after initial sign-up. Consequently, we could be and have been subject to liabilities incurred from local or state regulators and courts
regarding the activities of Hosts and Guests on our platform or related legal, safety, and security issues. 

If
we are found to be subject to liability or claims of liability relating to the acts of Hosts or Guests, or for failure to pay fees, fines,
or taxes owed by them, we may be subject to negative publicity or other reputational harm, even if we are not found to be subject to
such liability, and this may cause us to incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial
condition. 

Host,
Guest, or third-party actions that are criminal, violent, inappropriate, dangerous, or fraudulent may undermine the trust and safety
or perception of trust and safety of our marketplace and our ability to attract and retain Hosts and Guests, which could materially and
adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

We
have no control over or ability to predict the actions of our Hosts, Guests, and other third parties, such as additional passengers in,
or drivers of, vehicles booked on our platform, and we cannot guarantee the safety of our Hosts, Guests, and such third parties. From
time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings, including personal injury suits, claims, arbitrations, administrative proceedings,
and government investigations or enforcement actions in the ordinary course of business. The actions of Hosts, Guests, and other third
parties may result in fatalities, injuries, other bodily harm, assault, fraud, invasion of privacy, property damage, trespass, theft,
including cases in which we are unable to recover the vehicle, discrimination, harassment, and libel, among other negative impacts, which
could create potential legal or other substantial liabilities for us, Hosts, or Guests. For example, Hosts may incur and have incurred
liability due to the unlawful actions of their Guests or other third parties Guests allow in the vehicle, such as traffic violations
or other legal violations, and Guests may incur and have incurred liability due to the unlawful actions of their Hosts, such as vehicle
or registration violations. In addition, there have been rare instances where Guests were pulled over or detained by police because the
vehicles, they were driving had been reported as stolen by the vehicle owner. Depending on the circumstances, Hosts or Guests may also
attempt to assert liability on the part of Zoomcar for unlawful actions stemming from the use of vehicles available on our platform.
Such liabilities could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

107 

In
addition, we do not, and may not in the future, undertake to independently verify the safety, suitability, quality, and compliance with
our policies or standards of our Hosts vehicles. We have created policies and standards to respond to certain issues reported
with listings, but certain bookings may pose heightened safety risks to individual users because the underlying issues had never been
reported to us. We rely, at least in part, on Hosts and Guests to investigate and enforce many of our policies and standards and report
any issues with listings to us, and we cannot guarantee that they will do this promptly or accurately. 

Moreover,
we cannot conclusively verify the identity of all Guests, nor do we verify or screen third parties who may be present during a trip using
a vehicle booked through our platform. While we do some limited screening of Hosts, our trust and safety processes focus primarily on
Guests to reduce the risk of vehicle theft and motor vehicle accidents. Our identity verification processes rely on, among other things,
information provided by users at onboarding and booking, and our ability to validate that information and we do not require users to
re-verify their identity following their successful completion of the initial verification process or require Guests to provide documentation
or notification of any updates regarding their driving record or license status. We may not identify instances of identity fraud where
a Guest books a vehicle under another person s identity for criminal or other unlawful purposes. Furthermore, we do not conduct
criminal background checks or any other screening processes on Guests and their invitees in a vehicle booked through our platform. Given
this ambiguity or potential change, it is possible that we are not now, or may not be in the future, compliant with those laws. Further,
the use of criminal background checks or credit checks in our marketplace may open us up to allegations of discrimination. Therefore,
we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial
condition. 

Our
exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results
of operations. 

All
of our business is transacted and/or denominated in foreign currencies, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant
impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Increased currency volatility, particularly in the Indian Rupee,
could also positively or negatively impact our foreign-currency-denominated costs, assets and liabilities. In addition, any devaluation
of the Rupee relative to other foreign currencies could increase our operating expenses, adversely affecting the results of our operations.
Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and the results of our operations in the future. 

The
effective tax rates governing car rental and car subscription in India could change. 

The
tax environment continues to evolve in India on a routine basis and remains relatively fluid compared to other more mature markets. The
indirect tax rates associated with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) have changed on multiple occasions since the GST s introduction
in 2017. Any further increase in these indirect tax rates could result in a reduction in the Company s operating cash flow, which
could impair our future profitability. 

108 

The
Indian government could reduce highway infrastructure investments, thereby making car travel significantly less appealing. 

The
Indian government is currently investing significantly in expanding the country s underdeveloped network of interstate highways
and expressways. Compared to more mature markets, the Indian civil infrastructure is under-invested across its 28 states and 8 Union
territories. The development of new highways and expressways makes personal car transportation considerably more desirable, as new highway
infrastructure could potentially reduce travel time and overall traffic congestion. These new highways and expressways also have the
potential to mitigate low-speed vehicle intrusions on highways, which could potentially improve overall road safety. In the event that
the Indian government slows down this investment due to macroeconomic considerations, our business could observe a negative impact on
overall customer demand, which could reduce our future profitability. 

We
may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities. 

The
tax laws applicable to our business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be varied in the relevant jurisdictions. Like many
other multinational companies, we are subject to tax in diverse jurisdictions and have structured our business to reduce our effective
tax rate. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge
our methodologies for valuing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position
and operating results. Furthermore, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions
that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the
valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to
regular review and audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate, and currently face numerous income and other tax
claims pending appeals before higher authorities in India. Any adverse outcome of such appeals could have an adverse effect on our financial
position and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities
requires significant judgment by our management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains
uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial
results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore
we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future, which could impact our financial
position. 

Our
business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services. 

The
jurisdictions in which we operate and jurisdictions we may enter may have laws that govern payment and financial services activities.
These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering,
counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, and cyber-security of payment processes. Our business operations,
including our payments to Hosts and Guests, may not always comply with these financial laws and regulations. Regulators s may determine
that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in India.
We have evaluated and will continue to critically evaluate our options for seeking applicable licenses and approvals in the jurisdictions
where we operate to optimize our payment solutions and support the future growth of our business. Laws related to money transmission
and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform in
the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. 

Historical
or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture
of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm,
changes in compliance requirements, or limits on our ability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business. 

109 

Further,
our payment system may be susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent transactions,
and payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money
laundering and sanctions laws and conduct appropriate risk assessments and implement appropriate controls. Government authorities may
seek to bring legal action against us if our payment system is used for improper or illegal purposes or if our enterprise risk management
or controls are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented appropriately, and any such action could result in financial or reputational
harm to our business. 

Our
reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles. 

The
accounting for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution
of our business model, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in
SEC or other agency policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations, of accounting regulations. Changes to our business model and accounting
methods could result in changes to our financial statements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories
of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result in materially different financial results, and may require that we change
how we process, analyze, and report financial information and our financial reporting controls. 

We
are subject to privacy laws and regulations, and compliance with these laws and regulations could impose significant compliance burdens.

The
regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices
regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have
recently come under increased public scrutiny. The European Union s privacy and data security regulation, the General Data Protection
Regulation GDPR ), that went into effect in May 2018, requires companies to implement and remain compliant with
regulations regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to
correct or delete such data about themselves. Other countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America have passed or are considering similar
privacy regulations, resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted. 

We
receive, collect and store a large volume of personally identifiable data by processing car sharing transactions on our platform. This
data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. 

For
example, the Indian Information Technology Act, 2000, as amended, would subject us to civil liability to compensate for wrongful loss
or gain arising from any negligence by us in implementing and maintaining reasonable security practices and procedures with respect to
sensitive personal data or information that we possess in our computer systems, networks, databases and software. India has also implemented
privacy laws, including the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information)
Rules, 2011, which impose limitations and restrictions on the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. The Digital Personal
Data Protection Act, 2023 has been introduced in August of 2023 which has significant impact on the current regulatory environment with
respect to the lawful use of digital personal data, cross border data transfers and additional compliances that may be invoked for organizations
collecting and/or processing personal data. Since the legislation is fairly new and going through the phases of implementation right
now, it may affect us in ways that we are currently unable to predict. 

Any
liability we may incur for violation of such laws and regulations and related costs of compliance and other burdens may adversely affect
our business and profitability. We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business
practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business,
results of operations or financial condition. 

110 

Failure
to comply with labour laws and regulations may cause us to incur additional costs, which may affect our business, financial conditions
and results of operations. 

Our
business operations are governed by various labour laws, regulations and government policies in multiple jurisdictions. The requirements
for labour law compliance may change from time to time in each jurisdiction. We may be unable to comply with all these requirements in
time, or at all, or we may need to incur substantial costs to be compliant, which may adversely affect our business operations and financial
condition. 

For
example, in Egypt, an employer is required to deduct the relevant taxes from the salary of its employees and remit the same to the tax
authorities. Our Egypt subsidiary is currently in the process of remitting these taxes as deducted to the local tax authorities. Any
delay of remittance may make us susceptible to penalty, notice and administrative action from tax authorities. Our Egypt subsidiary is
also required to make social insurance registration with the local authorities and is currently in the process of registration. Any delay
or failure to register may subject us to penalties, notice and administrative action from relevant local authorities. 

In
India, provisions were released between 2019 and 2021 relating to the contribution of provident fund, employee state insurance, and professional
taxes by employers for the certain employees. Any delay or failure to make such contribution may result in penalties, interests, notices
or other administrative actions by the relevant local authorities in India. As of September 30, 2024, Zoomcar India has incurred a penalty
of less than 35,635/- (based on the foreign exchange rates as of March 31, 2024) for failure to make timely contribution, which Zoomcar
India plans to remit, with associated interest due, as instructed by the relevant local authority. This outstanding penalty and interest
will continue to accrue unless paid in full, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. 

Uncertain
global macro-economic and political conditions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our
results of operations could be materially affected by economic and political conditions in the United States and internationally, including
inflation, deflation, interest rates, availability of capital, war, terrorism, aging infrastructure, pandemics, energy and commodity
prices, trade laws, election cycles and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Current or potential business
and consumer members may delay or decrease spending on our products and services sold through our platform as their business and/or budgets
are impacted by economic conditions. The inability of current and potential business and consumer members to pay us for products and
services sold through our platform may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. 

Natural
disasters, including and not limited to unusual weather conditions, epidemic outbreaks, terrorist acts and political events could disrupt
our business schedule. 

The
occurrence of one or more natural disasters, including and not limited to tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods and earthquakes, unusual
weather conditions, pandemics and endemic outbreaks, terrorist attacks or disruptive political events in certain regions where our facilities
are located, or where our third-party contractors and suppliers facilities are located, could adversely affect our business.
Natural disasters including tornados, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes may damage our facilities or those of our suppliers, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks, actual or threatened
acts of war or the escalation of current hostilities, or any other military or trade disruptions impacting our domestic or foreign suppliers
of components of our products, may impact our operations by, among other things, causing supply chain disruptions and increases in commodity
prices, which could adversely affect our raw materials or transportation costs. These events also could cause or act to prolong an economic
recession in the United States or abroad. In addition, the disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently
are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses
as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans and, more generally, any of these events could
cause consumer/ member confidence and spending to decrease, which could adversely impact our operations. 

111 

We
may be unable to successfully grow our business if we fail to compete effectively with others to attract and retain our executive officers
and other key management and technical personnel. 

We
believe our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly competent personnel. Our employees are at-will and not
subject to employment contracts. We could potentially lose the services of any of our senior management personnel at any time due to
a variety of factors that could include, without limitation, death, incapacity, , personal issues, retirement, resignation or competing
employers. Our ability to execute current plans could be adversely affected by such a loss. We may fail to attract and retain qualified
technical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel required to continue to operate our business successfully. Personnel with the expertise
necessary for our business are scarce and competition for personnel with proper skills is intense. 

In
addition, new hires frequently require extensive training before they achieve desired levels of productivity. Additionally, attrition
in personnel can result from, among other things, changes related to acquisitions, retirement and disability. We may not be able to retain
existing key technical, sales, marketing and managerial employees or be successful in attracting, developing or retaining other highly
qualified technical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel, particularly at such times in the future as we may need to fill a key
position. If we are unable to continue to develop and retain existing executive officers or other key employees or are unsuccessful in
attracting new highly qualified employees, our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected. 

Risks
Related to Our Operations as a New Public Company 

The
requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert our management s attention and affect our ability to attract
and retain qualified independent board members. 

As
a public company, we are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing requirements
of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act ). Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase
our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems
and resources, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. Among other things,
the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and
maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to improve our disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight
may be required. As a result, the management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Although we have already hired additional personnel to help comply with these
requirements, we may need to further expand our legal and finance departments in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses. 

In
addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for
public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations
and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application
in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty
regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to
invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative
expense and a diversion of management s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our
efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory
authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business and prospects may be harmed. As a result of disclosure of information
in the filings required of a public company and in this quarterly report, our business and financial condition will become more visible,
which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful,
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed, and even if the claims do not result
in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources
of our management and materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

112 

We
may have increasing difficulty attracting and retaining qualified outside independent board members. 

The
directors and management of publicly traded corporations are increasingly concerned with the extent of their personal exposure to lawsuits
and shareholder claims, as well as governmental and creditor claims that may be made against them in connection with their positions
with publicly held companies. Outside directors are becoming increasingly concerned with the availability of directors and officers 
liability insurance to pay on a timely basis the costs incurred in defending shareholder claims. Directors and officers 
liability insurance is expensive and difficult to obtain. Accordingly, it may become increasingly difficult to attract and retain qualified
outside directors to serve on our Board. 

Stock
trading volatility could impact our ability to recruit and retain employees. 

Volatility or lack of appreciation
in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the
shares they own or the shares underlying their vested equity have not significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase
price of the shares or the exercise price of the options, or conversely, if the exercise price of the options that they hold are significantly
above the market price of our Common Stock. If we are unable to retain our employees, or if we need to increase our compensation expenses
to retain our employees, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. 

Members
of our management team have limited or no prior experience managing a public company. 

Except
a few, most of the members of our senior management team have no experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public
company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully
or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company, which will subject us to significant regulatory oversight and reporting
obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts, investors and regulators. These new
obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from
the day-to-day management of our business, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

We
are an Emerging Growth Company, making comparisons to non-Emerging Growth companies difficult or impossible. 

We
are an Emerging Growth Company EGC as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), and we have taken and expect to continue to take advantage of
certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not EGCs including, but
not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced
disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, registrations statements and proxy statements, and exemptions
from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute
payments not previously approved. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts EGCs from being required to comply with new or revised
financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared
effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial
accounting standards. This exemption may make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies that are neither EGCs
nor EGCs that have opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in
accounting standards used. 

We
may be exposed to risk if we cannot enhance, maintain, and adhere to our internal controls and procedures. 

As
a public company trading on Nasdaq, we have significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls. The process
of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that will require us to anticipate and react to changes
in our business accounting, auditing and regulatory requirements and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal
controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company, and we are still early in the process of generating
a mature system of internal controls and integration across business systems. If we are unable to establish or maintain appropriate internal
financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations on a timely basis, result in
material misstatements in our financial statements, and harm our operating results. 

113 

Matters
impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information in an accurate manner or on a timely basis
and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of Nasdaq rules. There also could
be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements.
Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements could also suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm
continue to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect us and
lead to a decline in the market price of our Common Stock. 

As
a public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased expenses associated with the costs of being a public company. 

We
have and expect to continue to face a significant increase in insurance, legal, auditing, accounting, administrative and other costs
and expenses as a public company that we did not currently incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the requirements
of Section 404 of that Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB ),
the SEC and Nasdaq, impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. Compliance with public company requirements
has and will continue to increase our costs and make certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements require us
to carry out activities that we have not done previously. For example, we recently created new board committees and adopted new internal
controls and disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, additional expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements have and
will continue to be incurred. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified (for example, if our independent
registered accounting firm identifies a material weakness or significant deficiency in the internal control over financial reporting),
we could incur additional costs to remediate those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect our reputation or
investor perceptions of it. Being a public company has and may in the future make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain
types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance. We may ultimately be forced to accept reduced policy limits and
coverage with increased self-retention risk or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage in the future.
Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our Common Stock, fines,
sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation. 

The
additional reporting and other obligations imposed by various rules and regulations applicable to public companies has and is expected
to continue to increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, auditing, accounting and administrative
activities. These increased costs will require us to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise be used to expand the
business and achieve strategic objectives. Advocacy efforts by shareholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance
and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs. 

Our
current indebtedness, and to the extent we incur indebtedness in the future, our future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial
condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react
to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments. 

We
are in default of a majority of our indebtedness of 38.95 million as of September 30, 2024 as more fully described under the Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited), which has had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our financial condition,
our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, and our ability to operate our business. Further, in the future, we may
continue to incur a material amount of indebtedness. Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate
cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on, or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness. Our leverage and debt service
obligations could adversely impact our business, including by: 

impairing our ability to
 generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal, including periodic principal payments; 

increasing our vulnerability
 to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 

114 

requiring the dedication
 of a portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other
 purposes, including capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders or to pursue future business opportunities; 

requiring us to sell debt
 or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations; 

limiting our flexibility
 in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete; and 

placing us at a possible
 competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources. 

Any
of the foregoing factors could have negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Zoomcar
has no operating history as a publicly traded company, and its historical financial information is not necessarily representative of
the results we would have achieved as a publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results. 

The
historical financial information included in this quarterly report from Zoomcar s operation as a private company prior to the Business
Combination does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position we would have achieved as a publicly traded
company during the periods presented, or those that we will achieve in the future. This is primarily because of the following factors: 

Prior to the Business Combination,
 we operated as a private company. Our historical financial information reflects allocations of corporate expenses as a private company.
 These allocations may not reflect the costs we will incur for similar services in the future as a publicly traded company. 

Our historical financial
 information does not reflect changes that we expect to experience in the future as a result of becoming a publicly traded company,
 including changes in the financing, insurance, cash management, operations, cost structure and personnel needs of our business. As
 a publicly traded entity, we may be unable to purchase goods, services and technologies, such as insurance and health care benefits
 and computer software licenses, or access capital markets, on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained as a private company
 prior to the Business Combination, and our results of operations may be adversely affected. 

We
also face additional costs and demands on management s time associated with being a publicly traded company, including costs and
demands related to corporate governance, investor and public relations and public reporting. Stockholder activism, the current political
and social environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations
and disclosure obligations, which will likely result in additional compliance costs and could impact the manner in which Zoomcar operates
its business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. For additional information about our past financial performance, see Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited) and the Notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report filing. 

The
Company may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management s attention. 

Following
the Business Combination, the per share price of the Common Stock has been and may continue to be volatile and, in the past, companies
that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities litigation, including class action
litigation. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any adverse determination in litigation
could also subject the Company to significant liabilities. 

115 

Risks
Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 

Future
sales of our Common Stock could cause the market price for our Common Stock to decline. 

We
cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our Common Stock or the availability of shares of our Common Stock,
including upon exercise or conversion of any of our outstanding securities, for sale will have on the market price of our Common Stock
prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amount of shares of our Common Stock on the public market, or the perception that
those sales will occur, including sales pursuant to this quarterly report, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline
or be depressed. 

As
described elsewhere herein, we expect to issue additional securities imminently to raise capital to continue our operations. Additionally,
we may issue our securities if we need to raise capital in connection with capital expenditure, working capital requirement or acquisition.
The number of shares of our Common Stock issued in connection with a capital expenditure, working capital requirement or acquisition
could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of Common Stock. Any perceived excess in the supply of our shares
in the market could negatively impact our share price and any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions
may result in additional dilution to you. 

The
market price and trading volume of our Common Stock may continue to be highly volatile, which could lead to a loss of all or part of
a stockholder s investment. 

The
market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated widely since the closing of our Business Combination. During the period from January
1, 2024, to October 23, 2024, the trading price of our Common Stock has fluctuated from an intra-day high of 761.00 on January 12, 2024,
to an intra-day low of 5.72 on October 22, 2024. 

The
market price of our Common Stock is affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to: 

our ability to execute
 our anticipated business plans and strategy; 

actual or anticipated fluctuations
 in our quarterly or annual operating results; 

our ability to obtain additional
 capital which will be necessary to continue our business and operations; 

changes in financial or
 operational estimates or projections; 

changes in the economic
 performance or market valuations of companies similar to ours; 

the impact of pandemics,
 inflation, war, other hostilities and other disruptive events on our business or that of our customers, partners, and supply chain
 or on the global economy; and 

our ability to comply with
 the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq and maintain our listing on Nasdaq. 

In
addition, the trading price and trading volume of our Common Stock has very recently and at certain other times in the past exhibited,
and may continue to exhibit, extreme volatility, including within a single trading day. Such volatility could cause purchasers of our
Common Stock to incur substantial losses. For example, on May 23, 2024, the trading price of our Common Stock ranged from an intra-day
high of 44.00 to an intra-day low of 22.00, on trading volume of approximately 1.15 million shares, and on March 19, 2024, the
trading price of our Common Stock ranged from an intra-day high of 183.00 to an intra-day low of 90.10, on trading volume of
approximately 290 thousand shares. With respect to certain such instances of trading volatility, we are not aware of any material
changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume, which we believe
reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our operating business or prospects and outside of our control. We are thus unable to
predict when such instances of trading volatility will occur or how long such dynamics may last. Under these circumstances, we would
caution you against investing in our Common Stock unless you are prepared to incur the risk of incurring substantial losses. 

A proportion of our Common Stock may be traded by short sellers, which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our Common Stock,
creating further price volatility. In particular, a possible short squeeze due to a sudden increase in demand of our Common
Stock that largely exceeds supply may lead to sudden extreme price volatility in our Common Stock. Investors may purchase our Common Stock
to hedge existing exposure in our Common Stock or to speculate on the price of our Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Common
Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of Common Stock available
for purchase in the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase our Common Stock for delivery to
lenders of our Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn dramatically increase the price of our Common Stock until investors with short
exposure are able to purchase additional Common Stock to cover their short position. This is often referred to as a short squeeze. 
Following such a short squeeze, once investors purchase the shares necessary to cover their short position, the price of our Common Stock
may rapidly decline. A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in our shares that are not directly correlated to the performance
or prospects of our company and could cause purchasers of our common shares to incur substantial losses. 

116 

Further,
shareholders may institute securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities
litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources, and the attention of management could be diverted from our business. 

Our
issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financing, acquisitions, investments, the Incentive Plan or otherwise will dilute
all other stockholders. 

We
expect to issue additional capital stock in the immediate future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to
grant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under the Incentive Plan. We may also raise capital through equity financing
in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies
and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders
to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our Common Stock to decline. 

There
can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. 

Our
continued eligibility to maintain the listing of our Common Stock and Public Warrants on Nasdaq depends on a number of factors, including
the price of our Common Stock and Public Warrants and the number of persons that hold our Common Stock and Public Warrants. On May 6,
2024, the Company received two letters from the Nasdaq staff indicating that the Company no longer complies with (i) Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A)
as it relates to the requirement to maintain a minimum market value of listed securities of 50,000,000 and (ii) Listing Rule 5450(a)(1)
as it relates to the requirement to maintain minimum bid price of 1 per share. Further to this, on November 8, 2024, the Company received
a notice from NASDAQ stating that, since the closing bid price over the 12 consecutive days between October 22, 2024, and November 6,
2024, has been 1.00 per share or greater, the Company is now in compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and, hence, has resolved this
matter. 

However,
the market value of listed securities of the Company did not close at 50,000,000 or more for ten consecutive business days prior
to November 4, 2024. The Company failed to regain the compliance with the minimum market value requirement within the stipulated timeframe
and thus, it received a staff delist determination letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department on November 6, 2024, for
its failure under the MVLS as well as MVPHS Rules (defined below). The Company intends to timely request a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings
Panel. This hearing request will automatically stay Nasdaq s delisting of the Company s Common Stock and warrants pending
the Panel s decision and any extension provided by the Panel. The Company has retained Donohoe Advisory Associates LLC to assist
the Company in its preparation for the hearing and developing its compliance plan. The Company intends to present its plan of compliance,
which may include a transfer to the Nasdaq Capital Market listing tier. 

Further,
on July 22, 2024, the Company received another notice from the Nasdaq staff notifying the Company that, based on the market value of
publicly held shares for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the listing of the Company s listed securities was not in compliance
with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) (the MVPHS Rule to maintain a minimum market value of publicly held shares of 15,000,000.
To regain compliance, the minimum market value of publicly held shares must close at 15,000,000 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business
days during this 180-day compliance period. If the Company does not regain compliance with the MVPHS Rule within the 180-day compliance
period, it may transfer the listing of its securities to the Nasdaq Capital Market which has a reduced compliance standard under
the MVPHS Rule, provided the Company will only be able to transfer the listing to the Nasdaq Capital Market if the Company then
meets the continued listing requirements on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As of the date hereof, the Company does not meet the continued
listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market as the Company is not in Compliance of the , the minimum market value of listed securities
requirement of 35,000,000 or the minimum stockholders equity requirement of 2,500,000. 

On
October 29, 2024, the Company received a deficiency notice from the Nasdaq Staff indicating that the Company s publicly held shares
are below the 1,100,000 share minimum requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(1)(B)
(the MPLS Requirement ). The notification states that the Company has 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance with
the MPLS Requirement for continued listing. If Nasdaq accepts the Company s plan, Nasdaq may grant the Company an extension of
up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notification to evidence compliance with the MPLS Requirement. If Nasdaq does not accept
the Company s plan, the Company will have the opportunity to appeal the decision in front of a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. However,
there can be no assurance that, if the Company does appeal the delisting determination by Nasdaq to the panel, that such appeal would
be successful. Alternatively, the Company may apply to transfer the Company s securities to the Nasdaq Capital Market which has
a reduced compliance standard under the MPLS Rule, provided the Company will only be able to transfer the listing to the Nasdaq Capital
Market if the Company then meets the continued listing requirements on the Nasdaq Capital Market and pays an application fee of 5,000. 

117 

Subsequently, on November 4, 2024, the Company received another notice
indicating non-compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum of 1.1 million publicly held shares under Rule 5450(b)(1)(B). This
led Nasdaq, on November 6, 2024, to issue a delisting determination letter due to the Company s ongoing non-compliance with the
MVLS Rule and additional listing requirements. On November 5, 2024, the Company had entered into a private placement transaction for gross
proceeds of 9.15 million. On November 7, 2024, the Company closed private placement financing pursuant to the above agreement, through
which it raised gross proceeds of approximately 9.15 million, in lieu of which the Company has \ issued 1,302,850 Common Stock. Post
such issue of Common Stock, the Company will be compliant of the requirement of maintaining 1.1 million publicly held shares and the matter
will be resolved.

If
Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet its listing standards, and we are not able to list such
securities on another national securities exchange, then our Common Stock could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were
to occur, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

a limited availability
 of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity for our
 securities; 

a determination that the
 Common Stock is a penny stock, which will require brokers trading the Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules,
 possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for shares of Common Stock; 

a limited amount of news
 and analyst coverage; and 

a
decreased ability for us to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they
change their recommendations regarding our securities adversely, the price and trading volume of our securities could decline. 

The
trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about
us, our business, markets, revenue streams, and competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish
research on us. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, our share price and trading volume would likely be negatively
impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our shares of Common Stock or provide
relatively more favorable recommendations with respect to competitors, the price of our shares of Common Stock would likely decline.
If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in
the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. 

We
do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. 

We
currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the further development and expansion of our business and do not intend
to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and
will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and future agreements and financing instruments,
business prospects and such other factors as our Board deems relevant. 

118 

Because
there are no current plans to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on your
investment unless you sell your Common Stock at a price greater than what you paid for it. 

We
intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and there are no current plans to pay any
cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of our Common Stock
will be at the sole discretion of the Board. The Board may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition
and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and
regulatory restrictions, implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other
factors as the Board may deem relevant. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in the Common Stock unless you sell
your Common Stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. 

Our
warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. 

In connection with the Business
Combination, we assumed from IOAC, 11,500,000 Public Warrants to purchase 115,000 shares of our Common Stock, each Public Warrant
exercisable into one hundredth of one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of 571.00 per full share. In addition,
as a result of the Business Combination we issued warrants to the Legacy Zoomcar warrant holders. As of the date of this filing,
there are 380,011 of such warrants outstanding, each exercisable to purchase one share of Common Stock at 300 per share. Further, in
June 2024, we issued warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock which such warrants are exercisable beginning on December
20, 2024, at an initial exercise price of 14.16 per share, subject to an alternative cashless exercise and other adjustments and resets
as described herein. Among the adjustments and resets included in the June Warrants are price based anti-dilution protection and adjustments
following a Share Combination Event, including the Reverse Split, in each case based, in part, on the lowest volume weighted average
price during the five trading days after such event., Assuming the lowest volume weighted average price of the Common Stock since
the Reverse Split on October 23 of 5.9161, there would be June Warrants to purchase 1,267,728 shares of Common Stock at an exercise
price of 5.9161.The Company has also issued warrants to the placement agent in connection with the June 2024 offering which such
warrants are substantially similar to the June Warrants. Such warrants are also subject to adjustment as a result of the Reverse
Split and will be exercisable into 50,710 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of 5.9161 based on the October 23 volume
weighted average price. All such warrants, other than potentially the June Warrants and placement agent warrants which have been
reset on October 29, 2024 following the Company s Reverse Stock Split, are out of the money as of the date hereof, but such
warrants, when and if exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock and may reduce the value
of the Common Stock. 

Future
sales , or the perception of future sales, by us or our stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for the Common
Stock to decline. 

The
sale of shares of our Common Stock on the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market
price of shares of Common Stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us
to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that it deems appropriate. 

As
on October 31, 2024, we have a total of 757,494 shares of Common Stock outstanding (i) without giving effect to any awards that
may be issued under the Incentive Plan and (iii) assuming no exercise of the outstanding warrants. All shares currently held by public
stockholders and all of the shares issued in the Business Combination to former Zoomcar Stockholders are freely tradable without registration
under the Securities Act, and without restriction by persons other than our affiliates (as defined under Rule 144 under
the Securities Act, Rule 144 )), including our directors, executive officers and other affiliates. 

119 

Simultaneously
with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, certain stockholders of Zoomcar, Inc., who collectively owned approximately
35.0 of the outstanding Zoomcar, Inc. preferred stock and Common Stock at the time of the execution of the Merger Agreement (on an as
converted to Common Stock basis), entered into the Lock-Up Agreements with IOAC. Pursuant to the Lock-Up Agreements, such Zoomcar stockholders
agreed to subject certain shares of Common Stock held by them to the restrictions described below from the Closing until the termination
of applicable lock-up periods described below. Each Zoomcar stockholder party to the Lock-Up Agreements agreed not to, without the prior
written consent of the Zoomcar Board and subject to certain exceptions, during the applicable lock-up period: (i) lend, sell, offer to
sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer, dispose of
or agree to transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease
a call equivalent position within the meaning of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, any
shares of Common Stock held by it immediately after the Closing or issued or issuable to it in connection with the Merger (including
Common Stock acquired as part of any financing agreements or issued in exchange for, or on conversion or exercise of, any securities
issued as part of any financing agreements), any shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Common
Stock held by it immediately after the Closing, or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock held
by it immediately after the Closing (collectively, the BC Lock-Up Shares (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement
that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any of the BC Lock-Up Shares, whether
any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise; or (iii) publicly announce any intention
to effect any transaction specified in the foregoing clauses. Pursuant to the BC Lock-Up Agreement, IOAC and certain Zoomcar stockholders
agreed to the foregoing transfer restrictions during the period beginning on the date of Closing and ending (a) (i) as to 1/3 of the
shares, six months after Closing, (ii) as to 1/3 of the shares, nine months after Closing and (iii) as to 1/3 of the shares, one
year after the Closing or (b) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization
or other similar transactions that result in all of the Company s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares
for cash, securities or other property. 

In
addition, the shares of Common Stock reserved for future issuance under the Incentive Plan will become eligible for sale in the public
market once those shares are issued, subject to any applicable vesting requirements, lock-up agreements and other restrictions imposed
by law. A total of 196,954 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for future issuance under the Incentive Plan. We intend to file
a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Incentive Plan. Accordingly, shares to be registered under such a registration statement
will be available for sale in the open market upon the effectiveness of the registration statement. 

In
the future, we may also issue our securities to raise capital or in connection with investments or acquisitions. For example, on June
18, 2024, we closed a private placement transaction of notes and warrants for 3 million of gross proceeds. The amount of shares of Common
Stock issued or issuable upon exercise or conversion of securities issued in connection with a capital raise or an investment or acquisition
could constitute a material portion of the then-outstanding shares of the Common Stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection
with capital raising activities, investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to our stockholders.
