Revenues 

In-person experience revenues
increased by approximately 0.2 million, or 20 , to approximately 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately
 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of in-person experience revenues was driven by a 0.2 million
increase in arena and truck event revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from an increase in revenue earned
per event held during the period. 

Casual mobile gaming revenue
was 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.
The increase in casual mobile games revenue was due to the casual mobile gaming revenue recognized in the current year as a result of
the business combination with ZTech on October 31, 2023. 

Costs and expenses 

In-person costs (exclusive
of depreciation and amortization) increased by approximately 0.1 million, or 19 , to approximately 0.7 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is the result of
the increase in costs associated with the arena and truck events for the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from an increase
in costs per event held during the period. 

Casual mobile gaming costs
(exclusive of depreciation and amortization) were 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.0 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The recognition of casual gaming costs and expenses began in connection with the

million, or 47 , to approximately 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 0.9 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in
payroll and payroll related costs resulting from a 1.5 million Employee Retention Credit ERC received and recorded as
a reduction of expense during the three months ended September 30, 2023, a 0.2 million increase in payroll due to the hiring of our new
president during the second quarter of 2024, and a 0.2 million increase in stock-based compensation related to restricted share awards
granted on February 22, 2024. These increases were slightly offset by a) a 1.3 million decrease in legal and professional fees resulting
from (i) an insurance reimbursement of second quarter 2024 defense costs incurred in connection with a shareholder complaint filed in
March 2024, and (ii) costs related to various merger and acquisition activities during the third quarter of 2023, and b) a 0.2 million
decrease in insurance costs related to a D O insurance policy that was renewed at a lower cost in August 2023. 

Depreciation and amortization increased by approximately 0.2 million,
or 68 to approximately 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 0.2 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the amortization of intangibles that were recorded as part of the business
combination with ZTech on October 31, 2023. 

Other income (expense), net 

We recognized other expense,
net, of approximately 1 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 thousand of other expense recorded
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Loss on escrow settlement 

We recognized a loss in connection
with a Settlement and Release Agreement dated September 16, 2024, with Brookfield Property Partners Brookfield ), under
which 3.0 million was released and paid to Brookfield from an escrow account established in January 2020 (see Note 8 Commitments
and Contingencies Investment Agreement). The entire escrow account of 5.0 million was included in restricted cash on the
condensed consolidated balance sheets since that date. 

Loss on foreign currency transactions 

The loss on foreign currency
transactions was approximately 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.0 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase is a result of changes in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen to United States Dollar between
the dates certain loans payable were borrowed, the dates certain loans receivable were issued, and the dates certain equity linked notes were purchased and September 30, 2024. 

Interest income, net 

Interest income, net, was
approximately 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 0.7 million of interest income for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is a result of the interest earned on certificates of deposit purchased during
the fourth quarter of 2023, in addition to equity linked notes purchased in the third quarter of 2024.

Revenues 

In-person experience revenues
decreased by approximately 0.1 million, or 2 , to approximately 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately
 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of in-person experience revenues was driven by a 0.1 million
decrease in truck event revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from fewer events held during the period. 

Multiplatform content revenue
was 0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
was due to Season 2 of Elevated, a live streaming event, that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and did not occur
in 2024. 

Casual mobile gaming revenue
was 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.
The increase in casual mobile games revenue was due to the casual mobile gaming revenue recognized in the current year as a result of
the business combination with ZTech on October 31, 2023. 

26 

Costs and expenses 

In-person costs (exclusive
of depreciation and amortization) decreased by approximately 0.1 million, or 4 , to approximately 1.8 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 from approximately 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is the result of the decrease
in costs associated with the truck events for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from fewer events held during the period. 

Multiplatform costs (exclusive
of depreciation and amortization) decreased by approximately 1.5 million to 0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
from approximately 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in multiplatform costs corresponds to the
decrease in revenues, as discussed above. 

Casual mobile gaming costs
(exclusive of depreciation and amortization) were 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.0 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The recognition of casual mobile gaming costs and expenses began in connection with
the business combination with ZTech on October 31, 2023. 

Research and development
expenses were 527 thousand and 0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Research and development
expenses consist principally of costs related to the development of new casual mobile games for ZTech. 

Selling and marketing expenses
increased by approximately 25 thousand, or 14 , to approximately 198 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately
 173 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

General and administrative
expenses increased by approximately 3.7 million, or 66 , to approximately 9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
from approximately 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses resulted
primarily from a 2.1 million increase in legal and professional fees related to a shareholder complaint filed in 2024, a 1.3 million
increase in payroll and payroll related costs due to an Employee Retention Credit ERC received and recorded as a reduction
of expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and a 0.8 million increase in stock-based compensation related to restricted
share awards granted on February 22, 2024. These increases were slightly offset by a 0.2 million decrease in payroll and payroll related
costs in 2024 due to a decrease in headcount, in addition to a 0.3 million decrease in insurance costs related to a D O insurance
policy that was renewed at a lower cost in August 2023. 

Depreciation and amortization
increased by approximately 152 thousand, or 15 , to approximately 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately
 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the depreciation and amortization of fixed
assets and intangibles that were part of the business combination in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Other income (expense), net 

We recognized 0 thousand
in other expense, net, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 16 thousand of other income recorded for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Loss on escrow settlement 

We recognized a loss in connection
with a Settlement and Release Agreement dated September 16, 2024, with Brookfield Property Partners Brookfield ), under
which 3.0 million was released and paid to Brookfield from an escrow account established in January 2020 (see Note 8 Commitments
and Contingencies Investment Agreement). The entire escrow account of 5.0 million was included in restricted cash on the
condensed consolidated balance sheets since that date. 

Loss on foreign currency transactions 

The loss on foreign
currency transactions was approximately 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.0 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is a result of changes in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen to United States
Dollar between the dates certain loans payable were borrowed, the dates certain loans receivable were issued, and the dates certain
equity linked notes were purchased and September 30, 2024. 

Interest income, net 

Interest income, net, was
approximately 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 2.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The increase is a result of the interest earned on certificates of deposit purchased during the fourth quarter of
2023, loans receivable issued in 2024, and equity linked and Fx notes purchased in 2024. This was slightly offset by interest expense
of 0.04 million on loans borrowed during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the nine month period ended September 30, 2024.

used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine

of common stock in a share purchase agreement of 2 million, offset by the 2 million return of proceeds upon cancellation of common
stock previously issued. Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 represented the purchase
of treasury stock. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company does not engage
in any off-balance sheet financing activities, nor does the Company have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

We prepare our condensed
consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require our management to make
estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance
sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material
differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our
estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our circumstances
and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. 

We consider an accounting
estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the
time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or
use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition
or results of operations. We consider accounting for goodwill impairment to be a critical accounting estimate. There are additional items
within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical, as defined above. 

29 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, under the
direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as such terms are defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation
our management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in
our Exchange Act reports was recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Even assuming the effectiveness
of our controls and procedures, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect
that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error or all fraud. A control
system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s
objectives will be met. In general, our controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that our control system s
objective will be met, and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur
or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls
can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the
controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of
any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

During the quarter ended
September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

30 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

We may be subject to litigation
from stockholders, suppliers and other third parties from time to time. Such litigation may have an adverse impact on our business and
results of operations, may be costly to defend, or may cause disruptions to our operations. As discussed in more detail below, Knighted
Pastures, LLC Knighted recently filed a complaint against, among other defendants, us and the members of our Board of
Directors. We are incurring additional costs to defend such litigation and it may continue to cause our management to divert attention
and resources from our business operations. In addition, the complaint states that Knighted seeks to nominate directors to AGAE s
Board and effect certain changes with respect to the business and management of AGAE. In the event directors nominated by Knighted are
elected to our board of directors, such directors may disagree with the strategic direction of the Company or otherwise take actions
that may adversely affect the interest of our shareholders. 

Knighted Pastures, LLC 

On March 7, 2024, Knighted
Pastures, LLC Knighted ), an AGAE stockholder, filed a complaint captioned Knighted Pastures, LLC v. Yangyang Li, et
al. , C.A. No. 2024-0222 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against us, the members of our Board of Directors, and
certain additional defendants (the Knighted Action ). The complaint alleges, among other things, that the members of our
Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duty in connection with (1) the approval of a Share Purchase Agreement that AGAE entered
into on or around December 28, 2023, (2) the approval and adoption of certain amendments to AGAE s Bylaws on or around January
5, 2024, and (3) the approval and adoption of a rights agreement on or around February 8, 2024. The Knighted Action sought both injunctive
reliefs and money damages. 

On June 20, 2024, following
expedited discovery and entry of resolutions by the Board of Directors addressing issues raised by the Knighted Action, the Court of
Chancery entered an Order granting in part the Company and Board of Directors motion to dismiss the Knighted Action as moot. The
Court therefore cancelled the trial in the Knighted Action. The Court ordered the parties to submit further filings on Knighted s
claim for attorneys fees and costs and any other issues required to bring the Knighted Action to a final conclusion. On August
2, 2024, Knighted filed a motion for an attorney s fee award based on the purported corporate benefit its case provided to the
Company and its other shareholders. The Company intends to oppose the motion in its entirety. 

On August 28, 2024, the
Court granted Knighted an attorney s fee award of 3.0 million which was paid on September 11, 2024. On October 31, 2024, the Company
received reimbursement of legal costs from the directors and officers insurance carrier of 3.7 million. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

In addition to the other
information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the Risk Factors in the Company s
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our other public filings, which could materially affect our business, financial
condition or future results. 

Our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions
of activist stockholders or others. 

We are subject to actions
and proposals from stockholders and others that do not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders.
Responding to such actions is costly and time-consuming, disrupts our business and operations and diverts the attention of our board of
directors, management and employees from the pursuit of our business strategies. Such activities interferes with our ability to execute
our strategic plan. Activist stockholders or others may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy
which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and potential customers,
and may affect our relationships with current customers, vendors, investors and other third parties. In addition, Knighted Pastures LLC
has initiated a proxy contest for the election of directors at our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders which has required us to incur
significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and our board of directors.
The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also could affect the market price and volatility of our securities.
