 -61-

 Section 2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans . 
 (a) Each Term Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of SOFR Loans shall be made upon the Borrower s irrevocable written notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, to the Administrative Agent. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A , (i) in the case of a SOFR Loan, not later than noon, New York City time, three (3) U.S. Government Securities Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (ii) in the case of a Base Rate Loan, not later than noon, New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the proposed Borrowing provided that, with respect to a Borrowing of Delayed Draw Term Loans, notice must be received not later than noon, New York City time, seven (7) Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans shall be in a principal amount of the Borrowing Minimum or a whole multiple of the Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof. Each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of the Borrowing Minimum or a whole multiple of the Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof. Each Committed Loan Notice shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Term Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of SOFR Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the Class and principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Loans are to be converted, (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto and (vi) the location and number of the Borrower s account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.02(b) . If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or fail to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion or continuation shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable SOFR Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of SOFR Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month. For the 
 -62- 

avoidance of doubt, the Borrower and Lenders acknowledge and agree that any conversion or continuation of an existing Loan shall be deemed to be a continuation of that Loan with a converted interest rate methodology and not a new Loan. 
 (b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Class of Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Appropriate Lender of the details of any automatic conversion or continuation described in Section 2.02(a) . In the case of each Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make (or cause its Applicable Lending Office to make) the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent by wire transfer in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent s Office not later than 1 00 p.m., New York City time on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01 ), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower as designated in the Committed Loan Notice in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent and designated by the Borrower in the Committed Loan Notice with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower. 
 (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a SOFR Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such SOFR Loan unless the Borrower pays the amount due, if any, under Section 3.04 in connection therewith. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Required Lenders may require that (i) no Loans may be converted to or continued as SOFR Loans, and (ii) unless repaid, each SOFR Loan shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. 
 (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for SOFR Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of the SOFR by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. 
 (e) Anything in clauses (a) to (d) above to the contrary notwithstanding, after giving effect to all Term Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than five (5) Interest Periods in effect at any time for all Borrowings of SOFR Loans. 
 (f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing, or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 1 00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of such Borrowing, that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s Applicable Percentage of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such Applicable Percentage available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with clause 
 (b) above, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds available, then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, each of such Lender and the Borrower severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower 
 
 -63- 

until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (a) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing (but shall not be required to make any payment pursuant to Section 3.04 with regard to such repayment) and (b) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the foregoing. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.02(f) shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. If the Borrower and such Lender shall both pay all or any portion of the principal amount in respect of such Borrowing or interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such Borrowing or interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender (but not Borrower) pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
 Section 2.03 Prepayments . 
 (a) Optional Prepayments . 
 (i) The Borrower may, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay any Borrowing of any Class in whole or in part without premium or penalty (except as set forth in Section 2.03(e) provided that (1) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1 00 p.m., New York City time (A) three (3) U.S. Government Securities Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of SOFR Loans and (B) one Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans and (2) any prepayment of SOFR Loans shall be in a principal amount of 1,000,000, or a whole multiple of the Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof, or the entire principal amount of such Borrowing then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Class(es) and Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender s Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a SOFR Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.04 . Each prepayment of the Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(a) shall be applied to the installments thereof as directed by the Borrower (it being understood and agreed that if the Borrower does not so direct at the time of such prepayment, such prepayment shall be applied against the scheduled repayments of Term Loans of the relevant Class under Section 2.05 in the indirect order of maturity) and shall be paid to the Appropriate Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages. 
 (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Borrower may rescind any notice of prepayment under Section 2.03(a) if such prepayment would have resulted from a refinancing of the applicable Facility, which refinancing shall not be consummated or shall otherwise be delayed.

 (b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be provided that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of SOFR Loans to be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. 
 (c) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then 
 (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, then the applicable Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, it being understood that nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Term Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder and 
 (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the Compensation Period at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at the interest rate applicable to such Loan. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Term Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.10(c) shall be conclusive, absent demonstrable error.

(d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 
 (e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation. 
 (f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
 (g) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in Section 8.04 . If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender s Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time. 
 Section 2.11 Sharing of Payments . If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them provided that (x) if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon and (y) the provisions of this Section 2.11 shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.11 may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 10.09 with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of 
 -76- 

the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of demonstrable error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.11 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations so purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased. 
 Section 2.12 Incremental Credit Extensions . 
 (a) Until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date and so long as (x) the Delayed Draw Term Commitments have been fully funded prior to, or at the time of, the addition of any Incremental Facility and (y) the Incremental Term Loan Conditions shall have been satisfied, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (whereupon the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders), request to increase the amount of Term Loans or add one or more additional tranches of term loans (any such Term Loans or additional tranche of term loans, the Incremental Term Loans ). Notwithstanding anything to contrary herein, the aggregate amount of all Incremental Facilities (determined at the time of incurrence) shall not exceed 
 100,000,000. Each Incremental Facility shall be in an integral multiple of 1,000,000 and be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than 10,000,000, provided that such amount may be less than the applicable minimum amount if such amount represents all the remaining availability hereunder as set forth above or is incurred in connection with a Permitted Acquisition. Each Incremental Facility shall have the same guarantees as, and be secured on a pari passu basis by the same Collateral securing, all of the other Obligations under this Agreement. 
 (b) Any Incremental Term Loans (i) for purposes of prepayments, shall be treated substantially the same as (and in any event no more favorably than) the then-existing Term Loans, (ii) shall have interest rate margins and (subject to clauses (iii) and (iv) amortization schedule as determined by the Borrower and the lenders thereunder provided that, if the Applicable Rate (which, for such purposes only, shall be deemed to include all upfront or similar fees or original issue discount (with original issue discount being equated to interest based on an assumed four-year life to maturity) payable to all lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans (but excluding customary arrangement or commitment fees payable to any arranger or bookrunner or their Affiliates in connection therewith)) relating to any Incremental Term Loan exceeds the Applicable Rate (which, for such purposes only, shall be deemed to include all upfront or similar fees or original issue discount (with original issue discount being equated to interest based on an assumed four-year life to maturity) payable to all Lenders providing the then-existing Term Loans (but excluding customary arrangement or commitment fees payable to any arranger, bookrunner or agent or their Affiliates in connection therewith)) relating to any then-existing Term Loans immediately prior to the effectiveness of the applicable Incremental Facility Amendment by more than 0.50 , the Applicable Rate relating to such Term Loans shall be adjusted to be equal to the Applicable Rate (which, for such purposes only, shall be deemed to include all upfront or similar fees or original issue discount (with original issue discount being equated to interest based on an assumed four-year life to maturity) payable to all lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans (but excluding customary arrangement or commitment fees payable to any arranger or bookrunner or their Affiliates in connection therewith)) relating to such Incremental Term Loans minus 0.50 provided that, if the Incremental Term Loans include an interest rate floor greater than the applicable interest rate floor under such Term 
 -77- 

Loans, such differential between interest rate floors shall be equated to the Applicable Rate for purposes of determining whether an increase to the Applicable Rate under such Term Loans shall be required, but only to the extent an increase in the interest rate floor in such Term Loans would cause an increase in the interest rate then in effect thereunder, and in such case the interest rate floor (but not the Applicable Rate) applicable to such Term Loans shall be increased to the extent of such differential between interest rate floors), (iii) any Incremental Term Loan shall not have a final maturity date earlier than the Maturity Date applicable to the then-existing Term Loans, (iv) any Incremental Term Loan shall not have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity that is shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the then-existing Term Loans, (v) any Incremental Term Loans shall be secured only by the Collateral on an equal priority basis, (vi) except as otherwise required or as permitted in clauses (i) through (v) above, the other terms of any Incremental Term Loans shall be on terms and pursuant to documentation to be determined by the Borrower and the Lenders and or the Additional Lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans and shall, at all times prior to the Latest Maturity Date then in effect at the time of such incurrence, be substantially consistent with the terms of then-existing Term Loans provided that such terms may be inconsistent with the terms of the then existing Term Loans if reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (it being understood that no consent shall be required from the Administrative Agent for terms or conditions that are more restrictive than the terms or conditions of the then-existing Term Loans if the Lenders receive the benefit of such terms or conditions through their addition to the then-existing Term Loans or to the extent that they apply solely to periods following the Maturity Date with respect to the then-existing Term Loans) and 
 (vii) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or if the proceeds of such Incremental 
 Facility are to be used, in whole or in part, to finance a Permitted Acquisition, no Default or Event of Default shall result therefrom). 
 (c) Each notice from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms of the relevant Incremental Term Loans. Any additional bank, financial institution, existing Lender or other Person that elects to extend Incremental Term Loans shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (any such bank, financial institution, existing Lender or other Person being called an Additional Lender and, if not already a Lender, shall become a Lender under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (an Incremental Facility Amendment to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, such Additional Lender and the Administrative Agent provided that no Incremental Term Loans may be provided by an Affiliated Lender unless, after giving effect to such Incremental Term Loans, the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all Term Loans that are held by Affiliated Lenders (other than Affiliated Debt Funds) does not exceed 25 of the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Term Loans then outstanding. Existing Lenders as of such time shall first be offered an opportunity to provide or participate in such additional tranches of loans or increases to existing tranches of loans on a pro rata basis (or less than pro rata basis at the election of each existing Lender) provided, that each existing such Lender shall, to the extent that it intends to provide or participate in such additional tranches of loans or increases to existing tranches of loans, respond as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Borrower makes such offer to such Lender (and if no such response is received by the Borrower within such period, such Lender will be deemed to have declined the opportunity to provide or participate in such additional tranches of loans or increases to existing tranches of loans). No Lender shall be obligated to provide any Incremental Term Loans, unless it so agrees. Term Commitments in respect of any Incremental Term Loans may become Term Commitments under this Agreement. An Incremental Facility Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to any Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.12 . The effectiveness of any 
 -78- 

Incremental Facility Amendment shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent and the Additional Lenders, be subject to the satisfaction on the date thereof (each, an Incremental Facility Closing Date of each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (it being understood that all references to the date of such Credit Extension in Section 4.02 shall be deemed to refer to the Incremental Facility Closing Date). 
 Section 2.13 Defaulting Lenders . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Term Commitment and Outstanding Amount of Term Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.01 provided that any waiver, amendment or modification of a type described in clause (a) , (b) or (c) of the first proviso in Section 10.01 that would apply to the Term Commitments or Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender with respect to the effectiveness of such waiver, amendment or modification with respect to the Term Commitments or Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender.

 (a) Except as provided in this Section 3.01 , any and all payments by the Borrower or any Guarantor to or for the account of any Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes unless required by applicable Law. If any applicable Withholding Agent shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Agent or any Lender, (i) if such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Borrower or applicable Guarantor shall be increased as necessary so that after all required deductions have been made (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01 ), each of such Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such applicable Withholding Agent shall make such deductions, 
 (iii) such applicable Withholding Agent shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within thirty 
 (30) days after the date of such payment by such applicable Withholding Agent (or, if receipts or evidence are not available within thirty (30) days, as soon as possible thereafter), such applicable Withholding Agent shall furnish to the Borrower and such Agent or Lender (as the case may be) the original or a facsimile copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
 (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay all Other Taxes. 
 (c) Without duplication of any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01(a) or Section 3.01(b) , the Borrower agrees to indemnify each Agent and each Lender for any reasonable expenses arising from the Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes or with respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Body. Such Agent or Lender, as the case may be, will, at the Borrower s request, (A) provide the Borrower with a written statement thereof setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of such amounts or (B) have the 
 -79- 

(d) amount of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes verified by an independent accountant selected by such Agent or Lender. Payment under this Section 3.01(c) shall be made within ten

Such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, shall, at the Borrower s request, provide the Borrower with a copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence of the requirement to repay such refund received from the relevant taxing authority provided that such Lender or Agent may delete any information therein that such Lender or Agent deems confidential). Nothing herein contained shall interfere with the right of a Lender or Agent to arrange its Tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit nor oblige any Lender or Agent to claim any Tax refund or to make available its Tax returns or disclose any information relating to its Tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof or require any Lender or Agent to do anything that would prejudice its ability to benefit from any other refunds, credits, reliefs, remissions or repayments to which it may be entitled. 
 (f) Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 3.01(a) or (c) with respect to such Lender it will, if requested by the Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts (subject to legal and regulatory restrictions), at Borrower s expense, to designate another Applicable Lending Office for any Loan affected by such event provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in the judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its Applicable Lending Office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided further that nothing in this Section 3.01(e) shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Section 3.01(a) or (c) . 
 (g) Each Lender shall, at such times as are reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with any documentation prescribed by law, or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, certifying as to any entitlement of such Lender to an exemption from, or reduction in, any withholding Tax with respect to any payments to be made to such Lender under any Loan Document. Each such Lender shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders such documentation (including any documentation specifically referenced below) expired, obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, deliver promptly to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new 
 (h) 
 -80- 

documentation reasonably requested by the applicable Withholding Agent) or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its inability to do so. 
 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing 
 (i) Each Lender that is a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding 
 (ii) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter when required by Law or upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) whichever of the following is applicable

 (E) two duly completed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable 
 U.S. federal income tax laws (including the Treasury regulations) as a basis for 
 -81-

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause (f) , a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause (g) , the Administrative Agent shall not be required to deliver any form that such Administrative Agent is not legally eligible to deliver. 
 Section 3.02 Inability to Determine Rates Alternative Rate of Interest . Subject to Section 3.09 , if, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any SOFR Loan 
 (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Adjusted Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof, or 
 (b) the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a SOFR Loan or a conversion thereto or a continuation thereof that Adjusted Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making and maintaining such Loan, and the Required Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. 
 Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to continue SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent (with respect to clause (b), at the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such 
 -82- 

request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. Upon any such conversion, the Loan Parties shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.04 . Subject to Section 3.09 , if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Adjusted Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any given day, the interest rate on Base Rate Loans shall be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate until the Administrative Agent revokes such determination. 
 Section 3.03 Increased Cost and Reduced Return Capital Adequacy Reserves on SOFR Loans . 
 (a) If any Lender determines that as a result of any Change in Law, or such Lender s compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Loan, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this Section 3.03(a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes indemnifiable under Section 3.01 , (ii) Excluded Taxes or (iii) reserve requirements contemplated by Section 3.03(c) or included in determining the Reserve Percentage), then from time to time within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail such increased costs (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.05 ), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction provided that in the case of any Change in Law only applicable as a result of the proviso set forth in the definition thereof, such Lender will only be compensated for such amounts that would have otherwise been imposed under the applicable increased cost provisions and only to the extent the applicable Lender is imposing such charges on other similarly situated borrowers under comparable syndicated credit facilities. 
 (b) If any Lender determines that as a result of any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender s obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender s desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.05 ), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such demand. 
 (c) The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves (other than reserves taken into account in the calculation of the Reserve Percentage) with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each SOFR Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Term Commitments or the funding of the 
 -83- 

SOFR Loans (other than reserves taken into account in the calculation of the Reserve Percentage), such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Term Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error) which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have received at least fifteen (15) days prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or cost from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice fifteen (15) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or cost shall be due and payable fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice. 
 (d) Subject to Section 3.05(b) , failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 3.03 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation. 
 (e) If any Lender requests compensation under this Section 3.03 then such Lender will, if requested by the Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to designate another Applicable Lending Office for any Loan affected by such event provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its Applicable Lending Office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage and provided , further , that nothing in this Section 3.03(e) shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Section 3.03(a) , (b) , (c) or (d) .

A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
 Section 3.05 Matters Applicable to All Requests for Compensation .

If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor agent from among the Lenders.

Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent hereunder by a successor and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto, and such amendments or supplements to the Mortgages, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may reasonably request, in order to (a) continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the Collateral Documents or (b) otherwise ensure that the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement is satisfied, the Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges, and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent shall, to the extent not previously discharged, be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents.

In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that would vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) in the asset or assets so purchased (or in the Equity Interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such purchase). In connection with any such bid (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles to make a bid, (ii) to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or Equity Interests thereof shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by the vote of the Required Lenders, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in clauses (a) through (f) of Section 10.01 of this Agreement), (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to assign the relevant Obligations to any such acquisition vehicle pro rata by the Lenders, as a result of which each of the Lenders shall be deemed to have received a pro rata portion of any Equity Interests and or debt instruments issued by such an acquisition vehicle on account of the assignment of the Obligations to be credit bid, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and 
 (iv) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire 
 Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of debt credit bid by the acquisition 
 
 -138- 

vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Lenders pro rata and the Equity Interests and or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of the Obligations that had been assigned to the acquisition vehicle shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. 
 Section 9.11 Collateral and Guaranty Matters . The Lenders irrevocably agree 
 (a) that any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document shall be automatically released (i) upon termination of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations not yet accrued and payable), (ii) at the time the property subject to such Lien is transferred or to be transferred as part of or in connection with any transfer permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document to any Person other than any other Loan Party, unless a primary purpose of such transaction (as determined by the Borrower in good faith) was to release such Subsidiary Loan Party from its obligations under the Loan Documents, (iii) subject to Section 10.01 , if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, (iv) if the property subject to such Lien is owned by a Guarantor, upon release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guaranty pursuant to clause (c) below or (v) if the property subject to such Lien becomes Excluded Property

 Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section 9.11 . In each case as specified in this Section 9.11 , the Administrative Agent will promptly (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrower s expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release or subordination of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents, or to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 9.11 . Prior to releasing or subordinating its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section 9.11 , the Administrative Agent and or the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to receive a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower stating that such actions are permitted under this

 Section 9.13 Appointment of Supplemental Administrative Agents . 
 (a) It is the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall be no violation of any Law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to transact business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case the Administrative Agent deems that by reason of any present or future Law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to appoint an additional individual or institution selected by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion as a separate trustee, co-trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent, administrative sub-agent or administrative co-agent (any such additional individual or institution being referred to herein individually as a Supplemental Administrative Agent and, collectively, as Supplemental Administrative Agents ). 
 (b) In the event that the Administrative Agent appoints a Supplemental Administrative Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right, power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to the Administrative Agent with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and vest in such Supplemental Administrative Agent to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Administrative Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance thereof by such Supplemental Administrative Agent shall run to and be enforceable by either the Administrative Agent or such Supplemental Administrative Agent, and (ii) the provisions of this Article IX and of Section 10.04 and Section 10.05 that refer to the Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of such 
 -140- 

Supplemental Administrative Agent and all references therein to the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be references to the Administrative Agent and or such Supplemental Administrative Agent, as the context may require. 
 (c) Should any instrument in writing from any Loan Party be required by any Supplemental Administrative Agent so appointed by the Administrative Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, the Borrower shall, or shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent. In case any Supplemental Administrative Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Administrative Agent, to the extent permitted by Law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental Administrative Agent. 
 Section 9.14 Withholding Tax . To the extent required by any applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may deduct or withhold from any payment to any Lender under any Loan Document an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Body asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, and shall make payable in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefore including any penalties, additions to Tax or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Body. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.14 . The agreements in this Section 9.14 shall survive the resignation and or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of this Agreement and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other obligations.

A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Payment Recipient under this clause (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If a Payment Recipient receives any payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise and does not receive a corresponding payment notice or payment advice, such payment, prepayment or repayment shall be presumed to be in error absent written confirmation from the Administrative Agent to the contrary. 
 (b) Each Lender or Secured Party hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or Secured Party under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender or Secured Party from any source, against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under immediately preceding clause (a) or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement.

 (d) The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower or any other Loan Party for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment. 
 (e) No Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine. 
 (f) Each party s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 9.15 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the
