ending , with annual escalations. In April 2024, the Company its previous lease agreement for its Tokyo office, effective October 2024, and in May 2024, the Company entered into a new lease agreement, effective June 2024, for a different office space for its Tokyo location. The new lease has an initial lease term of ending with an option to extend for an additional , after which there will be automatic renewals until the lease is terminated. In measuring the lease liability, the Company determined that it was renewal option. Accordingly, the Company used a lease term of in measuring the lease liability. The Company measured the lease liability based on the present value of the future lease payments, including the one extension option that is reasonably certain to exercise, discounted using the estimated incremental borrowing rate of , which is the interest rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments at initial commencement. The real estate operating leases are included in Right-of-use asset on the Company's balance sheets and represents the Company s right to use the underlying assets for the lease term. The Company s obligation to make lease payments are included in "Operating lease liability" and "Other non-current liabilities" on the Company's balance sheets.

Product Liability The Company s business exposes it to liability risks from its potential drug products. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against the Company could result in the payment of significant amounts of money and divert management s attention from running the business. The Company may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or the insurance may not provide adequate protection in the case of a product liability claim. To the extent that product liability insurance, if available, does not cover potential claims, the Company would be required to self-insure the risks associated with such claims. The Company believes it carries reasonably adequate insurance for product liability. License and Research Agreements The Company has entered into in-licensing agreements with various pharmaceutical companies. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company has received licenses to research, know-how and technology claimed in specified patents or patent applications. Under these license agreements, the Company is generally required to make upfront payments and additional payments upon the achievement of milestones and/or royalties on future sales of products until the later of the expiration of the applicable patent or the applicable last date of market exclusivity after the first commercial sale, on a country-by-country basis. milestone payments have been made under these agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For products currently in development, future potential milestone payments based on product development of MN-166 (ibudilast) and MN-001 (tipelukast) ar e m illion as of September 30, 2024. For all other products, future potential milestone payments related to development milestones and commercialization milestones total ed mil lion as of September 30, 2024. There are no minimum royalties required under any of the license agreements. The Company is unable to estimate with certainty the timing on when these milestone payments will occur as these payments are dependent upon the progress of the Company s product development programs. Legal Proceedings From time to time, the Company may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The Company is not aware of any such proceedings or claims that it believes will have, individually or in aggregate, a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.

shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2013 Plan. In addition, returning shares that may become available from time to time were added back to the 2013 Plan. Returning shares included shares that were subject to outstanding awards granted under the Company's prior 2004 Equity Incentive Plan that expired or terminated prior to exercise or settlement, were forfeited because of the failure to vest, were repurchased, or were withheld to satisfy tax withholding or purchase price obligations in connection with such awards. Although the Company no longer grants equity awards under the 2013 Plan, all outstanding stock awards granted under the 2013 Plan will continue to be subject to the terms and conditions as set forth in the agreements evidencing such stock awards and the terms of the 2013 Plan. In June 2023, the Company adopted the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (2023 Plan) under which the Company may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other awards to individuals who are then employees, officers, non-employee directors or consultants of the Company or its subsidiaries. The 2023 Plan is the successor to the 2013 Plan. The number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2023 Plan is equal to the sum of (a) shares subject to awards granted under the 2013 Plan that were outstanding upon expiration of the 2013 Plan and are subsequently forfeited, expire or lapse unexercised or unsettled and shares issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2013 Plan that were outstanding upon expiration of the 2013 Plan and are subsequently forfeited to or reacquired by the Company and (b) shares reserved under the 2013 Plan that were not issued or subject to outstanding awards under the 2013 Plan upon expiration of the 2013 Plan. While a maximum of shares may become available for issuance under the 2023 Plan from the 2013 Plan, since this figure assumes that all awards outstanding under the 2013 Plan upon expiration of the 2013 Plan will be forfeited, the Company expects the actual number of shares added to the 2023 Plan to be less. In general, to the extent that awards under the 2023 Plan are forfeited, cancelled or expire for any reason before being exercised or settled in full, the shares subject to such awards will again become available for issuance under the 2023 Plan. If stock appreciation rights are exercised or restricted stock units are settled, then only the number of shares (if any) actually issued to the participant will reduce the number of shares available under the 2023 Plan. If restricted shares or shares issued upon exercise of options are reacquired by the Company pursuant to a forfeiture provision, repurchase right or for any other reason, then such shares shall again become available for issuance under the 2023 Plan. Shares withheld to pay the exercise price of options or satisfy tax withholding obligations related to an award shall again become available for issuance under the 2023 Plan. Further, to the extent an award is settled in cash rather than shares, the cash settlement shall not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the 2023 Plan. As of September 30, 2024, shares remain available for future grants under the 2023 Plan. Certain of the employee stock options granted contain performance conditions, the vesting of which is based on a determination made by the compensation committee followed by an approval of the board of directors as to the achievement of certain corporate objectives at the end of the performance period. The grant date of such awards is the date on which the board of directors makes its determination. For periods preceding the grant date, the expense related to these awards is measured based on their fair value at each reporting date. The estimated fair value of the performance awards granted and the resulting expense is based upon a certain level of achievement of the corporate objectives and other assumptions in determining fair value. The amount of expense ultimately recognized upon the grant date at completion of the performance period could change from the estimate as a result of various factors, including the level of achievement of the corporate objectives, changes in the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model in determining fair value or fluctuations in the Company s stock price during the performance period. As of September 30, 2024, there were a total o f 8 s hares underlying performance options that were subject to vesting based on achievement of corporate objectives for 2024. Stock Options Options granted under the 2023 Plan and the 2013 Plan have terms of from the date of grant unless earlier terminated and generally vest over a one or period. The exercise price of all options granted through September 30, 2024 and 2023, was equal to the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.

Such compensation cost will ultimately be adjusted based upon actual performance compared to the corporate objectives as described above.

Subsequent Events On November 11, 2024, the Company was notified by Sanofi that the Sanofi/Novartis litigation (as defined below) was settled. As a result of the settlement, if Genzyme Corporation Genzyme recovers any monetary damages, by way of settlement or otherwise, as a result of the litigation, then the Company is entitled to receive a portion of such monetary damages from Genzyme, pursuant to the terms of that certain assignment agreement between the Company (as successor in interest to Avigen, Inc.), and Genzyme dated December 19, 2005 (the Genzyme Assignment Agreement ). The amount of monetary damages the Company expects to receive cannot be reasonably estimated. On March 30, 2022, the Company was notified that Genzyme, a subsidiary of Sanofi, filed its First Amended Complaint, which included a claim for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 9,051,542, on February 23, 2022 in a lawsuit previously filed against Novartis Gene Therapies, Inc., Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation, and Novartis AG in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (collectively, the Sanofi/Novartis litigation ). This patent, among others was included in the Genzyme Assignment Agreement. In the litigation, the plaintiffs alleged that Novartis infringed certain U.S. patents through the unauthorized manufacture, use, and sale of recombinant adenoassociated virus vectors for their gene therapy drug Zolgensma.

Our current strategy is to focus our development activities on MN-166 (ibudilast) for neurological and other disorders such as progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, degenerative cervical myelopathy, glioblastoma, substance dependence and addiction (e.g., methamphetamine dependence, opioid dependence, and alcohol dependence), prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and Long COVID, and MN-001 (tipelukast) for fibrotic and other diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Our pipeline also includes MN-221 (bedoradrine) for the treatment of acute exacerbation of asthma and MN-029 (denibulin) for solid tumor cancers. We were incorporated in Delaware in September 2000. 
 We have incurred significant net losses since our inception. As of September 30, 2024, from inception, our accumulated deficit was 423.9 million. We expect to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we continue to develop certain of our existing product development programs, and over the long-term if we expand our research and development programs and acquire or in-license products, technologies or businesses that are complementary to our own. 
 Our goal is to build a sustainable biopharmaceutical business through the successful development of differentiated products for the treatment of serious diseases with unmet medical needs in high-value therapeutic areas. Key elements of our strategy are as follows: 
 Pursue the development of MN-166 (ibudilast) for multiple potential indications with the support of non-dilutive financings. 

We intend to advance our diverse MN-166 (ibudilast) program through a combination of investigator-sponsored clinical trials, trials funded through government grants or other grants, and trials funded by us. We intend to pursue additional strategic alliances to help support further clinical development of MN-166 (ibudilast). 
 Pursue the development of MN-001 (tipelukast) for fibrotic and other diseases. 

We intend to advance development of MN-001 (tipelukast) through a variety of means, which may include investigator-sponsored trials with or without grant funding as well as trials funded by us. 
 Consider strategic partnerships with one or more leading pharmaceutical companies to complete product development and successfully commercialize our products. 

We develop and maintain relationships with pharmaceutical companies that are therapeutic category leaders. We intend to discuss strategic alliances with leading pharmaceutical companies who seek product candidates, such as MN-166 (ibudilast), MN-001 (tipelukast), MN-221 (bedoradrine), and MN-029 (denibulin), which could support our clinical development and product commercialization.

Impact of COVID-19 and the Macroeconomic Environment on Our Business 
 The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant national and global economic disruption and has, and may continue to adversely affect our business. To date, we have experienced certain adverse effects on our business as well as been provided certain opportunities as a result of the pandemic. The pandemic caused a decrease in the number of patient visits at some clinical trial sites which we believe resulted in slower enrollment in our clinical trials than would have occurred without the pandemic. However, we have seen an increase in the number of patient visits compared to earlier in the pandemic and we continue to enroll patients in clinical trials. Throughout the pandemic, we continued with routine clinical trial activities including executing new clinical trial agreements, negotiating budgets, institutional review board approvals, site training, and other activities related to the initiation of new clinical trials and the opening of new clinical trial sites, although some of these activities took longer to complete than what we experienced prior to the pandemic. 
 The pandemic created certain opportunities for our clinical development and we have pursued those opportunities. Following the outbreak of the pandemic, we designed a clinical trial to evaluate MN-166 (ibudilast) for prevention of ARDS caused by COVID-19. In June 2022, we announced positive top-line results from this Phase 2 clinical trial in which MN-166 (ibudilast) demonstrated large improvements compared to placebo for all four clinical endpoints analyzed. Separately, in August 2022, we announced plans to participate in Recovering from COVID-19 Lingering Symptoms Adaptive Integrative Medicine Trial (the RECLAIM trial), a grant-funded clinical trial to evaluate MN-166 (ibudilast) and other therapies for the treatment of Long COVID, the lingering symptoms of COVID-19. In February 2023, we announced that Health Canada completed its review of the clinical trial application and granted authorization to commence the RECLAIM trial. 
 We continue to actively monitor the possible effects on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce resulting from the recent pandemic and the macroeconomic environment. To the extent that there is a resurgence in the COVID-19 pandemic, or other health epidemics or outbreaks, our operations could be disrupted and our business adversely impacted. 
 Further, certain global COVID-19 pandemic and government responses to the pandemic resulted in, and may continue to result in, downward pressure, extreme volatility, and disruptions in the capital and credit markets, reducing our ability to raise additional capital through equity, equity-linked or debt financings, which could negatively impact our short-term and long-term liquidity, access to capital markets, and our ability to operate in accordance with our operating plan, or at all. 
 In addition, we may be exposed to credit risk on deposits at financial institutions to the extent our account balances exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We are monitoring ongoing events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions. 
 Research, Development and Patents Expenses 
 Our research, development and patents expenses consist primarily of license fees related to our product candidates, salaries and related employee benefits, costs associated with the preclinical and clinical development of our product development programs, costs associated with non-clinical activities, such as regulatory expenses, and pre-commercialization manufacturing development activities. We use external service providers to manufacture our compounds to be used in clinical trials and for the majority of the services performed in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Research, development and patents expenses include fees paid to consultants, contract research organizations, contract manufacturers and other external service providers, including professional fees and costs associated with legal services, patents and patent applications for our intellectual property. Internal research and development expenses include costs of compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel, supplies, facility costs and depreciation. Research, development and patents costs are expensed as incurred and we expect to increase such costs through the remainder of 2024 as our development programs progress.

The following table summarizes our research, development and patents expenses for the periods indicated for each of our product development programs. To the extent that costs, including personnel costs, are not tracked to a specific product development program, such costs are included in the Other R D expense category (in thousands):

General and Administrative Expenses 
 Our general and administrative costs primarily consist of salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and consulting and professional fees related to our administrative, finance, human resources, business development, legal, information systems support functions, facilities and insurance costs. General and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Our general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods if we are required to expand our infrastructure based on the success of our product development programs and in raising capital to support our product development programs or otherwise in connection with increased business development activities related to partnering, out-licensing or product disposition. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances at the time the estimates are made, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the book values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. 
 Our critical accounting policies are those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. For a description of our critical accounting estimates, please see the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have not been any material changes to the critical accounting policies discussed therein during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 IPR D and Goodwill 
 Amounts incurred related to in-process research and development (IPR D) or asset purchases of IPR D are expensed as incurred. Amounts allocated to IPR D in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value and are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they will not be amortized but will be tested annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually (as of December 31st) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. 
 19 

As of December 31, 2023, the Company performed a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets which included an evaluation of changes in industry, market, and macroeconomic conditions as well as consideration of its financial performance and any significant trends. The qualitative assessment indicated that it was not more likely than not that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired as of December 31, 2023. If the Company experiences a sustained decline in its stock price or other material changes in the significant assumptions that affect the determination of the fair value of the Company s single reporting unit, it may result in a goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charge in future periods, and such charge may be material. 
 Results of Operations 
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenues 
 Revenues were 0.0 million and 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 1.0 million was due to the receipt of a milestone payment under the Genzyme Agreement in September 2023. 
 
 Research, Development and Patents Expenses 
 
 Research, development and patents expenses were 1.9 million and 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 1.1 million was primarily driven by an increase in ALS related expenses and new drug safety tests for MN-166 and MRC-001, respectively. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, we received a 0.7 million payment from BARDA to partially reimburse us for pre-clinical study costs, which was recorded as an offset to MN-166 research and development expense. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses were 1.5 million and 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 0.1 million was primarily driven by increases in performance-based stock option expense and increases in professional fees, partially offset by a reduction in headcount. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income was 0.4 million and 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments. 
 
 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenues 
 Revenues were 0.0 million and 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 1.0 million was due to the receipt of a milestone payment under the Genzyme Agreement in September 2023. 
 
 Research, Development and Patents Expenses 
 
 Research, development and patents expenses were 5.3 million and 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 1.3 million was primarily due to an increase in MN-166 manufacturing costs. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received a 0.7 million payment from BARDA to partially reimburse us for pre-clinical study costs, which was recorded as an offset to MN-166 research and development expense. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses were 4.2 million and 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 0.2 million was primarily driven by a decrease in performance-based stock option expense partially offset by an increase in professional fees. 
 20 

Interest Income 
 Interest income was 1.3 million and 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 0.1 million was primarily driven by lower interest rates on available cash in 2024 compared to cash and bank certificates of deposit in 2023. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.7 million compared to 6.9 million during the same period in 2023. The 1.8 million change is primarily related to the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets for those periods, combined with a larger net loss primarily due to no revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.0 million compared to 39.9 million provided by during the same period in 2023 related to the disposal of certificates of deposit of 39.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had available cash and cash equivalents of 42.3 million and working capital of 40.7 million. As of the date of this report, we believe we have working capital sufficient to fund operations at least through the end of 2025. However, we cannot provide assurance that these capital resources will be sufficient to conduct all our research and development programs as planned. 
 Equity Financing 
 In August 2019, we entered into an at the market issuance sales agreement, which was amended on August 26, 2022 (as amended, the ATM Agreement) with B. Riley FBR, Inc. (B. Riley FBR) pursuant to which we may sell common stock through B. Riley FBR from time to time up to an aggregate offering price of 75.0 million. Sales of our common stock through B. Riley FBR, if any, will be made by any method that is deemed to be an at-the-market equity offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on Nasdaq, on any other existing trading market for the common stock or through a market maker. B. Riley FBR may also sell the common stock in privately negotiated transactions, subject to our prior approval. We agreed to pay B. Riley FBR an aggregate commission rate of up to 3.5 of the gross proceeds of any common stock sold under this agreement. Proceeds from sales of common stock will depend on the number of shares of common stock sold to B. Riley FBR and the per share purchase price of each transaction. 
 No shares of common stock were sold under the ATM Agreement in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Not applicable. 
 ITEM 4.	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
