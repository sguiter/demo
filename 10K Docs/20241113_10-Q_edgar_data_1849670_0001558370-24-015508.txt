 In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. ASU 2024-03 requires public companies to disclose, in the notes to the financial statements, specific information about certain costs and expenses at each interim and annual reporting period. This includes disclosing amounts related to employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. In addition, public companies will need to provide qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. ASU 2024-03 is effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Implementation of ASU 2024-03 may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2024-03 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ) Corporate bonds ) Treasury securities Mortgage-backed securities Collateralized mortgage obligations ) Total available-for-sale debt securities ) Equity securities: Mutual funds (fixed income)

There were private label mortgage-backed securities or collateralized mortgage obligations held in the securities portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, agency bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and corporate bonds were in an unrealized loss position. In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, management considers whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred and industry analysts reports. As of September 30, 2024, management believes that the estimated fair value of securities disclosed above is primarily dependent upon the movement in market interest rates particularly given the negligible inherent credit risk associated with these securities. Although the fair value will fluctuate as the market interest rates move, management believes that these fair values will recover as the underlying portfolios mature and are reinvested in market yielding investments. Additionally, all securities remain highly rated and all issuers have continued to make timely payments of interest and principal. As the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company concluded that a credit loss did not exist in its portfolio at September 30, 2024, and therefore, allowance for credit losses was recorded.

 Commercial Construction Commercial and industrial Consumer and other Total A loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard loans include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific allowance for credit losses is not warranted. Loans that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention by our management. Loans that are performing as agreed are classified as pass .

The Company may modify loans through rate reductions, extensions of maturity, interest only payments, or payment modifications to better match the timing of cash flows due under the modified terms with the cash flows from the borrowers operations. Loan modifications are intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral. The Company identifies loans for potential modification primarily through direct communication with the borrower and evaluation of the borrower s financial statements, revenue projections, tax returns, and credit reports. Even if the borrower is not presently in default, management will consider the likelihood that cash flow shortages, adverse economic conditions, and negative trends may result in a payment default in the near future. loans were modified during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company closely monitors the performance of modified loans to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts. Upon the determination that all or a portion of a modified loan is uncollectible, that amount is charged against the allowance for credit losses. There were payment defaults during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of modified loans.

Overview Our business has traditionally focused on originating fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans and offering retail deposit accounts. In September 2019, we hired our current president and chief executive officer, Janak M. Amin, and under his leadership team we have developed a commercial lending infrastructure, with a particular focus on expanding our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loan portfolios to diversify our balance sheet, improve our interest rate risk exposure and increase interest income. Our primary market area now consists of Chester and Lancaster Counties and the surrounding Pennsylvania counties of Cumberland, Dauphin, and Lebanon. Management has also emphasized the importance of attracting commercial deposit accounts from its customers. As a result of these initiatives and the completion of our initial public stock offering on July 14, 2021, we were able to grow and strengthen our balance sheet. There was an increase in our consolidated assets of 13.1 million, or 3.0 , from 439.7 million at December 31, 2023 to 452.8 million at September 30, 2024 and an increase in our deposits of 21.8 million, or 6.6 , from 333.0 million at December 31, 2023 to 354.8 million at September 30, 2024. Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income and, to a lesser extent, noninterest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest- earning assets, consisting primarily of loans, debt securities and other interest-earning assets (primarily cash and cash equivalents), and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of savings accounts, demand accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit and borrowings. Noninterest income consists primarily of debit card income, service charges on deposit accounts, earnings on bank owned life insurance, other service charges and other income. Our results of operations also are affected by our provision for credit losses and noninterest expenses. Noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data and item processing costs, advertising and marketing, professional fees, directors fees, FDIC insurance premiums, Pennsylvania shares tax, debit card expenses, and other expenses. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported net income of 404,000 compared to net income of 513,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The period over period decrease in earnings of 109,000 was attributable 

 31 

Table of Contents 
 to a decrease in net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by an increase in noninterest income and decreases in provision for credit losses and income tax expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported net income of 1.1 million compared to net income of 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The period over period decrease in earnings of 419,000 was attributable to a decrease in net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by an increase in noninterest income and decreases in provision for credit losses and income tax expense. Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting estimates discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. In 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Allowance for credit losses on loans. We establish the allowance for credit losses through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the estimated net realizable value or fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent, when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for credit losses ACL at September 30, 2024 represents the Company s current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from its loan portfolio. Management estimates the ACL by projecting a lifetime loss rate conditional on a forecast of economic parameters and other qualitative adjustments, for the loans expected remaining term. Management s judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of historical loan losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts relevant to the collectability of loans. In addition, management s estimate of expected credit losses is based on the cash flows over the remaining life of loans held for investment, and changes in expected prepayment behavior may result in changes in the remaining life of loans and expected credit losses. The allowance may be affected materially by a variety of qualitative factors that the Company considers to reflect its current judgement of various events and risks that are not measured in our statistical procedures. These qualitative risk factors include: (1) lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices; (2) national, regional, and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various market segments, including the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans; (3) nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans; (4) volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as loan modifications; (5) existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; (6) effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements; (7) experience, ability, and depth of lending department management and other relevant staff; (8) quality of loan review and board of directors oversight; (9)The effect of other external factors (i.e. competition, legal and regulatory requirements); (10) the level of estimated credit losses change in the inflationary environment; (11) the level of estimated credit losses change in the interest rate environment. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. In evaluating the level of the allowance, we consider a range of possible 

 32 

Table of Contents 
 assumptions and outcomes related to the various factors identified above. The level of the allowance is particularly sensitive to changes in the actual and forecasted probability of default of benchmarked banks and changes in current conditions or reasonably expected future conditions affecting the collectability of loans. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for credit losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and the PADOB, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for credit losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for credit losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 Total assets . Total assets increased 13.1 million to 452.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 439.7 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in assets was primarily due to increases in net loans receivable and cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease in debt securities available-for-sale. Growth in total assets was funded by the increase in deposits while growth in loans and cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of maturities of short-term treasury securities that were not reinvested in additional securities and instead used to enhance commercial loan growth and our cash position. Cash and cash equivalents increased 22.1 million to 54.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 32.4 million at December 31, 2023. Gross loans increased 22.6 million, or 6.9 , to 349.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 326.6 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to growth in the commercial real estate loan portfolio. Debt securities available-for-sale decreased 31.7 million to 36.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 68.1 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to the maturity of short-term treasury securities. Net loans receivable increased 22.7 million, or 7.1 , to 344.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 321.4 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to the increase in the commercial real estate loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans increased 20.7 million, or 11.2 , to 205.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 184.9 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in commercial real estate loans was primarily due to the continued implementation of our strategy to expand our commercial loan portfolio to enhance revenue. Consumer and other loans increased 4.6 million, or 79.3 , to 10.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 5.8 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to a draw under an existing facility. Commercial and industrial loans increased 2.9 million, or 17.6 , to 19.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 16.6 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to new loan activity. Construction real estate loans decreased 3.1 million, or 28.8 , to 7.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 10.8 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to construction completion and conversion to commercial real estate loans. One- to four-family residential loans decreased 2.6 million, or 2.4 , to 106.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 108.5 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to principal loan payments. Management is monitoring the commercial real estate portfolio and concentration, assessing its associated risks. As part of its risk management process, the Bank segments and stress tests its commercial real estate loan portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 85.5 or 127.6 million of the non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio was subject to stress testing (loans having exposure under 500,000 are not subject to stress testing). At September 30, 2024, the commercial real estate loan portfolio has an average Loan-to-Value ratio of 62.6 and a Debt Service Coverage ratio of 1.64 times, exclusive of any sponsor or guarantor support. The commercial real estate loan portfolio is diverse with respect to both property type as well as location with concentrations limited. Two segments, office space and hospitality, are the subject of market scrutiny with these segments exposure and selected credit metrics are outlined below. The Bank has reviewed its loan portfolio for exposure to office space given the uncertainty and potential risks associated with vacancy, future demand, and repricing risk for these assets. The Bank s exposure to this segment is minimal with only 9.2 million in non-owner-occupied office space at September 30, 2024. Notably the five loans comprising the office segment are all medical related, which the Bank believes has not suffered the same decline that the general office market has experienced. The office space loan portfolio has an average Loan-to-Value ratio of 71.3 and Debt Service Coverage ratio of 1.50 times, exclusive of any sponsor or guarantor support at September 30, 2024.

 The Bank s hospitality portfolio is also an area of market focus. Loan exposure to this segment totaled 25.6 million (seven hotel properties) at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the average Loan-to-Value ratio of the Bank s hospitality portfolio was 73.2 with Debt Service Coverage ratio of 2.74 times, exclusive of any sponsor or guarantor support. The Bank believes guarantor support for the hospitality sector is strong and loans are supported by experienced hotel operators. Cash and cash equivalents increased 22.1 million, or 68.1 , to 54.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 32.4 million at December 31, 2023 due to increases in cash and due from banks and fed funds sold. The increase was due to the maturities and paydowns of 49.5 million of debt securities available-for-sale with 16.2 million that were reinvested and the remainder utilized for liquidity within cash and cash equivalents or to fund loan growth. Debt securities available-for-sale decreased 31.7 million, or 46.6 , to 36.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 68.1 million at December 31, 2023 due to the maturity and paydowns of 49.5 million of securities, primarily short term treasury securities and 378,000 of accretion on the debt securities available for sale, partially offset by purchases of 16.2 million of treasury securities and corporate bonds and a 1.2 million year to date increase in the fair market value of debt securities available for sale. Deposits and borrowings. Total deposits increased 21.8 million, or 6.6 , to 354.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 333.0 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in our deposits reflected a 24.8 million increase in certificates of deposit, a 4.8 million increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits accounts and a 160,000 increase in money market accounts, partially offset by a 7.2 million decrease in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts and a 733,000 decrease in savings accounts, due to customers utilizing their deposits or moving deposits to higher yielding deposit products. D emand deposits increased primarily due to management s continuing focus on increasing the commercial deposit accounts of its customers. T he increase in certificates of deposit was due to offering deposit specials to maintain current certificate of deposit customers and utilization of brokered deposits. Uninsured deposits, excluding public deposits, which are secured with pledged investments and FHLB Letters of Credit, were approximately 38.1 million and 43.7 million, or 11.0 and 14.4 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total borrowings from the FHLB decreased 9.9 million, or 17.9 , to 45.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 55.1 million at December 31, 2023 due to advances that matured during 2024 that were not replaced. Stockholders Equity. Stockholders e quity increased 703,000, or 1.5 , to 47.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 47.0 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was due to net income of 1.1 million and the reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 934,000, partially offset by the repurchase of 130,827 shares of common stock for 1.7 million. Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 General. Net income decreased 109,000, or 21.2 , to 404,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 513,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 109,000 period over period decrease in earnings was attributable to a 1.1 million increase in interest expense and a 119,000 increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by an 872,000 increase in interest and dividend income, a 106,000 decrease in the provision for credit losses , an 89,000 increase in noninterest income and a 30,000 decrease in income tax expense. Interest and dividend income. Total interest and dividend income increased 872,000, or 17.0 , to 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest and dividend income was primarily the result of a 34.6 million increase period over period in the average balance of interest-earning assets, driven by a 23.0 million increase in average loan balances and a 16.6 million increase in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a 4.9 million decrease in average balance of debt and equity securities available for sale and a 47,000 decrease in the average balance of restricted stocks. The increase was also due to a 39 basis points increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The average yield on average interest-earning assets increased to 5.46 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.07 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income on loans, including fees, increased 690,000, or 15.8 , to 5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a 45 basis points increase in 

 34 

Table of Contents 
 the average yield on loans to 5.80 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.35 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in the average balance of loans to 347.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 324.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on loans increased as a result of the higher interest rate environment as new loans were originated at higher rates and the increase in the variable rate loan yields. The increase in the average balance of loans was due primarily to an increase in the average balance of commercial real estate loans reflecting our strategy to grow commercial lending. Interest income on securities and restricted stocks decreased 52,000, or 15.4 , to 285,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 337,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest income on debt and equity securities of 58,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in the average balance of debt and equity securities of 4.9 million, or 12.0 , to 36.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 41.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a 26 basis points decrease in the average yield on debt and equity securities to 2.58 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.84 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases in the average balance and average yields of debt and equity securities was primarily due to the purchase of higher yielding treasury securities during the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the current year period. Restricted stock income is also included in the interest income on securities. Restricted stock income increased 6,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a 117 basis points increase in the average yield on restricted stocks to 8.54 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.37 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of restricted stocks of 47,000, or 1.9 , to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average yield on restricted stock was due to the Federal Home Loan Bank dividend increasing and the average balance in restricted stocks decreased due to decreases in Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings that requires a decrease in our ownership of Federal Home Loan Bank stock. Interest income on cash and cash equivalents increased 234,000, or 55.5 , to 656,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 422,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents was attributable to an increase in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents of 16.6 million, or 47.8 , to 51.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 34.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in the average yield on cash and cash equivalents of 23 basis points to 5.08 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.85 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the higher interest rate environment. Interest expense. Interest expense increased 1.1 million, or 51.8 , to 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 20 from 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of increases in interest expense on deposits and borrowings in the higher interest rate environment. The increase was due to a 76 basis points increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities from 2.66 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.42 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of 58.4 million to 370.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 312.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposits increased 1.1 million, or 66.0 , to 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of an 89 basis points increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits and an increase of 59.6 million in the average balance of our interest-bearing deposits. The increase in the average cost of deposits was primarily due to a 142 basis points increase in the average cost of certificates of deposit, traditionally our higher costing deposits, to 4.58 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.16 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average cost of transaction accounts, traditionally our lower costing deposit accounts, consisting of demand, savings, and money market accounts increased 25 basis points to 2.18 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.93 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in rates was due to the higher interest rate environment and increased competition for deposits. An increase of 39.4 million in the average balance of certificates of deposit to 160.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 121.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to promotional specials to increase deposits in the higher rate environment. An increase in the average balance of our transaction accounts by 20.2 million to 160.0 million for the three months ended

 September 30, 2024 from 139.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to continued strategies to grow deposits through relationship banking. Interest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings increased 1,000, or 0.2 , to 454,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 453,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings resulted from an increase in the average cost of these funds of 16 basis points to 3.66 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.50 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as higher cost Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings were incurred to increase liquidity. There was a decrease of 1.2 million in the average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings to 49.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 50.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of maturing Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings that were not replaced. Net interest income. Net interest income decreased 215,000, or 7.1 , to 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the increases in interest expense on deposits and borrowings and a decrease in interest income on debt securities available-for-sale, partially offset by increases in interest income on loans and cash and cash equivalents. Average net interest-earning assets decreased by 23.7 million to 67.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 91.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin decreased 43 basis points to 2.57 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.00 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest rate spread decreased 37 basis points to 2.04 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.41 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Provision for credit losses. We charge provisions for credit losses to operations in order to maintain our allowance for credit losses on loans and reserve for unfunded commitments at a level that is considered reasonable and necessary to absorb expected credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and expected losses on commitments to grant loans that are expected to be advanced at the consolidated balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, we consider our past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current and forecasted economic conditions, and the levels of non-performing and other classified loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change. We assess the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for credit losses in order to maintain the allowance. Based on our evaluation of the above factors, we recorded a 34,000 provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 140,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in provision for credit losses was primarily due to lower qualitative factor allocations within the Company s current expected credit losses methodology and a lower required allowance for unfunded commitments. The allowance for credit losses on loans was 4.4 million, or 1.27 , of loans outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 4.5 million, or 1.38 , of loans outstanding at December 31, 2023. To the best of our knowledge, we have recorded our best estimate of expected losses in the loan portfolio and for unfunded commitments at September 30, 2024. However, future changes in the factors described above, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to our loan portfolio, could result in material increases in our provision for credit losses. In addition, the PADOB and the FDIC, as an integral part of their examination process, will periodically review our allowance for credit losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for credit losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.

The increase in noninterest income resulted primarily from the increases in gain (loss) on equity securities of 53,000 and an increase in other income of 25,000. The gain (loss) on equity securities increased 53,000 due to 29,000 of gain in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 24,000 of loss in the third quarter of 2023. Other income increased 25,000 primarily due to loan related fee income of 57,000 and 22,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, earned for brokering interest rate swap agreements between the Bank s customers and counterparties unrelated to the Bank. Noninterest Expenses . Noninterest expenses information is as follows.

The increase in noninterest expenses was primarily the result of increases in salaries and employee benefits of 79,000 and an increase in data and item processing of 67,000. Salaries and employee benefits increased 79,000 primarily due to the hiring of additional full-time equivalent employees and annual salary increases. Data and item processing increased 67,000 as the Company continues to invest in our information technology infrastructure. Income tax expense . Income tax expense decreased 30,000, or 21.3 , to 111,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 141,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rates were 21.6 for both the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The decrease in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes and relatively consistent levels of income not subject to taxes. Average balances and yields . The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects would be immaterial. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans were included in the computation of average

 Rate/Volume Analysis The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total increase (decrease) column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period items or adjustments required to be excluded from the table below.

Net income decreased 419,000, or 27.7 , to 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 419,000 period over period decrease in earnings was attributable to a 4.1 million increase in interest expense and a 146,000 increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a 3.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, a 603,000 decrease in the provision for credit losses , a 119,000 decrease in income tax expense and a 69,000 increase in noninterest income . Interest and dividend income. Total interest and dividend income increased 3.0 million, or 20.6 , to 17.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest and dividend income was primarily the result of a 45.3 million increase period over period in the average balance of interest-earning assets, driven by a 25.5 million increase in average loan balances, a 19.1 million increase in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents, a 550,000 increase in average balance of debt and equity securities available for sale and a 99,000 increase in the average balance of restricted stocks. The increase was also the result of a 39 basis points increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The average yield on average interest-earning assets increased to 5.36 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.97 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income on loans, including fees, increased 1.9 million, or 15.5 , to 14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 12.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting an increase in the average balance of loans to 341.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 315.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and a 37 basis points increase in the average yield on loans to 5.67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.30 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average balance of loans was due primarily to an increase in the average balance of commercial real estate loans reflecting our strategy to grow commercial lending. The average yield on loans increased as a result of the higher interest rate environment as new loans were originated at higher rates and the increase in the variable rate loan yields.

 Interest income on securities and restricted stocks increased 125,000, or 16.9 , to 863,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 738,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income on debt and equity securities of 97,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a 32 basis points increase in the average yield on debt and equity securities to 2.54 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.22 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in the average balance of debt and equity securities of 550,000, or 1.5 , to 37.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 36.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in the average yield and the average balance of debt and equity securities was primarily due to the purchase of higher yielding short term agency bonds, corporate bonds and treasury securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. Restricted stock income is also included in the interest income on securities. Restricted stock income increased 28,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a 123 basis points increase in the average yield on restricted stocks to 8.50 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.27 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and due to an increase in the average balance of restricted stocks of 99,000, or 4.2 , to 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in average yield on restricted stock was due to the Federal Home Loan Bank dividend increasing and the average balance in restricted stocks increased due to increases in average Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings that requires an increase in our ownership of Federal Home Loan Bank stock. Interest income on cash and cash equivalents increased 932,000, or 72.6 , to 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents was attributable to an increase in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents of 19.1 million, or 50.8 , to 56.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 37.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in the average yield on cash and cash equivalents of 67 basis points to 5.22 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the higher interest rate environment. Interest expense. Interest expense increased 4.1 million, or 77.5 , to 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 20 from 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of increases in interest expense on deposits and borrowings in the higher interest rate environment. The increase was due to a 109 basis points increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities from 2.25 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of 60.8 million to 372.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 311.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposits increased 3.9 million, or 99.4 , to 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of a 127 basis points increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits and an increase of 59.6 million in the average balance of our interest-bearing deposits. The increase in the average cost of deposits was primarily due to a 169 basis points increase in the average cost of certificates of deposit, traditionally our higher costing deposits, to 4.44 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.75 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average cost of transaction accounts, traditionally our lower costing deposit accounts, consisting of demand, savings, and money market accounts increased 73 basis points to 2.17 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.44 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in rates was due to the higher interest rate environment and an increased competition for deposits. An increase of 40.9 million in the average balance of certificates of deposit to 158.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 117.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to promotional specials to increase deposits in the higher rate environment. An increase in the average balance of our transaction accounts by 18.6 million to 162.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 144.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to continued strategies to grow deposits through relationship banking. Interest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings increased 129,000, or 10.0 , to 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings resulted from an increase in the average cost of these funds of 29 basis points to 3.70 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.41 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as higher cost Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings were incurred to increase liquidity. There was an increase of 1.3 million in the

Table of Contents 
 average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings to 51.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 49.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of using Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings to fund loan growth and increase liquidity. Net interest income. Net interest income decreased 1.1 million, or 11.4 , to 8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the increases in interest expense on deposits and borrowings, partially offset by increases in interest income on loans, cash and cash equivalents and debt securities available-for-sale. Average net interest-earning assets decreased by 15.6 million to 65.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 80.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin decreased 66 basis points to 2.52 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.18 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest rate spread decreased 70 basis points to 2.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.72 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Provision for credit losses. We charge provisions for credit losses to operations in order to maintain our allowance for credit losses on loans and reserve for unfunded commitments at a level that is considered reasonable and necessary to absorb expected credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and expected losses on commitments to grant loans that are expected to be advanced at the consolidated balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, we consider our past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current and forecasted economic conditions, and the levels of non-performing and other classified loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change. We assess the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for credit losses in order to maintain the allowance. Based on our evaluation of the above factors, we recorded a 33,000 reversal of the provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 570,000 provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The reversal of provision for credit losses was primarily due to lower qualitative factor allocations within the Company s current expected credit losses methodology and a lower required allowance for unfunded commitments. The allowance for credit losses on loans was 4.4 million, or 1.27 , of loans outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 4.5 million, or 1.38 , of loans outstanding at December 31, 2023. To the best of our knowledge, we have recorded our best estimate of expected losses in the loan portfolio and for unfunded commitments at September 30, 2024. However, future changes in the factors described above, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to our loan portfolio, could result in material increases in our provision for credit losses. In addition, the PADOB and the FDIC, as an integral part of their examination process, will periodically review our allowance for credit losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the allowance for credit losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.

 Noninterest income increased by 69,000, or 11.9 , to 651,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 582,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest income resulted primarily from the increase in gain (loss) on equity securities of 41,000 and by no loss on disposal of premises and equipment for the 2024 period compared to a loss of 40,000 for the 2023 period from replacing the non-depository ATMs with full functioning ATMs, partially offset by a decrease in other service charges of 29,000. The gain (loss) on equity securities increased 41,000 due to 17,000 of gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24,000 of loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other service charges decreased 29,000 primarily due to 31,000 of late fee recoveries on two non-accrual loans that paid off in the second quarter of 2023. Noninterest Expenses . Noninterest expenses information is as follows.

Noninterest expenses increased 146,000, or 2.0 , to 7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 7.4 million for the same prior year period. The increase in noninterest expenses was primarily the result of an increase in data and item processing expense of 117,000 and an increase in salaries and employee benefits of 70,000, partially offset by a decrease in other expenses of 63,000. Data and item processing expense increased 117,000 as the Company continues to invest in our information technology infrastructure. Salaries and employee benefits increased 70,000 primarily due to the hiring of additional full-time equivalent employees and annual salary increases. Other expenses decreased by 63,000 primarily as the result of a decrease in dues and subscriptions expenses. Income tax expense . Income tax expense decreased 119,000, or 28.3 , to 301,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 420,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rates were 21.6 and 21.8 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes and relatively consistent levels of income not subject to taxes.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 Increase (Decrease) Due to Total Increase Volume Rate (Decrease) (In thousands) Interest-earning assets: Loans 1,011 933 1,944 Debt and equity securities 9 88 97 Restricted stocks 5 23 28 Cash and cash equivalents 651 281 932 Total interest-earning assets 1,676 1,325 3,001 Interest-bearing liabilities: Interest-bearing demand deposits 233 476 709 Savings deposits (19) (21) (40) Money market deposits 33 389 422 Certificates of deposit 843 2,002 2,845 Total deposits 1,090 2,846 3,936 Borrowings 33 96 129 Total interest-bearing liabilities 1,123 2,942 4,065 Change in net interest income 553 (1,617) (1,064) Non-Performing Assets and Allowance for Credit Losses Non-performing loans. Non-performing loans are reviewed on a weekly basis by management and again by our credit committee on a monthly basis. Nonaccrual loans are loans for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. When loans are placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received on a cash basis or cost recovery method. Real estate owned . When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as real estate owned. The real estate owned is recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Soon after acquisition, we order a new appraisal to determine the current market value of the property. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan satisfied over the market value of the property is charged against the allowance for credit losses. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. We had no real estate owned at September 30, 2024 or as of December 31, 2023.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, two commercial real estate loans for 655,000 at December 31, 2023 returned to accrual status and one commercial real estate loan for 499,000 at September 30, 2024 was placed on non-accrual status. In addition, payments on nonaccrual loans resulted in the decrease in overall nonaccrual loans.

 Allowance for credit losses on loans . The following table sets forth activity in our allowance for credit losses on loans for the periods indicated. 

At or For the Three Months Ended September 30, At or For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) (Dollars in thousands) Allowance for credit losses at beginning of year 4,500 4,314 4,511 3,992 Provision for credit losses - on loans 39 153 25 602 Charge-offs: Real estate: One- to four-family residential Commercial (115) (115) Construction Commercial and industrial (144) Consumer and other (6) Total charge-offs (115) (121) (144) Recoveries: Real estate: One- to four-family residential 15 Commercial Construction Commercial and industrial 2 1 5 3 Consumer and other 4 10 Total recoveries 6 1 15 18 Net recoveries (charge-offs) (109) 1 (106) (126) Allowance for credit losses at end of period 4,430 4,468 4,430 4,468 Allowance to nonaccrual loans 348.82 548.89 348.82 548.89 Allowance to total loans outstanding at the end of the period 1.27 1.35 1.27 1.35 Net charge-offs to average loans outstanding during the period (annualized) 0.12 0.04 0.05 The provision for credit losses decreased 106,000, or 75.7 , to 34,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from a provision of 140,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses decreased 603,000, or 105.8 , to 33,000) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from a provision of 570,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses for both periods was primarily due to lower qualitative factor allocations within the Company s current expected credit losses methodology and a lower required allowance for unfunded commitments. Charge-offs of 115,000 and 121,000 was taken in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to -0- and 144,000 for the same periods in 2023, respectively. Delinquencies remain benign, reserve levels are deemed to be adequate and the allowance

 coverage ratio has remained strong at September 30, 2024. The allowance to total loans outstanding was 1.27 at September 30, 2024, decreasing from 1.38 at December 31, 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity management . Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from sales, maturities and calls of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. At September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow approximately 199.5 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, of which 45.2 million had been advanced in addition to 9.0 million held in reserve to secure three letters of credit to collateralize municipal deposits. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow 7.5 million from the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank, 5.0 million from SouthState Bank, N.A. and we also maintained a line of credit of 2.0 million with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. We did not borrow against the credit line with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank, SouthState Bank, N.A., or the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 except to do our annual testing on the lines. The board of directors is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We seek to maintain a liquidity ratio of 5.0 or greater. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our liquidity ratio averaged 15.7 and 13.1 , respectively. We believe that we had enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long-term liquidity needs as of September 30, 2024. We monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand; (2) expected deposit flows; (3) yields available on cash and cash equivalents and securities; and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in cash and cash equivalents and short-and intermediate-term securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which include federal funds sold. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 54.5 million. Unpledged debt securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled 12.2 million at September 30, 2024. We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2024, totaled 147.0 million, or 86.3 of our certificates of deposit, and 41.4 of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or borrowings than we currently pay. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. Capital management. At September 30, 2024, Presence Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding our capital resources. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Commitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. At September 

 47 

Table of Contents 
 30, 2024, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of 26.8 million, unused lines of credit totaling 12.6 million and 8.3 million in stand-by letters of credit outstanding. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current lending commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2024 totaled 147.0 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new deposits, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. Contractual obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services . Higher inflation and its impacts, nationally or in the markets that the Company serves could adversely affect, among other things, real estate valuations, unemployment levels, the ability of businesses to remain viable, and consumer and business confidence, which could lead to decreases in demand for loans and deposits and increases in loan delinquencies and defaults. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk A smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information related to this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act )) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations are operating in an effective manner. Internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
