 Three

 (Unaudited) 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. In accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 205-40, Going
Concern , the Company s management has evaluated whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the accompanying financial statements were issued. The Company
and CardCash have a history of reporting net losses and negative operating cash flows. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. In addition,
our independent registered public accounting firm, in its audit report to the financial statements included in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund
its business activities and to ultimately achieve sustainable operating revenues and profitability. The Company has financed its working
capital requirements through borrowings from various sources and the sale of its equity securities. 

As
market conditions present uncertainty as to the Company s ability to secure additional funds, there can be no assurances that the
Company will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, as and when necessary to continue to conduct operations. There
is also significant uncertainty as to the effect that the coronavirus may have on the Company s business plans and the amount and
type of financing available to the Company in the future. If the Company is unable to obtain the cash resources necessary to satisfy
the Company s ongoing cash requirements, the Company could be required to scale back its business activities or to discontinue
its operations entirely. 

Amounts
billed and due from the Company s customers are classified as accounts receivable on the balance sheet. Amounts received in advance
from customers are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the performance obligations have been satisfied. The Company
has elected to apply the practical expedient to not assess contracts for significant financing component because the period between the
receipt of advance payment and the Company s transfer of services to the customer is less than one year. 

Other 

Sale
of promotional gift cards, sale of travel, vacation and merchandise, and advertising revenues 

The
Company also recognizes revenue from the sale of Restaurant.com promotional gift cards (revenue recognized based on the Company s
historical redemption rates of its promotional gift cards), the sale of travel, vacation, and merchandise on behalf of third-party merchants
(revenue reported on a net basis equal to the purchase price received from the customer less a portion of the purchase price paid by
the Company to its merchant partners), and advertising revenue for third-party partners, such as Google Ads, wherein third-party website(s)
and/or product(s) are shown or incorporated in the Company s platform or website (revenue recognized when its determinable, which
is generally upon receipt of a statement and/or proceeds from the third-party partners).

The
Company reviews all finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable.
If the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the excess carrying value over
the fair value in our consolidated statements of operations. 

. Under
ASC 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other , goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead
are tested for impairment annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The Company s impairment
testing is performed annually at December 31. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is determined by comparing
the fair value of the Company s reporting unit to the carrying value of the underlying net assets in the reporting unit. If the
fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value of its net assets, goodwill is deemed impaired and
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the fair value of the
reporting unit and the fair value of its other assets and liabilities. In accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of
the ASC, the Company s chief operating decision maker (the Company s Chief Executive Officer) determined that there is only
one reporting unit. No impairment indicators were identified as of September 30, 2024. 

impairment indicators were identified
as of September 30, 2024. 

and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively, which are recorded in general and administrative in the Statements of Operations. 

The
Company values its equity awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and accounts for forfeitures when they occur. Use of the
Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, and a
risk-free interest rate. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock, calculated
utilizing a look-back period approximately equal to the contractual life of the stock option being granted. The expected life of the
stock option is calculated as the mid-point between the vesting period and the contractual term (the simplified method ).
The risk-free interest rate is estimated using comparable published federal funds rates.

The
issuable and potentially issuable shares as summarized above. These potentially issuable common shares would have been anti-dilutive
because the Company had a net loss for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, such common stock equivalents would have been excluded
from the calculation of net loss per share. 

A
financial asset or liability classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment
and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. 

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments (consisting of cash, accounts receivables, deposits to credit card processors,
prepaid expense and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, notes payable, and other liabilities) are considered to
be representative of their respective fair values due to the short-term nature of those instruments.

note payable for , and payment of in cash. 

The
Company utilized the acquisition method of accounting for the acquisition in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations , and
allocated the purchase price to CardCash s tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities at their estimated
fair values as of the date of acquisition. The fair value assigned to the developed technology was determined using the relief from royalty
method. The fair value assigned to trade name were determined using the relief from royalty method. The fair value of the customer relationships
was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, which estimates the direct cash flow expected to be generated from the
existing customers acquired. The cash flows were based on estimates used to value the acquisition, and the discount rates applied were
benchmarked with reference to the implied rate of return from the transaction model, as well as the weighted average cost of capital.
The valuation assumptions took into consideration the Company s estimates of customer attrition and revenue growth projections.
The excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the estimated fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets has been
recorded as goodwill. Goodwill also represents the future benefits as a result of the acquisition that the Company believes will enhance
the Company s product offerings and lineup available to both new and existing customers and generate future synergies within the
discount coupon and gift card business. 

As
of September 30, 2024, management has not yet finalized its valuation analysis. In accordance with ASC 805, the Company made an initial
provisional allocation of the purchase price for CardCash based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The
fair values of the assets acquired, as set forth below, are considered provisional and subject to adjustment as additional information
is obtained through the purchase price measurement period (a period of up to one year from the closing date). Any prospective adjustments
through the purchase price measurement period would change the fair value allocation as of the acquisition date. The Company is still
in the process of reviewing underlying models, assumptions and discount rates used in the valuation of provisional goodwill and intangible
assets.

With
advanced fraud prevention technology, known as FraudFix, CardCash ensures the security and integrity of all transactions conducted on

Restaurant.com

Restaurant.com
is a pioneer in the restaurant deal space and the nation s largest restaurant-focused digital deals brand. We derive our revenue
from transactions in which we sell discount certificates for restaurants on behalf of third-party restaurants. Founded in 1999, we connect
digital consumers, businesses, and communities offering dining and merchant deal options nationwide at over 182,500 restaurants and retailers
to over 7.8 million customers. Our 10,000 core restaurants and 170,000 Dining Discount Pass restaurants and retailers extend nationwide.
Our top three B2C markets are New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. 

Restaurant.com
Business to Customer Division 

Our
B2C division accounted for 45 of gross revenue in our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. To our database of 6.2 million customers,
we sell: 

Discounted certificates for 10,000 restaurants. The certificates range from 5 to 100 and never expire. 

Discount Dining Passes, which provide discounts at 170,000 restaurants and other retailers. These passes provide multiple uses for nine
months. 

Specials by Restaurant.com which bundle Restaurant.com certificates with a variety of other entertainment options, including
theatre, movies, wine and travel. Customers have favored these bundled offering Specials ), generating significantly greater
revenue per customer when compared to purchasing our other products. The average other Company value for these Specials sales is nearly
five times a certificate purchase. Specials generated over 5 of our past year s B2C revenue from 60 of the B2C revenue of the
Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. We believe that our relationships with small businesses presents a significant revenue
opportunity through such cross-promotions. 

Restaurant.com

Our
B2B division accounted for 55 of our gross revenue in our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. We sell certificates and Discount Dining
Passes to corporations and marketers, which use them to:

Restaurant.com
Other Business 

We
also generate revenue through third-party offers and display ad revenue. This comprises a de minimis portion of our gross revenue.

Restaurant.com
Attractive Customer Demographics 

We
intend to grow and leverage our customer database of 6.2 million which we believe is of value to merchants for a variety of services
and products. 

Inflation 

Global
inflation also increased during 2021 and in 2022. The Russia and Ukraine conflict and other geopolitical conflicts, as well as related
international response, have exacerbated inflationary pressures, including causing increases in the price for goods and services and
global supply chain disruptions, which have resulted and may continue to result in shortages in food products, materials and services.
Such shortages have resulted and may continue to result in inflationary cost increases for labor, fuel, food products, materials and
services, and could continue to cause costs to increase as well as result in the scarcity of certain materials. We cannot predict any
future trends in the rate of inflation or other negative economic factors or associated increases in our operating costs and how that
may impact our business. To the extent we and the restaurant customers we service are unable to recover higher operating costs resulting
from inflation or otherwise mitigate the impact of such costs on our and their business, our revenues and gross profit could decrease,
and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company has a history of reporting net losses and negative operating cash flows. At September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of 3,090,980
available to fund its operations, including expansion plans, and to service its debt, and a working capital deficit of 2,182,182. 

Our
consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have experienced operating losses and negative operating
cash flows during 2023 and 2022. We have financed our working capital requirements through borrowings from various sources and the sale
of our equity securities. 

As
a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s
independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2023, has also expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund
its business activities and to ultimately achieve sustainable operating revenues and profitability. 

As
market conditions present uncertainty as to the Company s ability to secure additional funds, there can be no assurances that the
Company will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, as and when necessary to continue to conduct operations. There
is also significant uncertainty as to the effect that the coronavirus may have on the Company s business plans and the amount and
type of financing available to the Company in the future. 

If
the Company is unable to obtain the cash resources necessary to satisfy the Company s ongoing cash requirements, the Company could
be required to scale back its business activities or to discontinue its operations entirely.

We
present Modified EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on
a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Modified
EBITDA for developing our internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in
evaluating potential acquisitions; making compensation decisions; and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial
performance. Modified EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following: 

Modified EBITDA does not
 reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

Modified EBITDA does not
 reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Modified EBITDA does not
 reflect future interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; and 

Although depreciation and
 amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Modified
 EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

Company adds personnel and incurs additional costs related to its operation as a public company, including higher legal, accounting,
insurance, compliance, compensation and other costs.

Modified

In
addition to our GAAP results, we present Modified EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. However, Modified EBITDA is not
a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations or any other
performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company s consolidated financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 presented elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). Certain accounting policies and estimates
are particularly important to the understanding of the Company s financial position and results of operations and require the application
of significant judgment by management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions
that are outside of the Company s control. As a result, these issues are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying
these policies, management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates.
Those estimates are based on the Company s historical operations, the future business plans and the projected financial results,
the terms of existing contracts, trends in the industry, and information available from other outside sources. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . 

The
Company buys merchant gift cards from the general public and distributors at a discount and then resells them at a markup. The Company
also derives revenue from the sale of discount certificates for restaurants on behalf of third-party restaurants. 

Revenue
and costs of sales are recognized when control of the products transfers to our customer, which generally occurs at a point in time when
the risk and title to the product transfers to the customer upon delivery to the customer. The Company s performance obligations
are satisfied at that time. The Company s standard terms of delivery are included in its contracts of sale, the confirmation documents,
and invoices. The Company recognizes revenue on a gross basis for the sales price of the merchant gift cards and discount certificates
it collects. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company periodically issues share-based awards to employees and non-employees and consultants for services rendered. Stock options vest
and expire according to terms established at the issuance date of each grant. Stock grants are measured at the grant date fair value.
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at fair value on the grant date and is generally recognized as a charge to operations ratably
over the requisite service, or vesting, period. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period and manner
as if the Company had paid cash for the services. 

10 

Acquisitions
and Business Combinations 

The
Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and separately identified
intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair
values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates
and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but
are not limited to, future expected cash flows from, acquired technology, trademarks and trade names, useful lives, and discount rates.
Management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and
unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which can be up to one year
from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding
offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements
of operations. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

See
discussion of recent accounting pronouncements in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty concerning
our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our
consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We experienced operating losses and negative operating cash
flows during 2023 and 2022. We have financed our working capital requirements through borrowings from various sources and the sale of
equity securities. 

We
have a history of reporting net losses. At September 30, 2024, we had cash of 3,090,980 available to fund our operations, including
expansion plans, and to service our debt, and a working capital deficit of 2,182,182. We anticipate our cash balance will last until
at least June 2025. As a result, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

On October 25, 2024, we entered into an At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement
with Ascendiant Capital Markets, LLC, as sales agent to sell shares of our common stock, par value 0.001 (the Common Stock ),
having an aggregate offering price of up to 30,000,000 (the Shares from time to time, through an at the market
offering (the ATM Offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
Act ). As of the date of the filing this report, the Company sold 37,102 shares of Common Stock and received proceeds of
 66,341, or an average of 1.79 per share. 

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund its business
activities and to ultimately achieve sustainable operating revenues and profitability. 

As
market conditions present uncertainty as to our ability to secure additional funds, there can be no assurances that we will be able to
secure additional financing on acceptable terms, as and when necessary, to continue to conduct operations. There is also significant
uncertainty as to the amount and type of financing available to us in the future. 

If
we are unable to obtain the cash resources necessary to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements, we could be required to scale back its
business activities or to discontinue its operations entirely. 

Our
consolidated statements of cash flows as discussed herein are presented below.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure control and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
Rules 13a-15(f). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, management s assessment
identified the following material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting: 

We
continue to have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in the December 31, 2023, Annual Report
on Form 10-K, in that we had inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Specifically, certain personnel have
the ability to both (i) create and post journal entries within our general ledger system and (ii) prepare and review account reconciliations;
and (ii) we did not design and maintain effective controls over certain information technology IT general controls for
information systems that are relevant to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and
maintain effective program change management controls to ensure that information technology program and data changes affecting certain
financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately. 

Notwithstanding
the identified material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
present fairly, in all material respects, the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
disclosed in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 

Remediation
Plan 

Management
has been actively engaged in developing and implementing remediation plans to address material weaknesses described above. These remediation
efforts are ongoing and include or are expected to include designing and implementing controls to formalize roles and review responsibilities
to align with our team s skills and experience and designing and implementing controls over segregation of duties, and designing
and implementing IT general controls, including controls over the review and update of user access rights and privileges and program
change management controls. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. 

14 

These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a
simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
