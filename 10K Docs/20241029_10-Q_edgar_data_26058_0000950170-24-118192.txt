Intangible assets acquired have been assigned a provisional value of with an estimated weighted average amortization period of years.

On December 15, 2021, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with a group of banks (the Revolving Credit Facility to (i) increase the total credit facility to , which may be increased by at the request of the Company, subject to the administrative agent's approval, (ii) extend the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility from to , (iii) replace LIBOR with SOFR as the primary reference rate used to calculate interest on the loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, (iv) increase available sublimits for letters of credit and swing line loans as well as providing for additional alternative currency borrowing capabilities, and (v) modify the financial and non-financial covenants to provide the Company additional flexibility. This unsecured credit facility replaced the prior unsecured credit facility, which would have expired February 12, 2024. Borrowings in U.S. dollars under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at a per annum rate equal to the applicable Term SOFR rate (but not less than ), plus the Term SOFR adjustment, and plus an applicable margin, which ranges from to , based on our net leverage ratio. Similarly, borrowings of alternative currencies under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest equal to a defined risk-free reference rate, plus the applicable risk-free rate adjustment and plus an applicable margin, which ranges from to , based on our net leverage ratio. We use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our revolving credit facility s outstanding balance from a variable rate of interest to a fixed rate. The contractual rate of these arrangements ranges from to . Refer to Note 13, Derivative Financial Instruments, for further discussion on the impact of interest rate swaps. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a swing line sublimit of and a letter of credit sublimit of . We also pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee ranges from to based on our net leverage ratio. The Revolving Credit Facility requires, in addition to customary representations and warranties, that we comply with a maximum net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Failure to comply with these covenants could reduce the borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 30, 2024. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that we deliver quarterly financial statements, annual financial statements, auditor certifications, and compliance certificates within a specified number of days after the end of a quarter and year. Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictions limiting our ability to: dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay other debt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens on assets; make investments, loans or advances; make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates; and make stock repurchases and dividend payments.

 recognition of ineffectiveness was recorded in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Foreign Currency Hedges We use forward contracts to mitigate currency risk related to a portion of our forecasted foreign currency revenues and costs. The currency forward contracts are designed as cash flow hedges and are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We continue to monitor the Company s overall currency exposure and may elect to add cash flow hedges in the future. At September 30, 2024 , we had a net unrealized loss of in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings within the next 12 months. The notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was at September 30, 2024. Interest Rate Swaps We use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our Revolving Credit Facility s outstanding balance from a variable rate of interest to a fixed rate. As of September 30, 2024 , we have agreements to fix interest rates on of long-term debt un til December 2026. The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the swap agreements will be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense when settled. These swaps are treated as cash flow hedges and consequently, the changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. The estimated net amount of the existing gains that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is approximately . Cross-Currency Swap The Company has operations and investments in various international locations and is subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates. In order to hedge the Krone-based purchase price for the acquisition of Ferroperm Piezoceramics, A.S. Ferroperm ),

of variable rate debt to Krone denominated variable rate debt. Upon completion of the Ferroperm acquisition on June 30, 2022, the transaction was designated as a net investment hedge for accounting purposes and will mature on . Accordingly, any gains or losses on this derivative instrument are included in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income (loss) until the net investment is sold, diluted or liquidated. At September 30, 2024, we had a net unrealized loss of in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Interest payments received for the cross-currency swap are excluded from the net investment hedge effectiveness assessment and are recorded in interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The assumptions used in measuring fair value of the cross-currency swap are considered level 2 inputs, which are based upon the Krone to U.S. Dollar exchange rate market.

We use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our Revolving Credit Facility s outstanding balance from a variable rate of interest into a fixed rate and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the effect of foreign currency changes on certain revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies. The Company entered into a cross-currency swap agreement in order to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates related to foreign debt. These derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of our interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges were measured using standard valuation models using market-based observable inputs over the contractual terms, including forward yield curves, among others. There is a readily determinable market for these derivative instruments, but that market is not active and therefore they are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the contingent consideration requires significant judgment. The Company's fair value estimates used in the contingent consideration valuation are considered Level 3 fair value measurements. The fair value estimates were based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain, including estimates of future revenues and timing of events and activities that are expected to take place. Refer to Note 3 Business Acquisitions for further discussion on contingent consideration.

Our effective income tax rate was and for the three months ended of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to a change in mix of earnings taxed at lower rates and tax benefits from the filing of the US federal income tax return. The third quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory federal tax rate for the same reason as noted above. The third quarter 2023 effective income tax rate was higher than the U.S. statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the mix of foreign earnings that are taxed at higher rates. Our effective income tax rate was and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to a mix of earnings taxed at lower rates and tax benefits from the filing of the U.S. federal income tax return. The effective income tax rate in the first nine months of 2024 was lower than the U.S. statutory federal tax rate for the same reason as noted above. The effective income tax rate in the first nine months of 2023 was higher than the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate primarily due the mix of foreign earnings that are taxed at higher rates partially offset by tax benefits recorded upon vesting of restricted stock and tax benefits from amended U.S. federal income tax returns.

Net sales were 132,424 in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 2,128 or 1.6 from the third quarter of 2023. Net sales to the transportation market decreased 12,959 or 17.1 while net sales to other diversified end-markets increased 10,831 or 18.5 . The overall decline in net sales was primarily driven by decreased volumes from our commercial vehicle related products and lower sales to transportation customers in China. Partially offsetting the sales decline were sales from our acquisition of SyQwest of 3,615, as well as changes in foreign exchange rates. Net sales increased 508 year-over-year related to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily due to the U.S. Dollar depreciating compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro. 
 Gross margin was 49,788 in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 3,387 or 7.3 from the third quarter of 2023. Our gross margin percentage increased from 34.5 for the third quarter of 2023 to 37.6 for the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to improved end-market mix, operational improvements, and the impact of certain cost saving actions previously taken as discussed in Note 9 Costs Associated with Exit and Restructuring Activities in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additionally, changes in foreign exchange rates had a net benefit on our gross margin of approximately 1,464 primarily due to rate changes between the U.S. Dollar and the Mexican Peso. 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses were 22,509 or 17.0 of net sales in the third quarter of 2024 versus 18,666 or 13.9 of net sales in the third quarter of 2023. This increase is primarily related to the reduction of incentive and equity-based compensation expense that occurred in the third quarter of 2023. Research and development R D expenses were 5,031 or 3.8 of net sales in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 6,321 or 4.7 of net sales in the comparable quarter of 2023. This decrease is primarily related to the timing of non-recurring engineering expense reimbursement during the quarter. 
 Restructuring charges were 773 or 0.7 of net sales in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3,226 or 2.4 of net sales in the third quarter of 2023. The restructuring charges in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were primarily related to actions undertaken to better align our cost structure with lower end-market demand. See Note 9 Costs Associated with Exit and Restructuring Activities in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.

Net sales were 388,336 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 37,392 or 8.8 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net sales to the transportation market decreased 38,530 or 16.6 while net sales to other diversified end-markets increased 1,138 or 0.5 . The decline in overall net sales was primarily driven by lower volumes of commercial vehicle related products, lower sales to transportation customers in China and decreased sales in the industrial end market. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 674 due to the U.S. Dollar appreciating compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro.

Gross margin was 141,250 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 7,545 or 5.1 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year over year decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by lower sales volumes. 
 Our gross margin percentage was 36.4 for the first nine months of 2024, an increase from 35.0 in the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to improved end-market mix, operational improvements, and the impact of certain cost saving actions previously taken as discussed in Note 9 Costs Associated with Exit and Restructuring Activities in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additionally, changes in foreign exchange rates had a net benefit on our gross margin of approximately 627. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 SG A expenses were 66,100 or 17.0 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 64,339 or 15.1 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. R D expenses were 17,718 or 4.6 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19,628 or 4.6 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Restructuring charges were 3,657 or 0.9 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6,033 or 1.4 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The restructuring charges were primarily related to actions undertaken to better align our cost structure with lower end-market demand. See Note 9 Costs Associated with Exit and Restructuring Activities in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 Other income and expense items are summarized in the following table:

Effective tax rate

21.4 

Our effective income tax rate was 17.4 and 21.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to a mix of earnings taxed at lower rates and tax benefits from the filing of the US federal income tax return. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have historically funded our capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities, supported by available credit under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). We believe that cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investments, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. However, we may choose to pursue additional equity and debt financing to provide additional liquidity or to fund acquisitions. 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 94,875 at September 30, 2024, and 163,876 at December 31, 2023, of which 86,181 and 99,940, respectively, were held outside the United States. Total long-term debt was 102,700 as of September 30, 2024 and 67,500 as of December 31, 2023.

330,860 

On December 15, 2021, we entered into a second amended and restated five-year credit agreement with a group of banks (the Revolving Credit Facility to (i) increase the total credit facility availability to 400,000, which may be increased by 200,000 at the request of the Company, subject to the administrative agent's approval, (ii) extend the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility from February 12, 2024 to December 15, 2026, (iii) replace LIBOR with SOFR as the primary reference rate used to calculate interest on the loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, (iv) increase available sublimits for letters of credit, and swing line loans as well as providing for additional alternative currency borrowing capabilities, and (v) modify the financial and non-financial covenants to provide the Company additional flexibility. This new unsecured credit facility replaced the prior 300,000 unsecured credit facility, which would have expired February 12, 2024. 
 32 

Borrowings in U.S. Dollars under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at a per annum rate equal to the applicable Term SOFR rate (but not less than 0.0 ), plus the Term SOFR adjustment, and plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.00 to 1.75 , based on our net leverage ratio. Similarly, borrowings of alternative currencies under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest equal to a defined risk-free reference rate, plus the applicable risk-free rate adjustment and plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.00 to 1.75 , based on our net leverage ratio. We use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our revolving credit facility's outstanding balance from a variable rate of interest to a fixed rate. The contractual rate of these arrangements ranges from 1.49 to 2.49 . 
 The Revolving Credit Facility includes a swing-line sublimit of 20,000 and a letter of credit sublimit of 20,000. We also pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee ranges from 0.175 to 0.25 based on our net leverage ratio. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 30, 2024. 
 Acquisition 
 On July 29, 2024, we acquired 100 of the outstanding membership interests of SyQwest a leading designer and manufacturer of a broad set of sonar and acoustic sensing solutions primarily for naval applications, for 121.9 million, net of cash and up to 15 million in future contingent consideration. The SyQwest acquisition will strengthen our strategy and scale in the defense end market. The acquisition was funded from both cash on hand and borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures. The assumptions, estimates, and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends, and other factors the Company believes are relevant at the time it prepares the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The critical accounting policies and estimates are consistent with those discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the MD A section of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. During and as of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in the application of critical accounting policies or estimates.

Such statements are made in reliance on the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included or incorporated in this document, including statements regarding our strategy, financial position, guidance, funding for continued operations, cash reserves, liquidity, projected costs, plans, projects, awards and contracts, and objectives of management, among others, are forward-looking statements. Words such as expect, anticipate,

should, believe, hope, target, continued, project, plan, goals, opportunity, appeal, estimate, potential, predict, demonstrates, may, will, might, could, intend, shall, possible, would, approximately, likely, outlook, schedule, on track, poised, pipeline, and variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements , but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, conditions or results. Forward-looking statements are based on management s expectations, certain assumptions, and currently available information. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof and are based on various assumptions as to future events, the occurrence of which necessarily are subject to uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are made subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which could cause CTS actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those presented in the forward-looking statements. Examples of factors that may affect future operating results and financial condition include, but are not limited to: supply chain disruptions; changes in the economy generally, including inflationary and/or recessionary conditions, and in respect to the business in which CTS operates; unanticipated issues in integrating acquisitions including, without limitation the integration of SyQwest; the results of actions to reposition CTS business; rapid technological change; general market conditions in the transportation, as well as conditions in the industrial, aerospace and defense, and medical markets; reliance on key customers; unanticipated public health crises, natural disasters or other events; environmental compliance and remediation expenses; the ability to protect CTS intellectual property; pricing pressures and demand for CTS products; risks associated with CTS international operations, including trade and tariff barriers, exchange rates and political and geopolitical risks (including, without limitation, the potential impact U.S./China relations and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition); the amount and timing of any share repurchases; and the effect of any cybersecurity incidents on our business. Many of these, and other risks and uncertainties, are discussed in further detail in Item 1A. of CTS most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings made with the SEC. CTS undertakes no obligation to publicly update CTS forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof, including market or industry changes. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk. 
 34 

Item 4. Control s and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within CTS have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II - OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are involved in litigation with respect to matters arising from the ordinary conduct of our business, and currently certain claims are pending against us. In the opinion of management, we believe we have established adequate accruals pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for our expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based on presently available information. However, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
 See Note 11 "Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to our risk factors from those contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 On February 2, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 100 million of its common stock. The share repurchase program has no set expiration date and supersedes and replaces the repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in February 2023.
