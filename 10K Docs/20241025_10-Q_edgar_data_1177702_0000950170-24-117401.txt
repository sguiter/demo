The Company s liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investment in new equipment, land and structures, information technology and letters of credit required under insurance programs, as well as funding working capital requirements. Credit Arrangements Revolving Credit Facility The Company is a party to an unsecured credit agreement with its banking group (the Revolving Credit Facility), which provides up to a million revolving line of credit through February 2028. The Revolving Credit Facility contains an accordion feature that allows the Company to increase the size of the facility by up to million, subject to certain conditions and availability of lender commitments. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Company s election at a variable rate equal to (a) one, three or six month term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus , or (b) an alternate base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is between and per annum for term SOFR loans and between and per annum for alternate base rate loans, in each case based on the Company s consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio. The Company also accrues fees based on the daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which is between and based on the Company s consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio . Under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is subject to a maximum consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio of less than to 1.00 with the potential to be temporarily increased in the event the Company makes an acquisition that meets certain criteria. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, if an event of default occurs, the banks will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings of million and outstanding letters of credit of million under the Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2023 , the Company had outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit of million under the Revolving Credit Facility.

(Prudential), and certain affiliates and managed accounts of Prudential (the Note Purchasers) which allows the Company, from time to time, to offer for sale to Prudential and its affiliates, in one or a series of transactions, senior notes of the Company, through November 9, 2026. Pursuant to the Shelf Agreement, on May 1, 2024, the Company issued senior promissory notes (the Initial Notes) in an aggregate principal amount of million to the Note Purchasers. The Initial Notes bear interest at per annum and mature five years after the date on which the Initial Notes were issued, on May 1, 2029, unless repaid earlier by the Company. The Initial Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or other senior promissory notes issued pursuant to the Shelf Agreement. Additional notes issued under the Shelf Agreement, if any, would bear interest at a rate per annum, and would have such other terms, as would be set forth in a confirmation of acceptance executed by the parties prior to the closing of the applicable sale transaction. The Shelf Agreement requires that the Company maintain a consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio of less than to 1.00, with limited exceptions. The Shelf Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions related to events of default. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, the holders of notes issued under the Shelf Agreement may require immediate payment of all amounts owing under such notes. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants under the Shelf Agreement at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Shelf Agreement of million and , respectively.

 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand the future prospects of a company and make informed investment decisions.

These factors and risks are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated by Part II, Item 1A. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 As a result of these and other factors, no assurance can be given as to our future results and achievements. Accordingly, a forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances and those future events or circumstances may not occur.

We are under no obligation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation, to update or alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by applicable law. 
 Executive Overview 
 The Company s business is highly correlated to non-service sectors of the general economy. The Company s strategy is to improve profitability by increasing yield, while also increasing volumes. Components of this strategy include building density in existing geographies and pursuing geographic and terminal expansion in an effort to promote profitable growth and improve our customer value proposition over time. The Company s business is labor intensive, capital intensive and service sensitive. The Company looks for opportunities to improve safety, cost effectiveness and asset utilization (primarily tractors and trailers). Pricing initiatives have had a positive impact on yield and profitability. The Company continues to execute targeted sales and marketing programs along with initiatives to align costs with volumes and improve customer satisfaction. Technology continues to be an important investment as we work towards improving customer experience, operational efficiencies and Company image. 
 Third Quarter Overview 
 The Company s operating revenue increased by 8.6 percent in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase resulted primarily from increases in shipments and tonnage. In the third quarter of 2024, LTL shipments per workday were up 8.5 percent and LTL tonnage per workday was up 7.7 percent compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Consolidated operating income was 125.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 128.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share were 3.46 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to diluted earnings per share of 3.67 in the prior year quarter. The operating ratio (operating expenses divided by operating revenue) was 85.1 percent in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 83.4 percent in the third quarter of 2023. The Company generated 419.0 million in net cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 416.3 million in the same period last year. The Company opened eleven new terminals and relocated one additional terminal during the third quarter of 2024.

General 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, as well as the critical accounting policies and estimates of Saia, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (together, the Company or Saia). 
 Saia is a transportation company headquartered in Johns Creek, Georgia that provides national less-than-truckload (LTL) services through a single integrated organization. While more than 97 percent of revenue is historically derived from transporting LTL shipments across 48 states, the Company also offers customers a wide range of other value-added services, including non-asset truckload, expedited transportation and logistics services across North America. 
 Our business is highly correlated to non-service sectors of the general economy. Our business also is impacted by a number of other factors as discussed under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors. The key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our network, as measured by our average daily shipments and tonnage; the prices we obtain for our services, as measured by revenue per hundredweight (a measure of yield) and revenue per shipment; our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries, wages and benefits; purchased transportation; claims and insurance expense; fuel and maintenance; and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels.

Quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue and volume 
 Consolidated revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 8.6 percent to 842.1 million primarily as a result of increases in shipments and tonnage partially as a result of the redistribution of freight due to a competitor bankruptcy in 2023. For the third quarter of 2024, Saia s LTL tonnage was up 9.4 percent to 1.6 million tons, and LTL shipments increased 10.2 percent to 2.4 million shipments. LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased 1.7 percent to 21.75 per hundredweight for the third quarter of 2024 as a result of changes in business mix and pricing actions. For the third quarter of 2024, approximately 75 percent of the Company s operating revenue was subject to specific customer price negotiations that occur throughout the year. The remaining 25 percent of operating revenue was subject to a general rate increase. For customers subject to a general rate increase, Saia implemented 7.5 and 6.5 percent general rate increases on December 4, 2023 and January 30, 2023, respectively. Competitive factors, customer turnover and mix changes impact the extent to which customer rate increases are retained over time. 
 Operating revenue includes revenue recognized from the Company s fuel surcharge program, which is designed to reduce exposure to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices by adjusting total freight charges to account for changes in the price of diesel fuel. The Company s fuel surcharge is generally based on the average national price for diesel fuel (as published by the United States Energy Information Administration) and is typically reset weekly. Fuel surcharges are widely accepted in the industry and are a significant component of revenue and pricing. Fuel surcharges are an integral part of customer contract negotiations, but represent only one portion of overall customer price negotiations, as customers may negotiate increases in base rates instead of increases in fuel surcharges or vice versa. Fuel surcharge revenue as a percentage of operating revenue decreased to 14.8 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 16.9 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as a result of decreases in the average cost of diesel fuel and changes in customer mix. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating revenues were 2.4 billion, up 13.6 percent from operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of increases in shipments and tonnage partially as a result of the redistribution of freight due to a competitor bankruptcy in 2023. Fuel surcharge revenue as a percentage of operating revenue decreased to 15.3 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 16.9 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of decreases in the average cost of diesel fuel and changes in customer mix. 
 Operating expenses and margin 
 Consolidated operating income was 125.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 128.4 million in the prior year quarter. Overall, the decrease in consolidated operating income was the result of increased operating expenses, primarily driven by the expanded footprint of opening eighteen new terminals and eight relocations during the past twelve months, partially offset by increased volumes during the third quarter of 2024. The third quarter of 2024 operating ratio (operating expenses divided by operating revenue) was 85.1 percent compared to 83.4 percent for the same period in 2023. 
 Salaries, wages and employees benefits increased 53.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. This change was primarily driven by increases in headcount, employee hours worked and training hours in response to overall increased volumes and expanded footprint, and by a Company-wide wage increase in July 2024 of approximately 4.1 percent. In addition, workers compensation expense increased by approximately 5.1 million related to new claims, unfavorable development on existing claims and increased headcount. Purchased transportation decreased 11.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in LTL purchased transportation miles as a result of workforce and network optimization. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased by 14.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 largely due to increased facility costs and administrative costs related to increased volumes and the expanded footprint. Claims and insurance expense in the third quarter of 2024 was 1.3 million higher than the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to increased claim activity and development of open cases. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 9.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to ongoing investments in revenue equipment, real estate and technology. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated operating income was 380.7 million, up 9.4 percent compared to 347.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in consolidated operating income was the result of increased volumes partially offset by increased operating expenses during the during the first nine months of 2024. 
 Salaries, wages and benefits increased 156.6 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year. This change was primarily driven by increased volumes and expanded footprint, and by a Company-wide wage increase in July 2024 of approximately 4.1 percent. In addition, other employee related costs increased, including increased training hours and unfavorable development of workers compensation claims. Purchased transportation increased 5.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 
 15 

compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased non-asset truckload volume. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies increased 56.5 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year largely due to increased facility costs and administrative costs related to increased volumes and expanded footprint. During the first nine months of 2024, claims and insurance expense was 6.5 million higher than the same period last year primarily due to increased claim activity and development of open claims. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 22.9 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to ongoing investments in revenue equipment and network expansion. 
 Other 
 Interest expense for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the same period in 2023 due to interest expense related to increased borrowings under the credit arrangements. 
 Interest income for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the same period in 2023 due to decreased deposit balances during the period. 
 The effective tax rate was 24.4 percent and 24.6 percent for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rate was 24.2 percent. 
 Net income was 92.7 million, or 3.46 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to net income of 98.2 million, or 3.67 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Net income was 286.0 million, or 10.68 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2024 compared to net income of 265.6 million, or 9.93 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2023. 
 Outlook 
 Our business remains highly correlated to non-service sectors of the general economy and competitive pricing pressures, as well as the success of Company-specific improvement initiatives. Our outlook is dependent on a number of external factors, including strength of the economy, inflation, labor availability, diesel fuel prices and supply chain constraints. The potential impact of these factors on our operations, financial performance and financial condition, as well as the impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives, remains uncertain and difficult to predict. We are continuing initiatives to improve and enhance customer service in an effort to support our ongoing pricing and business mix optimization, while seeking to control costs and improve productivity. Planned revenue initiatives include building density in our current geography, targeted marketing initiatives to grow revenue in more profitable areas, further expanding our geographic and terminal network, as well as pricing and mix management. On October 21, 2024, December 4, 2023 and January 30, 2023 Saia implemented 7.9, 7.5 and 6.5 percent general rate increases, respectively, for customers comprising approximately 25 percent of Saia s operating revenue. The extent of success of these revenue initiatives is impacted by what proves to be the underlying economic trends, competitor initiatives and other factors discussed under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 With our objective of building market share, including through our geographic and terminal expansion, we expect there to be numerous operating leverage cost benefits. Conversely, should the economy soften, we plan to match resources and capacity to shifting volume levels to lessen unfavorable operating leverage. The success of cost improvement initiatives is impacted by a number of factors, including the cost and availability of drivers, dock workers and personnel, and purchased transportation, diesel fuel and insurance costs and inflation. 
 Effective July 2024, the Company implemented a market competitive salary and wage increase for all employees. The increase was approximately 4.1 percent, and the Company anticipates the impact will be partially offset by productivity and efficiency gains. 
 See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more complete discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company s liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investment in new equipment, land and structures, information technology and letters of credit required under insurance programs, as well as funding working capital requirements. 
 Working capital/capital expenditures 
 Working capital at September 30, 2024 was 90.7 million, a decrease from 346.4 million at September 30, 2023. 
 Current assets at September 30, 2024 decreased by 208.2 million as compared to September 30, 2023, driven by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 234.9 million to fund the Yellow Corporation real estate acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in accounts 
 16 

receivable of 26.5 million. Current liabilities increased by 47.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 largely due to an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities.

Cash flows provided by operating activities were 419.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 416.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 868.2 million compared to 337.0 million in the same period last year, a 531.2 million increase. This increase resulted from the acquisition of terminals from Yellow Corporation in January 2024 in addition to increased purchases of revenue equipment to support higher volumes and expanded footprint. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 167.5 million compared to 17.4 million net cash used in financing activities during the same period last year, as a result of borrowings to fund capital expenditures during the first nine months of 2024. 
 The Company has historically generated cash flows from operations to fund a large portion of its capital expenditure requirements. The timing of capital expenditures can largely be managed around the seasonal working capital requirements of the Company. The Company believes it has adequate sources of capital to meet short-term liquidity needs through its cash on hand, operating cash flows and availability under its credit arrangements, discussed below. Future operating cash flows are primarily dependent upon the Company s profitability and its ability to manage its working capital requirements. 
 The Company currently anticipates that net capital expenditures in 2024 will be approximately 1 billion, subject to ongoing evaluation of market conditions. Anticipated capital expenditures for the remainder of the year include normal replacement cycles of revenue equipment, investments in technology and revenue equipment and real estate investments to support our growth initiatives, including the plan to open four additional terminals in the fourth quarter. Net capital expenditures were 873.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 and include 235.7 million for the acquisition of 17 Yellow Corporation freight terminals. Additionally, 7.9 million was used to fund the acquisition of Yellow Corporation's interest in leases for 11 freight terminals and the payment of cure costs. Approximately 90.3 million of the 2024 remaining capital budget was committed as of September 30, 2024. 
 Credit Arrangements 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 The Company is a party to an unsecured credit agreement with its banking group (the Revolving Credit Facility), which provides up to a 300 million revolving line of credit through February 2028. The Revolving Credit Facility contains an accordion feature that allows the Company to increase the size of the facility by up to 150 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of lender commitments. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Company s election at a variable rate equal to (a) one, three or six month term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10 , or (b) an alternate base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is between 1.00 and 1.75 per annum for term SOFR loans and between 0.00 and 0.75 per annum for alternate base rate loans, in each case based on the Company s leverage ratio, as defined in the agreement. The Company also accrues fees based on the daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which is between 0.0125 and 0.025 based on the Company s consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is subject to a maximum consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio of less than 3.50 to 1.00 with the potential to be temporarily increased in the event the Company makes an acquisition that meets certain criteria. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, if an event of default occurs, the banks will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024 the Company had outstanding borrowings of 83.0 million and outstanding letters of credit 32.2 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit 
 17 

of 32.1 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 184.8 million in availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Private Shelf Agreement 
 On November 9, 2023, the Company entered into a 350 million uncommitted Private Shelf Agreement (the Shelf Agreement), by and among the Company, PGIM, Inc. (Prudential), and certain affiliates and managed accounts of Prudential (the Note Purchasers) which allows the Company, from time to time, to offer for sale to Prudential and its affiliates, in one or a series of transactions, senior notes of the Company, through November 9, 2026. 
 Pursuant to the Shelf Agreement, on May 1, 2024, the Company issued senior promissory notes (the Initial Notes) in an aggregate principal amount of 100 million to the Note Purchasers. The Initial Notes bear interest at 6.09 per annum and mature five years after the date on which the Initial Notes were issued, on May 1, 2029, unless repaid earlier by the Company. The Initial Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or other senior promissory notes issued pursuant to the Shelf Agreement. 
 Additional notes issued under the Shelf Agreement, if any, would bear interest at a rate per annum, and would have such other terms, as would be set forth in a confirmation of acceptance executed by the parties prior to the closing of the applicable sale transaction. 
 The Shelf Agreement requires that the Company maintain a consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio of less than 3.50 to 1.00, with limited exceptions. The Shelf Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions related to events of default. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, the holders of notes issued under the Shelf Agreement may require immediate payment of all amounts owing under such notes. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants under the Shelf Agreement at September 30, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Shelf Agreement of 100.0 million and 0, respectively. 
 Finance Leases 
 The Company is obligated under finance leases with seven-year original terms covering certain revenue equipment. Total liabilities recognized under the finance leases were 8.0 million and 16.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Amortization of assets held under the finance leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense. The weighted average interest rates for the finance leases at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 4.1 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Contractual obligations for the Company are comprised of lease agreements, purchase obligations and long-term debt obligations. Contractual obligations for operating leases at September 30, 2024 totaled 140.7 million, including operating leases with original maturities of less than one year, which are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Contractual obligations in the form of finance leases were 8.2 million at September 30, 2024, which includes both principal and interest amounts. For the remainder of 2024, 3.9 million of interest payments are anticipated based on borrowings and commitments outstanding at September 30, 2024. See Note 5, Debt and Financing Arrangements, of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this 10-Q. Purchase obligations at September 30, 2024 were 90.5 million, including commitments of 90.3 million for capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility had 83.0 million outstanding principal balance and the Shelf Agreement had 100.0 million outstanding principal balance. 
 Other commercial commitments of the Company typically include letters of credit and surety bonds required for collateral towards insurance agreements. As of September 30, 2024 the Company had total outstanding letters of credit of 32.2 million and 60.4 million in surety bonds. 
 The Company has accrued approximately 4.6 million for uncertain tax positions and 0.6 million for interest and penalties related to the uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company has accrued 87.0 million for claims and insurance liabilities.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company is exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of interest rates and diesel fuel prices. To help mitigate our risk to rising diesel fuel prices, the Company has an established fuel surcharge program. The detail of the Company s debt structure is more fully described in Note 5, Debt and Financing Arrangements, of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. 
 The following table provides information about the Company s third-party financial instruments as of September 30, 2024. The table presents annual principal cash flows (in millions) and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates. The fair value of fixed rate debt is based on current market interest rates for similar types of financial instruments, reflective of level two inputs. The carrying amount of the Company s variable rate debt approximates fair value as interest rates approximate the current rates available to the Company.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Quarterly Controls Evaluation and Related CEO and CFO Certifications 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effective ness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (Disclosure Controls). The Disclosure Controls evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). 
 Based upon the controls evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s Disclosure Controls are effective to ensure that information the Company is required to disclose in reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 
 During the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are certifications of the CEO and the CFO, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act. This Controls and Procedures section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications. 
 Definition of Disclosure Controls 
 Disclosure Controls are controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported timely. Disclosure Controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s Disclosure Controls include components of its internal control over financial reporting which consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 The Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that its Disclosure Controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
