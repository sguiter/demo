Ending capitalized exploratory well costs 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no exploratory wells for which costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year. The Company assesses the need for an impairment of the capitalized costs for its proved natural gas and oil properties on a property basis. impairments were recognized to adjust the carrying value of the Company's proved natural gas and oil properties during any of the periods presented. Unproved natural gas and oil properties are also periodically assessed and any impairment in value is charged to expense. The costs related to unproved properties are transferred to proved natural gas and oil properties and amortized on an equivalent unit-of-production basis when they are reflected in proved natural gas and oil reserves. The Company determines the fair value of its natural gas and oil properties using a discounted cash flow model and proved and risk-adjusted probable natural gas and oil reserves. Undrilled acreage can also be valued based on sales transactions in comparable areas. Significant Level 3 assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted future cash flows included in the cash flow model include management's outlook for natural gas and oil prices, production costs, capital expenditures, and future production as well as estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves and risk-adjusted probable natural gas and oil reserves. Management's natural gas and oil price outlook is developed based on third-party longer-term price forecasts as of each measurement date. The expected future net cash flows are discounted using an appropriate discount rate in determining a property's fair value. It is reasonably possible that the Company's estimates of undiscounted future net cash flows attributable to its natural gas and oil properties may change in the future. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future cash flows include future adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved and appropriate risk-adjusted probable natural gas and oil reserves, results of future drilling activities, future prices for natural gas and oil, and increases or decreases in production and capital costs. As a result of these changes, there may be future impairments in the carrying values of these or other properties. 
 million as of September 30, 2024 that was recorded in 2018. The Company is not required to amortize goodwill as a charge to earnings; however, the Company is required to conduct an annual review of goodwill for impairment. The Company performs an annual assessment of goodwill on October 1 of each year and performs interim assessments if indicators of impairment are present. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded for the difference between fair value and carrying value. impairment indicators were identified during the periods presented. 
 million related to its corporate office, certain office equipment, vehicles and drilling rigs with corresponding short-term and long-term liabilities. The value of the lease assets and liabilities are determined based upon discounted future minimum cash flows contained within each of the respective contracts. The Company determines if contracts contain a lease at inception of the contract. To the extent that contract terms representing a lease are identified, leases are identified as being either an operating lease or a finance-type lease. Comstock currently has no finance-type leases. Right-of-use lease assets representing the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the related lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments under the terms of the contracts. Short-term leases that have an initial term of one year or less are not capitalized; however, amounts paid for those leases are included as part of its lease cost disclosures. Short-term lease costs exclude expenses related to leases with a lease term of one month or less. Leases for the right to explore for and develop natural gas and oil reserves and the related rights to use the land associated with those leases are reflected as natural gas and oil properties. Comstock contracts for a variety of equipment used in its natural gas and oil exploration and development activities. Contract terms for this equipment vary broadly, including the contract duration, pricing, scope of services included along with the equipment, cancellation terms, and rights of substitution, among others. The Company's drilling and completion operations routinely change due to changes in commodity prices, demand for natural gas and oil, and the overall operating and economic environment. Accordingly,

 drilling rig contracts with a term with options to extend the term by mutual agreement at mutually acceptable terms or terminate the contracts at any time without default by the lessor. The Company's other drilling rig contracts are presently either for periods of less than one year, or they are on terms that provide for cancellation with or advance notice without a specified expiration date. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use lease assets for contracts less than one year. The costs associated with drilling and completion operations are accounted for under the successful efforts method, which generally require that these costs be capitalized as part of our proved natural gas and oil properties on our balance sheet unless they are incurred on exploration wells that are unsuccessful, in which case they are charged to exploration expense.

As of September 30, 2024, Comstock had PSUs outstanding with a weighted average grant date fair value of per unit.

 primary products in its statements of operations. Revenues are recognized upon the transfer of produced volumes to the Company's customers, who take control of the volumes and receive all the benefits of ownership upon delivery at designated sales points. Gas services revenues represent sales of natural gas purchased for resale from unaffiliated third parties and fees received for gathering and treating services provided by PGS to third parties. Revenues are recognized upon completion of the gathering and treating of contracted natural gas volumes and delivery of purchased natural gas volumes to the Company's customers. Profits and losses earned

 days following each production month and are cancellable upon days' notice by either party for oil and vary for natural gas based upon the terms set out in the confirmations between both parties. Prices for sales of natural gas and oil are generally based upon terms that are common in the oil and gas industry, including index or spot prices, location and quality differentials, as well as market supply and demand conditions. As a result, prices for natural gas and oil routinely fluctuate based on changes in these factors. Prices for gathering and treating services are generally fixed in nature but can vary due to the quality of the gas being treated. Each unit of production (thousand cubic feet of natural gas and barrel of crude oil) represents a separate performance obligation under the Company's contracts since each unit has economic benefit on its own and each is priced separately according to the terms of the contracts. Comstock has elected to exclude all taxes from the measurement of transaction prices, and its revenues are reported net of royalties and exclude revenue interests owned by others because the Company acts as an agent when selling natural gas and oil on behalf of royalty owners and working interest owners. Revenue is recorded in the month of production based on an estimate of the Company's share of volumes produced and prices realized. Gas services revenue is recorded in the month the services are performed and purchased gas is sold based on an estimate of natural gas volumes and contract prices. The Company recognizes any differences between estimates and actual amounts received in the month when payment is received. Historically, differences between estimated revenues and actual revenues received have not been significant. The amount of natural gas or oil sold may differ from the amount to which the Company is entitled based on its revenue interests in the properties. The Company did not have any significant imbalance positions at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. The Company recognized accounts receivable of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, from purchasers for contracts where performance obligations have been satisfied and an unconditional right to consideration exists.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million outstanding under a bank credit facility. Aggregate commitments under the bank credit facility are billion, which matures on November 15, 2027. Borrowings under the bank credit facility are subject to a borrowing base, which is currently set at billion. The borrowing base is re-determined on a semi-annual basis and upon the occurrence of certain other events. Borrowings under the bank credit facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and bear interest at the Company's option, at either SOFR plus to or an alternate base rate plus to , in each case depending on the utilization of the borrowing base. Additionally, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024 through the second quarter of 2025, the bank credit facility will bear interest at the Company's option, at either SOFR plus to or an alternate base rate plus to , with either option also based on the utilization of the borrowing base. Beginning in the third quarter of 2025 through maturity, the bank credit facility will bear interest at the Company's option, at either SOFR plus to or an alternate base rate plus to , with either option also based on the utilization of the borrowing base. The Company also pays a commitment fee of to on the unused portion of the borrowing base. The bank credit facility places certain restrictions upon the Company's and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends, repurchase common stock, make certain loans, investments and divestitures and redeem the senior notes. The only financial covenants are the maintenance of a leverage ratio of less than to 1.0, which reduces to to 1.0 at June 30, 2025 and to to 1.0 at September 30, 2025, and an adjusted current ratio of at least to 1.0. The Company was in compliance with the covenants as of September 30, 2024. In April 2024, the Company issued million principal amount of senior notes due 2029 (the "New 2029 Notes") in a private placement and received net proceeds after offering costs and deducting the initial purchasers' discounts of million , which were used to pay down the outstanding borrowings on the Company's bank credit facility.

Revenues 
 Natural gas and oil sales of 253.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 51.8 million (17 as compared to 305.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower natural gas prices realized in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2023. Our natural gas production for the third quarter of 2024 increased 2 to 133.1 billion cubic feet ("Bcf") (1.4 Bcf per day) and was sold at an average price of 1.90 per thousand cubic feet ("Mcf"), which declined 18 from the average realized natural gas price in the third quarter of 2023. Natural gas production for the third quarter of 2023 was 130.5 Bcf (1.4 Bcf per day) and was sold at an average price of 2.33 per Mcf. 
 Natural gas and oil sales of 759.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 156.0 million (17 as compared to 915.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily due to 21 lower natural gas prices during the first nine months of 2024 as compared with 2023 prices. Our natural gas production for the first nine months of 2024 increased 5 to 403.4 Bcf (1.5 Bcf per day), and was sold at an average price of 1.87 per Mcf as compared to 383.9 Bcf (1.4 Bcf per day) sold at an average price of 2.37 per Mcf in the first nine months of 2023.

Gas service revenues of 50.8 million decreased 20.4 million (29 for the third quarter of 2024 from 71.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Gas service revenues of 127.9 million decreased 111.5 million (47 for the first nine months of 2024 from 239.4 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decreases were primarily due to lower natural gas prices related to sales of natural gas purchased to utilize our excess transport capacity. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Our production and ad valorem taxes decreased 12.8 million (50 to 12.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 25.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased 10.2 million (17 to 49.7 million for the first nine months of 2024 from 59.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decreases were primarily due to a lower statutory production tax rate in Louisiana and lower production taxes in Texas from lower natural gas and oil sales. 
 Gathering and transportation costs for the third quarter of 2024 increased 7.0 million (15 to 54.0 million as compared to 47.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Gathering and transportation costs for the first nine months of 2024 increased 12.5 million (9 to 150.5 million as compared to 138.0 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increases were due to production growth in areas with higher average gathering and transportation rates. 
 Our lease operating expense of 29.2 million 0.22 per Mcfe) for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 2.4 million (8 from lease operating expense of 31.7 million 0.24 per Mcfe) for the third quarter of 2023. Lease operating expense of 99.1 million 0.25 per Mcfe) for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 1.4 million (1 from lease operating expense of 100.5 million 0.26 per Mcfe) for the first nine months of 2023. The decreases for both periods were primarily due to lower water disposal and other production costs in 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Gas service expenses of 52.6 million decreased 15.0 million (22 for the third quarter of 2024 from 67.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. Gas service expenses of 132.8 million decreased 91.5 million (41 for the first nine months of 2024 from 224.3 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decreases in both periods were primarily due to lower natural gas prices related to purchases of third party natural gas for resale. 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD A") increased 60.2 million to 208.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 148.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. Our DD A per equivalent Mcf produced was 1.56 per Mcfe for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.13 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. DD A increased 170.9 million to 593.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 from 422.4 million during the first nine months of 2023. Our DD A per equivalent Mcf produced was 1.47 per Mcfe for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.10 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the DD A rate for both periods was primarily due to lower estimated proved undeveloped reserves which were determined using lower natural gas prices. 
 General and administrative expenses, which are reported net of overhead reimbursements, increased to 9.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 9.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, which was primarily due to higher employee compensation. General and administrative expenses decreased to 29.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 32.0 million during the first nine months of 2023, which was primarily due to lower employee compensation. 
 We use derivative financial instruments as part of our price risk management program to protect our capital investments. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we had net gains related to our derivative financial instruments of 75.2 million, as compared to net gains on derivative financial instruments of 14.3 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Realized net gains from our price risk management program were 51.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to realized net gains of 10.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Net gains on derivative financial instruments were 89.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to net gains of 76.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. Realized net gains from our price risk

COMSTOCK RESOURCES, INC. 

 management program were 160.0 million for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to realized net gains of 76.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. 
 Interest expense was 54.5 million and 43.6 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 156.0 million and 121.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in interest expense for both periods was due primarily to the issuance of an additional 400.0 million principal amount of senior notes and higher interest rates. 
 Income taxes for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were a benefit of 14.7 million and a provision of 3.6 million, respectively. Income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were a benefit of 69.1 million and a provision of 28.9 million, respectively. Income tax expense for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflect an effective tax rate of 36.4 and 19.7 , respectively. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflect an effective tax rate of 29.7 and 21.8 , respectively. The difference between the federal statutory tax rate of 21 and our effective rate is primarily attributable to the impact of state income taxes and revisions to the estimated future utilization of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. 
 As a result of continued lower natural gas prices, we reported a net loss of 25.7 million, or 0.09 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Loss from operations for the third quarter of 2024 was 61.3 million. We reported net income of 14.7 million or 0.05 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, we reported a net loss of 163.4 million or 0.57 per share. Loss from operations for the first nine months of 2024 was 166.7 million. We reported net income of 103.5 million or 0.37 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Cash flows from operating activities. Net cash provided by our operating activities decreased 435.4 million (55 to 353.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 788.6 million in the same period in 2023. The decrease was due primarily to lower natural gas prices. 
 Issuance of 6.75 Senior Notes. In April 2024, we issued 400.0 million principal amount of 6.75 senior notes due 2029 in a private placement and received net proceeds after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts of 365.2 million, which were used to pay down the outstanding borrowings on the Company's bank credit facility. 
 Proceeds from asset sales. In the first nine months of 2024, we sold our interest in certain non-operated properties for net proceeds of 1.2 million. In the first nine months of 2023, we sold our interest in certain non-operated properties for net proceeds of 41.3 million.

 Capital expenditures. The decrease in capital expenditures of 315.0 million was primarily due to lower drilling and completion activity in the first nine months of 2024. The 87.9 million of unproved property acquisitions in 2024 included the acquisition of 189,000 net acres in our Western Haynesville area from an unaffiliated third party for 50.0 million.

We drilled 35 (29.7 net) wells and completed 41 (35.9 net) Haynesville and Bossier shale operated wells during the first nine months of 2024. We currently expect to spend an additional 225 million to 275 million in the remaining three months of 2024 on drilling, completion, infrastructure and other activity. 
 Issuance of common stock. In the first nine months of 2024, we issued 12,500,000 shares of common stock to two entities controlled by our majority stockholder in a private placement, receiving proceeds of 100.5 million. 
 Common stock dividends. During the first nine months of 2023, we paid quarterly cash dividends of 0.125 per common share to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2023, June 1, 2023 and September 1, 2023, respectively. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.1 billion of liquidity, comprised of 1,085.0 million of unused borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility and 13.8 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. Our short and long-term capital requirements consist primarily of funding our development and exploration activities, acquisitions, payments of contractual obligations and debt service. 
 We expect to fund our future development and exploration activities with future operating cash flow and borrowings under our bank credit facility. The timing of most of our future capital expenditures is discretionary because of our limited number of material long-term capital expenditure commitments. Consequently, we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of our capital expenditures as circumstances warrant. We believe that our cash provided by operations and borrowings available under our bank credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. If our plans or assumptions change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to seek additional capital, including debt or equity financing. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain such capital, or if such capital is available, that we will be able to obtain it on acceptable terms. 
 We do not have a specific acquisition budget for the remainder of 2024 because the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable. We intend to use our cash flows from operations, borrowings under our bank credit facility, or other debt or equity financing to the extent available, to finance such acquisitions. The availability and attractiveness of these sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors, some of which will relate to our financial condition and performance and some of which will be beyond our control, such as prevailing interest rates, natural gas and oil prices and other market conditions. Lack of access to the debt or equity markets due to general economic conditions could impede our ability to complete acquisitions. 
 22 

COMSTOCK RESOURCES, INC. 

 At September 30, 2024, we had 415.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility. Aggregate commitments under our bank credit facility are 1.5 billion, which matures on November 15, 2027. Borrowings under our bank credit facility are subject to a borrowing base, which was redetermined on October 30, 2024 and currently set at 2.0 billion. The borrowing base is re-determined on a semi-annual basis and upon the occurrence of certain other events. Borrowings under our bank credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries and bear interest at our option. Additionally, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024 through the second quarter of 2025, the bank credit facility will bear interest at our option at either adjusted SOFR plus 2.25 to 3.25 or an alternate base rate plus 1.25 to 2.25 , in each case depending on the utilization of the borrowing base. Beginning in the third quarter of 2025 through maturity, borrowings under our bank credit facility will bear interest at our option, at either SOFR plus 2.0 to 3.0 or an alternate base rate plus 1.0 to 2.0 , also in each case depending on the utilization of the borrowing base. We also pay a commitment fee of 0.375 to 0.50 on the unused portion of the borrowing base. Our bank credit facility places certain restrictions upon our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends, repurchase common stock, make certain loans, investments and divestitures and redeem the senior notes. The only financial covenants are the maintenance of a leverage ratio of less than 4.0 to 1.0, which reduces to 3.75 to 1.0 at June 30, 2025 and to 3.5 to 1.0 at September 30, 2025, and an adjusted current ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with the covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 F ederal and State Taxation 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 754.1 million in U.S. federal net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards and 1.7 billion in certain state NOL carryforwards. As a result of the change of control in August 2018, our ability to use NOLs to reduce taxable income is limited. If we do not generate a sufficient level of taxable income prior to the expiration of the pre-2018 NOL carryforward periods, then we will lose the ability to apply those NOLs as offsets to future taxable income. We estimate that 740.6 million of the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and 1.2 billion of the estimated state NOL carryforwards will expire unused. 
 Our federal income tax returns for the years subsequent to December 31, 2019 remain subject to examination. Our income tax returns in major state income tax jurisdictions remain subject to examination for various periods subsequent to December 31, 2020. Currently, we are under examination with the state of Louisiana and believe that our significant filing positions are highly certain and that all of our other significant income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained under audit or the final resolution would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we have not established any significant reserves for uncertain tax positions.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Natural Gas and Oil Prices 
 Our financial condition, results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of natural gas and oil. These commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Factors influencing natural gas and oil prices include the level of global demand for oil, the foreign supply of natural gas and oil, the effect of the war in Ukraine and the geopolitical response to Russia's invasion, the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries, weather conditions that determine the demand for natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall economic conditions. It is impossible to predict future natural gas and oil prices with any degree of certainty. Sustained weakness in natural gas and oil prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and may also reduce the amount of natural gas and oil reserves that we can produce economically. Any reduction in our natural gas and oil reserves, including reductions due to price fluctuations, can have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities. Similarly, any improvements in natural gas and oil prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition, results of operations and capital resources. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had natural gas price swaps to hedge approximately 64.4 Bcf of our 2024 natural gas production at an average price of 3.54 per MMBtu and approximately 136.9 Bcf and 109.5 Bcf of our 2025 and 2026 production, respectively, at an average price of 3.51 per MMBtu. We also had natural gas collars to hedge approximately 54.8 Bcf of our 2025 production at an average ceiling price of 3.80 and an average floor price of 3.50 and natural gas collars to hedge approximately 91.3 Bcf of our 2026 production at an average ceiling price of 3.98 and an average floor price of 3.50. None of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral provisions that could require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement date. 
 An increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas on September 30, 2024 would decrease the fair value of our natural gas price swaps and collars by approximately 115.3 million. A decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas on September 30, 2024 would increase the fair value of our natural gas price swaps and collars by approximately 115.2 million. The impact of hypothetical changes in market prices of natural gas on our natural gas derivative financial instruments does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical changes in market prices of natural gas may have on our physical sales of natural gas. Since our outstanding natural gas derivative financial instruments hedge only a portion of our forecasted physical gas production, a positive or negative impact to the fair value of our natural gas derivative financial instruments would be partially offset by our physical sales of natural gas. 
 Interest Rates 
 At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 3.0 billion principal amount of long-term debt outstanding. 965.0 million of our long-term debt bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.875 and 1.62 billion of our long-term debt bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.75 . As of September 30, 2024, the fair market value of the 5.875 senior notes due in 2030 and the 6.75 senior notes due in 2029 was 897.5 million and 1.58 billion, respectively, based on the market price of approximately 93 and 97 , respectively, of the face amount of such debt. At September 30, 2024, we had 415.0 million outstanding under our bank credit facility, which is subject to variable rates of interest that are tied to SOFR or the corporate base rate, at our option. Any increase in these interest rates would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
