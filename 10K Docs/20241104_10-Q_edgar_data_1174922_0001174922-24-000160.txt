In connection with, and as provided under, the Third Retail Term Loan Amendment, the Borrowers (a) made a principal prepayment of the term loan in the amount of million, and (b) to mitigate interest rate risk, entered into an interest rate swap agreement maturing in February 2027, which effectively fixes the variable component of the interest rate on the term loan at through such date.

Adjusted Property EBITDAR is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDAR as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. The Company also presents Adjusted Property EBITDAR because it is used by some investors to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDAR as a supplement to GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDAR calculations preopening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company's performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, Adjusted Property EBITDAR does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted Property EBITDAR. Also, the Company's calculation of Adjusted Property EBITDAR may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

Property charges and other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included million of expensed project costs related to a discontinued development project, partially offset by a gain of million related to the sale of certain Wynn Interactive assets.

Overview 
 
 We are a designer, developer, and operator of integrated resorts featuring luxury hotel rooms, high-end retail space, an array of dining and entertainment options, meeting and convention facilities, and gaming, all supported by an unparalleled focus on our guests, our people, and our community. Through our approximately 72 ownership of Wynn Macau, Limited ("WML"), our concessionaire Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A. ("Wynn Macau SA") operates two integrated resorts in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China ("Macau"), Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau (collectively, our "Macau Operations"). In Las Vegas, Nevada, we operate and, with the exception of certain retail space, own 100 of Wynn Las Vegas. We are a 50.1 owner and managing member of a joint venture that owns and leases certain retail space at Wynn Las Vegas (the "Retail Joint Venture"). We refer to Wynn Las Vegas, Encore, an expansion at Wynn Las Vegas, and the Retail Joint Venture as our Las Vegas Operations. In Everett, Massachusetts, we operate Encore Boston Harbor, an integrated resort. The results of Wynn Interactive Ltd. ("Wynn Interactive") are included in Corporate and other. 
 
 The Company has a 40 equity interest in Island 3 AMI FZ-LLC ("Island 3"), an unconsolidated affiliate, which is constructing an integrated resort property ("Wynn Al Marjan Island") in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. 

Key Operating Measures 
 
 Certain key operating measures specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations are presented. These key operating measures are presented as supplemental disclosures because management and/or certain investors use these measures to better understand period-over-period fluctuations in our casino and hotel operating revenues. These key operating measures are defined below: 
 
 Table drop in mass market for our Macau Operations is the amount of cash that is deposited in a gaming table's drop box plus cash chips purchased at the casino cage. 
 Table drop for our Las Vegas Operations is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box. 
 Table drop for Encore Boston Harbor is the amount of cash and gross markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box. 
 Rolling chips are non-negotiable identifiable chips that are used to track turnover for purposes of calculating incentives within our Macau Operations' VIP program. 
 Turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our Macau Operations' VIP program. 
 Table games win is the amount of table drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenues. Table games win is before discounts, commissions and the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis. Table games win does not include poker rake. 
 Slot machine win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenues. Slot machine win is after adjustment for progressive accruals and free play, but before discounts and the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis. 
 Poker rake is the portion of cash wagered by patrons in our poker rooms that is retained by the casino as a service fee, after adjustment for progressive accruals, but before the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, 
 26 

Table of Contents 

food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis. Poker tables are not included in our measure of average number of table games. 
 Average daily rate ("ADR") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including complimentaries (less service charges, if any), by total rooms occupied. 
 Revenue per available room ("REVPAR") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including complimentaries (less service charges, if any), by total rooms available. 
 Occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms, including complimentary rooms, by the total rooms available. 
 
 Below is a discussion of the methodologies used to calculate win percentages at our resorts. 
 
 In our mass market operations in Macau, customers may purchase cash chips at either the gaming tables or at the casino cage. The measurements from our VIP and mass market operations are not comparable as the measurement method used in our mass market operations tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table and at the casino cage, while the measurement method from our VIP operations tracks the sum of all losing wagers. Accordingly, the base measurement from the VIP operations is much larger than the base measurement from the mass market operations. As a result, the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is lower in the VIP operations when compared to the mass market operations. 
 
 In our VIP operations in Macau, customers primarily purchase rolling chips from the casino cage and can only use them to make wagers. Winning wagers are paid in cash chips. The loss of the rolling chips in the VIP operations is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating VIP win percentage. It is customary in Macau to measure VIP play using this rolling chip method. We typically expect our win as a percentage of turnover from these operations to be within the range of 3.1 to 3.4 . 
 
 In Las Vegas, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables in exchange for cash and markers. Customers may then redeem markers at the gaming tables or at the casino cage. The cash and markers, net of redemptions, used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. This is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage. Each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. Our expected table games win percentage is 22 to 26 . 
 
 At Encore Boston Harbor, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables in exchange for cash and markers. Customers may then redeem markers only at the casino cage. The cash and gross markers used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. This is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage. Each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. Our expected table games win percentage is 18 to 22 .

 The increase in operating revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase of 56.9 million from Wynn Macau as a result of higher gaming volumes, partially offset by a decrease in operating revenues at Wynn Interactive of 22.5 million following the closure of Wynn Interactive's digital sports betting and casino gaming

business, and a decrease in operating revenues at our Las Vegas Operations of 11.8 million primarily due to lower table games win. 
 
 The decrease in net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses in connection with the closure of Wynn Interactive's digital sports betting and casino gaming business. The decrease in net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by 130.0 million of forfeitures pursuant to the NPA, as described in Note 15, "Commitments and Contingencies" of Item 1 "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements."

 The decrease in total operating expenses was primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairments recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2023 in connection with the closure of Wynn Interactive's digital sports betting and casino gaming business, as well as decreased entertainment, retail and other expenses related to Wynn Interactive's operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Casino expenses increased 29.9 million and 8.2 million at Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace, respectively. These increases resulted from higher operating costs, including 26.3 million and 3.3 million in incremental gaming tax expense at Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace, respectively, driven by an increase in casino revenues. 
 
 Room expenses increased 3.4 million at our Las Vegas Operations as a result of higher operating costs, commensurate with the increase in room revenues. 
 
 Entertainment, retail and other expenses decreased 27.3 million at Corporate and other as a result of decreased operating costs related to Wynn Interactive. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 18.3 million at Encore Boston Harbor as result of certain furniture, fixtures and equipment assets being fully depreciated five years after the opening of the property in June of 2019. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized impairment of goodwill and other finite-lived intangible assets of 72.1 million and 21.9 million, respectively, as a result of our decision to close Wynn Interactive's digital sports betting and casino gaming business. 
 
 Property charges and other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of 130.0 million of forfeitures pursuant to the NPA and the Company's 9.4 million contribution towards a legal settlement.

Other non-operating income and expenses 
 
 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased 20.6 million due to a decrease in the weighted average debt balance, from 12.33 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 11.40 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate, from 6.18 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.67 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 We recorded interest income of 30.7 million and 46.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents held at financial institutions. 
 
 We incurred a foreign currency remeasurement gain of 21.3 million and 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The impact of the exchange rate fluctuation of the Macau pataca, in relation to the U.S. dollar, on the remeasurements of U.S. dollar denominated debt and other obligations from our Macau-related entities drove the variability between periods. 
 
 We recorded a loss of 5.5 million and 50.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, from change in derivatives fair value, primarily related to the conversion feature of the WML Convertible Bonds. 
 
 We recorded a 0.1 million loss on debt financing transactions in the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to the WRF Credit Facility Agreement Amendment. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 2.9 million gain on debt financing transactions related to the repurchase of the tendered 2025 WRF Senior Notes. 
 
 Income taxes 
 
 We recorded an income tax expense of 17.1 million and a benefit 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to operating profits.

 We recognized net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of 26.6 million and 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are primarily related to the noncontrolling interests' share of net income or loss attributable to WML.

 Casino expenses increased 162.9 million and 135.7 million at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau, respectively. These increases resulted from higher operating costs, including increases of 141.8 million and 121.9 million in incremental gaming tax expense at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau, respectively, driven by the increase in casino revenues. 
 
 Room expenses increased 17.7 million at our Las Vegas Operations as a result of higher operating costs, commensurate with the increase in room revenues. 
 
 Food and beverage expenses increased 23.8 million and 17.2 million at our Las Vegas Operations and our Macau Operations, respectively, as a result of higher operating costs related to increases in food and beverage revenues. 
 
 Entertainment, retail and other expenses decreased 94.0 million at Corporate and other as a result of decreased operating costs related to Wynn Interactive. This decrease is partially offset by an increase of 24.4 million at our Las Vegas Operations primarily due to increased costs from entertainment venue and convention-related revenue. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized impairment of goodwill and other finite-lived intangible assets of 72.1 million and 22.4 million, respectively, as a result of our decision to close Wynn Interactive's online sports betting and casino gaming business.

Other non-operating income and expenses 
 
 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased 41.6 million primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average debt balance, from 12.48 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 11.58 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 We recorded interest income of 105.8 million and 130.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents held at financial institutions. 
 
 We incurred a foreign currency remeasurement gain of 25.3 million and a loss of 19.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 We recorded a loss of 7.9 million from changes in derivatives fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to the interest rate collar on the Retail Term Loan . We recorded a loss of 3.3 million from changes in derivatives fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to the conversion feature of the WML Convertible Bonds.

We recorded a 12.7 million loss on debt financing transactions for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to the issuance of the 2031 WRF Senior Notes and the repurchase of the early tendered 2025 WRF Senior Notes. 
 
 Income taxes 
 
 We recorded income tax expense of 45.1 million and 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income tax expense in 2024 primarily relates to U.S.-based operating profits as well as an increase in non-deductible expenses. Income tax expense in 2023 primarily related to operating profits. 
 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 93.3 million and 7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are primarily related to the noncontrolling interests' share of net income from WML.

Segment Information 
 
 As further described in Item 1 "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements," Note 17, "Segment Information," we use Adjusted Property EBITDAR to manage the operating results of our segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening expenses, property charges and other expenses, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other expenses (including intercompany golf course, meeting and convention, and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, change in derivatives fair value, loss (gain) on debt financing transactions, and other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDAR as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. We also present Adjusted Property EBITDAR because it is used by some investors to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDAR as a supplement to GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDAR calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, Adjusted Property EBITDAR does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted Property EBITDAR. Also, our calculation of Adjusted Property EBITDAR may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. 
 
 The following table summarizes Adjusted Property EBITDAR (dollars in thousands) for Wynn Palace, Wynn Macau, Las Vegas Operations, Encore Boston Harbor, and Corporate and other as reviewed by management and summarized in Item 1 "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements," Note 17, "Segment Information." That footnote also presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Property EBITDAR to net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited.

 Our cash flows were as follows (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Cash Flows - Summary 2024 2023 Cash flows from operating activities 947,175 806,550 Cash flows from investing activities: Capital expenditures, net of construction payables and retention (292,690) (329,428) Investment in unconsolidated affiliates (454,980) (52,270) Purchase of investments (786,519) Proceeds from maturity of investments 850,000 Purchase of intangible and other assets (2,615) (10,651) Proceeds from sale of assets and other 26,797 490 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 126,512 (1,178,378) Cash flows from financing activities: Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt 1,283,794 1,200,000 Repayments of long-term debt (1,251,210) (1,522,812) Repurchase of common stock (198,249) (71,019) Proceeds from exercise of stock options 1,017 1,965 Distribution to noncontrolling interest (10,601) (15,929) Dividends paid (112,045) (56,720) Finance lease payments (14,498) (14,407) Payments for financing costs (31,459) (41,160) Other (4,486) (7,773) Net cash used in financing activities (337,737) (527,855) Effect of exchange rate on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 3,351 (3,721) Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 739,301 (903,404) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Our operating cash flows primarily consist of operating income (excluding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges), interest paid and earned, and changes in working capital accounts such as receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, and payables. Our table games play is a mix of cash play and credit play, while our slot machine play is conducted primarily on a cash basis. A significant portion of our table games revenue is attributable to the play of a limited number of premium customers who gamble on credit. The ability to collect these gaming receivables may impact our operating cash flow for the period. Our rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail and other revenue is conducted on a cash and credit basis. Accordingly, operating cash flows will be impacted by changes in operating income and accounts receivable, net. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to increased revenues from our Macau Operations and our Las Vegas Operations, which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses associated with higher business volumes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to increased revenues from our Macau Operations and our Las Vegas Operations, which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses associated with higher business volumes.

 In addition to the cash and cash equivalents and available revolver borrowing capacity presented above, as of September 30, 2024, we also held restricted cash of 605.9 million and 600.0 million at WRF and WML, respectively, in trust accounts for the October 2024 repurchase or payment of the Wynn Las Vegas 5 1/2 Senior Notes due 2025 and WML 4 7/8 Senior Notes due 2024, as discussed below. 
 
 Wynn Macau, Limited and subsidiaries . WML generates cash from our Macau Operations and may utilize proceeds from the WM Cayman II Revolver as needed. We expect to use this cash to service our WML Senior Notes, WM Cayman II Revolver, and WML Convertible Bonds, to pay dividends to shareholders of WML (of which we own approximately 72 ), and to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements at WML and our Macau Operations. 
 
 WML is a holding company and, as a result, its ability to pay dividends to WRF is dependent on WML receiving distributions from its subsidiaries. WML, as guarantor under the WM Cayman II Revolver facility agreement, may be subject to certain restrictions on payments of dividends or distributions to its shareholders, unless certain financial criteria have been satisfied. The WM Cayman II Revolver facility agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants and events of default customary for similar financings, including, but not limited to, restrictions on indebtedness to be incurred by WM Cayman II or its subsidiaries. 
 
 In May 2024, the WML Board of Directors announced an amendment to WML's dividend policy, pursuant to which the WML Board of Directors will meet semiannually to consider the declaration of dividends, and may also meet at any time during the year as the WML Board of Directors deems fit to consider the declaration of special dividends. On June 19, 2024, WML paid a cash dividend of HK 0.075 per share for a total U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately 50.4 million in respect of the year ended December 31, 2023. Our share of this dividend was 36.0 million. On September 12, 2024, WML paid a cash dividend of HK 0.075 per share for a total U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately 50.5 million in respect of the six months ended June 30, 2024. Our share of this dividend was 36.1 million. 
 
 In September 2024, WM Cayman II and WML entered into an amendment agreement to its existing facility agreement to extend the maturity date of the outstanding loans under the existing facility agreement for three years to September 2028. 
 
 In October 2024, we repaid the 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of WML's 4 7/8 Senior Notes due 2024 on their stated maturity date using short-term restricted cash held at WML. 
 
 If our portion of cash available for repatriation was repatriated on September 30, 2024, it would be subject to minimal U.S. taxes. 
 
 Wynn Resorts Finance, LLC and subsidiaries. Wynn Resorts Finance, LLC ("WRF" or "Wynn Resorts Finance") generates cash from distributions from its subsidiaries, which include our Macau Operations, Wynn Las Vegas, and Encore Boston Harbor, and capital contributions from Wynn Resorts, as required. In addition, WRF may utilize its available revolving borrowing capacity as needed. We expect to use this cash to service our WRF Credit Facilities, the WRF Senior Notes, and the Wynn Las Vegas Senior Notes, and to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements as needed. 
 
 WRF is a holding company and, as a result, its ability to pay dividends to Wynn Resorts is dependent on WRF receiving distributions from its subsidiaries. The WRF Credit Agreement contains customary negative and financial covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict WRF's ability to pay dividends or distributions and incur additional indebtedness.

In February 2024, WRF issued an additional 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7 1/8 Senior Notes due 2031 (the "2031 WRF Add-On Senior Notes") in a private offering. The 2031 WRF Add-On Senior Notes were issued at a price equal to 103.0 of the principal amount, for net proceeds of approximately 409.5 million. 
 
 In February and March 2024, we repurchased 800.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5 1/2 Senior Notes due 2025 (the "2025 WLV Senior Notes"), which consisted of i) 681.0 million aggregate principal amount of validly tendered notes repurchased at a price equal to 97.2 of the principal amount, plus accrued interest and an early tender premium of 20.3 million, and ii) 119.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased on a pro-rata basis at a price equal of 100 of the principal amount plus accrued interest under the terms of its indenture. Included in the 119.0 million repurchase was 3.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 WLV Senior Notes held by Wynn Resorts. We used the net proceeds from the 2031 WRF Add-On Senior Notes and cash held by WRF to purchase such validly tendered 2025 WLV Senior Notes and to pay the early tender premium and related fees and expenses. 
 
 In September 2024, WRF and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment (the "WRF Credit Agreement Amendment") to its existing credit agreement (the "WRF Credit Agreement"). The WRF Credit Agreement Amendment amends the WRF Credit Agreement to (i) extend the stated maturity date for lenders electing to extend their revolving commitments in an amount equal to approximately 68.7 million from September 20, 2024 to September 20, 2027, and (ii) extend the stated maturity date for lenders electing to extend their term loan commitments in an amount equal to approximately 71.8 million from September 20, 2024 to September 20, 2027. 
 
 Also in September 2024, WRF issued 800 million aggregate principal amount of 6 1/4 Senior Notes due 2033 (the "2033 WRF Senior Notes") in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2033 WRF Senior Notes were issued at par, for net proceeds of 795.0 million. A portion of the proceeds from the offering of the 2033 WRF Senior Notes was classified as short-term restricted cash as of September 30, 2024 within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and was used in October 2024 to repurchase the remaining outstanding 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of WLV 5.500 Senior Notes due 2025 at a price equal to 100.0 of the principal amount, plus accrued interest. Included in the 600.0 million repurchase was 16.7 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 WLV Senior Notes held by Wynn Resorts. 
 
 Wynn Resorts, Limited and other subsidiaries. Wynn Resorts, Limited is a holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries' ability to provide funds to us. Wynn Resorts, Limited and other primarily generates cash from royalty (including intellectual property license) and management agreements with our resorts, dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries, and the operations of the Retail Joint Venture of which we own 50.1 . Fees payable by Wynn Macau SA to Wynn Resorts, Limited under its intellectual property license agreement are capped at 140.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2024. We expect to use cash held by Wynn Resorts, Limited and other to service our Retail Term Loan, to fund working capital needs of our subsidiaries, pay dividends, make required capital contributions to the entity which owns the Wynn Al Marjan Island development, and for general corporate purposes. 
 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company determined not to proceed with its planned phased development project adjacent to Encore Boston Harbor, and expensed 61.5 million of costs, including 4.7 million of internally allocated overhead, that had been previously capitalized. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company contributed 18.2 million of cash into Island 3, bringing our life-to-date cash contributions to 532.6 million. The cash contributed in the quarter was used primarily to fund our pro rata portion of the purchase of approximately 155 acres of land underlying the Wynn Al Marjan Island integrated resort development site, including the remaining 70 acres of land on Island 3 for potential future development (the "Marjan Land Bank"). We estimate our remaining 40 pro-rata share of the required equity for the construction of the Wynn Al Marjan Island integrated resort is between 800 million and 875 million, inclusive of capitalized interest, fees, and certain improvements on the Island. Wynn Al Marjan Island is currently expected to open in 2027. 
 
 The Company paid a cash dividend of 0.25 per share in each of the quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024 and recorded 28.0 million in each of the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 and 27.7 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, against accumulated deficit. On November 4, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.25 per share on its common stock, payable on November 27, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 15, 2024.

In October 2024, we amended the retail term loan agreement to, among other things, extend the scheduled maturity date to July 2027 and provide for an interest rate adjustment. We also made a principal repayment of the term loan in the amount of 15.0 million. 
 
 Other Factors Affecting Liquidity 
 
 We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. 
 
 Legal proceedings in which we are involved also may impact our liquidity. No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of such proceedings. In addition, litigation inherently involves significant costs. For information regarding legal proceedings, see Note 15, "Commitments and Contingencies." 
 
 In April 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an equity repurchase program of up to 1.00 billion. Under the equity repurchase program, we may repurchase the Company's outstanding shares from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). As of September 30, 2024, we had 247.7 million in repurchase authority remaining under the program. 
 
 On November 1, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase a total of up to 1.0 billion of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock, increasing the previously available repurchase authorization by approximately 766 million. The equity repurchase program authorizes discretionary repurchases by the Company from time to time through open market purchases, including pursuant to plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchases, or block trades, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, and the equity repurchase program may be suspended, discontinued or accelerated at any time. 
 
 We have in the past repurchased, and in the future, we may periodically consider repurchasing our outstanding notes for cash. The amount of any shares and/or notes to be repurchased, as well as the timing of any repurchases, will be based on business, market and other conditions and factors, including price, contractual requirements or consents, and capital availability. 
 
 New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in domestic and international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any new development may require us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts, Limited or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas, Boston or Macau-related entities. 
 
 Contractual Commitments 
 
 Except as described below, there have been no material changes to the contractual obligations previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 As a result of the financing transactions described in our discussion of capital resources above, our long-term debt obligations decreased by 55.8 million in 2024 and 3.49 billion in 2025 and increased by 3.8 million in 2026, 662.3 million in 2027, 1.15 billion in 2028, and 1.20 billion thereafter. Our annual fixed interest payments are expected to decrease 12.8 million in 2024 and increase 65.8 million in 2025, 78.5 million in each of 2026, 2027, and 2028, and 271.0 million thereafter and our annual variable interest payments are expected to decrease 34.6 million in 2024 and increase 15.7 million in 2025, 110.2 million in 2026, 95.3 million in 2027, and 53.6 million in 2028. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 A description of our critical accounting policies is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes to these policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. 
 
 Additional information about market risks to which we are exposed is included within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Interest Rate Risks 
 
 One of our primary exposures to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long-term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings, supplemented by hedging activities as believed by us to be appropriate. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 79 of our long-term debt was based on fixed rates. Based on our outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2024 , an assumed 100 basis point change in the variable rates would cause our annual interest expense to change by 19.2 million. 
 
 In order to mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the Retail Term Loan, the Company previously entered into an interest rate collar with a notional value of 615.0 million, which expired on August 1, 2024. On October 2, 2024, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional value of 600.0 million, maturing in February 2027. The interest rate swap effectively fixes the variable component of the interest rate on the Retail Term Loan at 3.385 through February 2027. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risks 
 
 We expect most of the revenues and expenses for any casino that we operate in Macau will be denominated in Hong Kong dollars or Macau patacas; however, a significant portion of the debt issued by WML is denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rates resulting in weakening of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar could have materially adverse effects on our results, financial condition and ability to service debt. Based on our balances as of September 30, 2024, an assumed 1 change in the U.S. dollar/Hong Kong dollar exchange rate would cause a foreign currency transaction gain/loss of 41.6 million.

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the Company's CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the period covered by this report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act and were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Company's CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter to which this report relates that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
