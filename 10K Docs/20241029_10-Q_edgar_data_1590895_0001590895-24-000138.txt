 The Company classifies accruals for uncertain tax positions within Other long-term liabilities on the Balance Sheets, separate from any related income tax payable or deferred income taxes. Reserve amounts relate to any potential income tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions as well as potential interest or penalties associated with those liabilities. 
 Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use existing deferred tax assets. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company evaluated its forecasted adjusted taxable income and objectively verifiable evidence and placed substantial weight on its 2022 and 2023 quarterly earnings, adjusted for non-recurring items, including the interest expense disallowed under current tax law. Accordingly, the Company determined it was more likely than not that a portion of the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized and, as a result, during the second quarter of 2023, the Company reversed the valuation allowance related to these deferred tax assets and recorded an income tax benefit of million. The Company is still carrying a valuation allowance on certain federal and state deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized in the future. The Company has assessed the changes to the valuation allowance, including realization of the disallowed interest expense deferred tax asset, using the integrated approach. 
 The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the expected income tax provision based on the federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to an increase in federal and state valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets for excess business interest expense. 
 The income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the expected income tax provision based on the federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to an increase in federal and state valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets for excess business interest expense. The income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the expected income tax benefit based on the federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to the partial release of federal and state valuation allowances. 
 The Company, including its subsidiaries, files tax returns with federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company does not have tax sharing agreements with the other members within its consolidated group. The Company is subject to exam by various state and foreign tax authorities. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to US federal or state and local tax assessments by tax authorities for years before 2020, and it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next 12 months.

 Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Caesars to Adjusted EBITDA by Segment 
 Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a measure of the Company s performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenues less certain operating expenses and is comprised of net income (loss) before (i) interest income and interest expense, net of interest capitalized, (ii) income tax (benefit) provision, (iii) depreciation and amortization, and (iv) certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance at an operating property level. 
 In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA you should be aware that, in the future, we may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or unexpected items. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies within the industry. Adjusted EBITDA is included because management uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure performance and allocate resources, and believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with additional information consistent with that used by management.

 Investments and Partnerships 
 Pompano Joint Venture 
 In April 2018, we entered into a joint venture with Cordish Companies Cordish to plan and develop a mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination expected to be located on unused land adjacent to the casino and racetrack at our Pompano property. As the managing member, Cordish will operate the business and manage the development, construction, financing, marketing, leasing, maintenance and day-to-day operation of the various phases of the project. Additionally, Cordish will be responsible for the development of the master plan for the project with our input and will submit it for our review and approval. While we hold a 50 variable interest in the joint venture, we are not the primary beneficiary; as such, the investment

 Reportable Segments 
 Segment results in this MD A are presented consistent with the way our management reviews operating results, assesses performance and makes decisions on a significant market basis. Management views each of the Company s casinos as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, and their management and reporting structure. Our principal operating activities occur in four reportable segments: (1) Las Vegas, (2) Regional, (3) Caesars Digital, and (4) Managed and Branded, in addition to Corporate and Other. 
 Presentation of Financial Information 
 The presentation of financial information herein for the periods after our completed divestiture of Rio All-Suite Hotel Casino Rio at the end of the third quarter of 2023 is not fully comparable to the periods prior to such divestiture. 
 This MD A is intended to provide information to assist in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of the factor described in the preceding paragraph and the changing competitive landscape in each of our markets, including changes in market and societal trends, as well as by factors discussed elsewhere herein. We recommend that you read this MD A in conjunction with our unaudited Financial Statements and the notes to those statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Key Performance Metrics 
 Our primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, our retail and online sports betting, as well as our online gaming. Additionally, we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment venues, retail shops, racing and other services to attract customers to our properties. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume and quality of customers staying at, or visiting, our properties and using our sports betting and iGaming applications. 
 Key performance metrics include volume indicators such as drop or handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. The amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. Slot win percentage is typically in the range of approximately 9 to 11 of slot handle for both the Las Vegas and Regional segments. Table games hold percentage is typically in the range of approximately 16 to 23 of table games drop in both the Las Vegas and Regional segments. Sports betting hold is typically in the range of 7 to 11 and iGaming hold typically ranges from 3 to 5 . In addition, hotel occupancy, which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period, is a key indicator for our hotel business in the Las Vegas segment. See Results of Operations section below. Complimentary and discounted rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy. The key metrics we utilize to measure our profitability and performance are Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.

Significant Factors Impacting Financial Results 
 The following summary highlights the significant factors impacting our financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 New Developments During the construction of the permanent facilities for Caesars Virginia and Harrah s Columbus Nebraska, we opened temporary gaming facilities during the second quarter of 2023. Caesars Virginia s temporary facility opened on May 15, 2023, and the permanent facility is scheduled to open in December 2024. Harrah s Columbus Nebraska s temporary facility was open from June 12, 2023, through March 20, 2024, closing in anticipation of the permanent facility which opened on May 17, 2024, following weeks of construction disruption due to weather. 
 Caesars Sportsbook, Caesars Racebook and iGaming mobile apps We continue to launch Caesars Sportsbook and Caesars Racebook in new jurisdictions, as well as our online and mobile iGaming applications. Caesars Palace Online Casino launched in August 2023 and Horseshoe Online Casino has initially launched in October 2024 in Michigan, with plans to expand into other jurisdictions where Caesars Digital iGaming platforms are live. As new states and jurisdictions have legalized sports betting, we have made varying degrees of upfront investments which have been executed through marketing campaigns and promotional incentives to acquire new customers and establish our presence in the new state or jurisdiction. We adjust our level of investment during the launch period in new jurisdictions based, in part, on prior experience and do not expect such investment to continue at elevated levels subsequent to the initial launch periods. 
 Debt Transactions In April 2024, Caesars Virginia, LLC entered into a 425 million Caesars Virginia Delayed Draw Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility and has utilized 210 million of the Caesars Virginia Delayed Draw Term Loan as of September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we refinanced 4.4 billion of debt in both periods. In addition, in May 2024 we amended the CEI Credit Agreement and reduced the interest rate margin on the CEI Term Loan B and in June 2024 we made a voluntary principal repayment of 100 million on the CEI Term Loan B. We recorded l osses on the early extinguishment of debt on the Statements of Operations of 3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 51 million and 200 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we issued 1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00 Senior Notes due 2032 (the CEI Senior Notes due 2032 and utilized the proceeds to redeem approximately 1.1 billion of the CEI Senior Notes due 2027. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for more detail related to 2024 transactions. 
 Economic Factors Impacting Discretionary Spending Gaming and other leisure activities we offer represent discretionary expenditures which may be sensitive to economic downturns which impacts the behavior among the components of our customer mix differently. W e also monitor recent trends, including higher inflation, interest rates, and global hostilities, and the related effects on travel, our customers, and our operations. 
 Impairment Charges Primarily due to localized competition within certain markets in the Regional segment, resulting in decreased projected future cash flows at certain properties, the Company recognized impairments of certain intangible assets during the second quarter of 2024. The Company identified trademarks, gaming rights and goodwill at three reporting units with estimated fair values below their respective carrying values. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized impairment charges totaling 118 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not recognize an impairment.

Consolidated net revenues decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period, due to a decline in casino revenues in our Las Vegas segment primarily driven by the decrease in gaming volume associated with the divestiture of Rio at the end of the third quarter of 2023 and lower table games hold. The Regional segment was negatively impacted by competition associated with new casino resorts opening in some of our regional markets, construction disruption from renovation projects at certain of our properties, and inclement weather in several of our property locations during the first quarter of 2024. These results were partially offset for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by net revenues generated from the opening of our temporary gaming facilities at Caesars Virginia and Harrah s Columbus Nebraska during the second quarter of 2023, followed by the permanent facility of Harrah s Columbus Nebraska in May 2024. Furthermore, net revenues within our Caesars Digital segment improved due to a significant increase in iGaming handle coupled with improved hold and higher hold in sports betting. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses were as follows:

 Casino expenses consist principally of salaries and wages associated with our gaming operations, gaming taxes and marketing and advertising costs attributable to our Caesars Digital segment. Food and beverage expenses consist principally of salaries and wages and costs of goods sold associated with our food and beverage operations. Hotel expenses consist principally of salaries, wages and supplies associated with our hotel operations. Other expenses consist principally of salaries and wages, costs of goods sold associated with our retail operations, entertainment costs, including professional talent fees, and other operations. 
 Casino expenses were flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period, in connection with higher gaming taxes and software costs associated with increased revenues in our Caesars Digital segment, offset in part by lower gaming revenues in our Regional segment. We continue to strategically manage our marketing and advertising spend to reduce our casino expenses related to our Caesars Digital segment. Food and beverage expenses have increased mainly due to higher union and non-union wages in addition to increased employee head count in our Las Vegas segment associated with new food and beverage offerings. We continue to focus on labor efficiencies to manage increased labor costs. 
 General and administrative expenses include items such as information technology, facility maintenance, utilities, property and liability insurance, expenses for administrative departments such as accounting, compliance, purchasing, human resources, legal, internal audit, property taxes and marketing expenses indirectly related to our gaming and non-gaming operations. General and administrative expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year periods, due to lower general advertising expenses and reduced rent expense related to the Rio which was divested at the end of the third quarter of 2023. 
 Corporate expenses include unallocated expenses such as payroll, inclusive of the annual bonus, stock-based compensation, professional fees, and other various expenses not directly related to the Company s operations. 
 Impairment charges were recorded within our Regional segment in June 2024 as a result of a decrease in projected future cash flows at certain properties primarily due to localized competition.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period primarily related to recently completed construction projects. 
 Transaction and other costs, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily includes non-cash losses on the write down and disposal of assets and non-cash changes in equity method investments. Transaction and other costs, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily includes pre-opening costs in connection with new property openings, professional services for integration activities and non-cash changes in equity method investments.

 Interest expense, net increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period primarily due to the annual rent escalator associated with our VICI Leases. Interest expense associated with our debt instruments is also slightly higher due to our debt mix, partially offset by our continuing efforts to reduce outstanding debt. An increase in capitalized interest resulting from ongoing construction projects, including our new developments, has also offset the increase in total interest expense. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, loss on extinguishment of debt was primarily related to the prepayments of the CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2025 and the Caesars Resort Collection CRC Senior Secured Notes and the partial prepayment of the CEI Term Loan B. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, loss on extinguishment of debt was primarily related to the prepayments of the CRC Term Loan, the CRC Incremental Term Loan and the Baltimore Term Loan. 
 Other income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily represents a change in estimate of our disputed claims liability. 
 The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the expected income tax provision based on the federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to an increase in federal and state valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets for excess business interest expense. 
 The income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the expected income tax provision based on the federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to an increase in federal and state valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets for excess business interest expense. The income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the expected income tax benefit based on the federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to the partial release of federal and state valuation allowances.

 (a) Prior year gaming volumes include Rio s table games drop of 20 million and 70 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and slot handle of 98 million and 342 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Our Las Vegas segment s net revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDA decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period. Net revenues, net income and gaming volumes were negatively impacted by the divestiture of Rio at the end of the third quarter of 2023, although the segment s Adjusted EBITDA margin improved due to lower rent expense resulting from the divestiture and improved operating efficiencies. Casino revenues also declined as a result of lower table games hold, which was at the high end and mid-point of our typical range for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, but down compared to the same prior year periods. Entertainment revenues also declined due to the mix of headliner performances in the current year, as compared to prior year. These decreases were slightly offset by higher hotel and food and beverage revenues associated with improved hotel occupancy, higher room rates and new food and beverage offerings. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA in the Las Vegas segment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were also negatively impacted by higher operating costs associated with (a) higher union and non-union wages, (b) increased employee head count associated with new food and beverage offerings and (c) increased promotional costs associated with special events held over the Super Bowl weekend. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, slot win percentage in the Las Vegas segment was within our typical range.

 Our Regional segment s net revenues, net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period, primarily due to the continued impact of competition associated with new casino resorts opening in some of our regional markets and ongoing construction disruption from renovation projects at certain of our properties. Additionally, inclement weather in several of our regional property locations negatively impacted visitor volume in the first quarter of 2024. The impact of these unfavorable factors was partially offset for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by the incremental revenues attributable to our temporary gaming facilities at Caesars Virginia and Harrah s Columbus Nebraska that opened during the second quarter in 2023. The permanent facility of Harrah s Columbus Nebraska opened in May 2024 following the closure of the temporary facility in March 2024. 
 As a result of the aforementioned factors impacting certain of our properties in the Regional segment, we recorded impairments totaling 118 million during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Slot win percentage in the Regional segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was within our typical range.

Promotional and complimentary incentives for poker were 5 million and 4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and 11 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 (b) Caesars Digital generated an additional 191 million and 205 million of sports betting handle for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 669 million and 745 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is not included in this table, for select wholly-owned and third-party operations for which Caesars Digital provides services and we receive all, or a share of, the net profits. Hold related to these operations was 12.7 and 8.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 10.5 and 10.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Sports betting handle includes 10 million and 11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 32 million and 35 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to horse racing and pari-mutuel wagers. 
 Caesars Digital reflects the operations for retail and online sports betting, iGaming, poker, and horse racing, which includes our Caesars Sportsbook, Caesars Racebook and iGaming mobile apps. 
 Caesars Digital s net revenues, net income (loss), Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin improved significantly for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year periods, primarily due to higher iGaming handle and iGaming hold coupled with improved sports betting hold. iGaming handle and iGaming hold improved following the launch of Caesars Palace Online Casino in August 2023. The improved sports betting hold reflects the benefit of the continued investment in our sports betting platform. 
 As sports betting and online casinos expand through increased state or jurisdictional legalization, new product launches, and customer adoption, variations in hold percentages and increases in promotional and marketing expenses in highly competitive markets during promotional periods may negatively impact Caesars Digital s net revenues, net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in comparison to current or prior periods. 
 Sports betting and iGaming hold percentages in the Caesars Digital segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were within our typical range.

 We manage several properties and license rights to the use of certain of our brands. These revenue agreements typically include reimbursement of certain costs that we incur directly. Such costs are primarily related to payroll costs incurred on behalf of the properties under management. The revenue related to these reimbursable management costs has a direct impact on our evaluation of Adjusted EBITDA margin which, when excluded, reflects margins typically realized from such agreements. The table below presents the amount included in net revenues and total operating expenses related to these reimbursable costs. In September 2023, we recorded 25 million of additional other revenue related to the termination of the Caesars Dubai management agreement, which has been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

 Supplemental Unaudited Presentation of Consolidated Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization Adjusted EBITDA for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Adjusted EBITDA (described below), a non-GAAP financial measure, has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry and we believe that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding our ongoing operating results. Management has historically used Adjusted EBITDA when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide a full understanding of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period results. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest income or interest expense net of interest capitalized, (benefit) provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment charges, other (income) loss, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, transaction costs associated with our acquisitions, developments, and divestitures, and non-cash changes in equity method investments. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the expense associated with certain of our leases as these transactions were accounted for as financing obligations and the associated expense is included in interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). Adjusted EBITDA is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net

income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. Uses of cash flows that are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments, and payments under our leases with affiliates of VICI Properties Inc. and GLPI, which can be significant. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. Other companies that provide EBITDA information may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements. 
 The following tables summarizes our Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in addition to reconciling net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA in accordance with GAAP (unaudited):

 (b) Other (income) loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily represents a change in estimate of our disputed claims liability. 
 (c) Impairment charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes impairments within our Regional segment, identified in the second quarter of 2024, as a result of a decrease in projected future cash flows at certain properties primarily due to localized competition. 
 (d) Transaction costs and other, net primarily includes costs related to non-cash losses on the write down and disposal of assets, professional services for transaction and integration costs, various contract exit or termination costs, pre-opening costs in connection with new property openings and expansion projects at existing properties, and non-cash changes in equity method investments. Additionally, transactions costs and other, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes (i) net proceeds received in exchange for participation rights in an insurance claim and (ii) proceeds received for the termination of the Caesars Dubai management agreement. 
 (e) Adjustment for pre-disposition results of operations reflecting the subtraction of results of operations for Rio prior to divestiture at the end of the third quarter of 2023.

The additional financial information is included to enable the comparison of current results with results of prior periods. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We are a holding company, and our only significant assets are ownership interests in our subsidiaries. Our ability to fund our obligations depends on existing cash on hand, cash flows from our subsidiaries and our ability to raise capital. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are existing cash on hand, cash flows from operations, availability of borrowings under our CEI Revolving Credit Facility and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities. Our cash requirements may fluctuate significantly depending on our decisions with respect to business acquisitions or divestitures and strategic capital and marketing investments.

As of September 30, 2024, our cash on hand and borrowing capacity was as follows: 
 (In millions) September 30, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents 802 Revolver capacity (a) 
 2,035 Revolver capacity committed to letters of credit (84) Revolver capacity committed as regulatory requirement (46) Total (b)

 ____________________ 
 (a) Revolver capacity includes 2.05 billion under the CEI Revolving Credit Facility, maturing in January 2028 (subject to a springing maturity in the event certain other long-term debt of Caesars is not extended or repaid), and 25 million under the CVA Revolving Credit Facility, maturing on April 26, 2029, less 40 million reserved for specific purposes. 
 (b) Excludes approximately 190 million of additional borrowing available under the CVA Delayed Draw Term Loan. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating activities generated operating cash inflows of 766 million, as compared to operating cash inflows of 1.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to changes in working capital, coupled with the results of operations described above. 
 On February 6, 2024, we entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement No. 3 pursuant to which we incurred a new senior secured incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of 2.9 billion (the CEI Term Loan B-1 under the CEI Credit Agreement. The CEI Term Loan B-1 requires quarterly principal payments in amounts equal to 0.25 of the original aggregate principal amount of the CEI Term Loan B-1, with the balance payable at maturity. Borrowings under the CEI Term Loan B-1 bear interest, paid at least quarterly, at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a forward-looking term rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate Term SOFR ), subject to a floor of 0.50 or (b) a base rate (the Base Rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the Prime Rate in the United States, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 per annum and (iii) the one-month Term SOFR plus 1.00 per annum, in each case, plus an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is 2.75 per annum in the case of any Term SOFR loan and 1.75 per annum in the case of any Base Rate loan. The CEI Term Loan B-1 was issued at a price of 99.75 of the principal amount and will mature on February 6, 2031. 
 Additionally, on February 6, 2024, we issued 1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 6.50 senior secured notes due 2032 (the CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2032 pursuant to an indenture by and among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee, and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent. The CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2032 rank equally with all existing and future first-priority lien obligations of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors. The CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2032 will mature on February 15, 2032, with interest payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2024. 
 The net proceeds from the CEI Term Loan B-1 and the net proceeds from the issuance of the CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2032, together with borrowings under the CEI Revolving Credit Facility, were used to tender, redeem, repurchase, defease, and/or satisfy and discharge any and all of the principal amounts, including accrued and unpaid interest, related expenses and fees of both the 5.75 Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the CRC Senior Secured Notes and the 6.25 Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2025 ). As a result of these transactions, we recognized 48 million of loss on early extinguishment of debt. 
 On May 9, 2024, we entered into a fourth amendment to the CEI Credit Agreement which, among other things, reduces the interest rate margin applicable to the Company s existing CEI Term Loan B to 2.75 per annum in the case of any Term SOFR loan and 1.75 per annum in the case of any Base Rate loan. Prior to the fourth amendment, the applicable margin was 3.25 per annum in the case of any Term SOFR loan (plus a Term SOFR adjustment of 0.10 and 2.25 per annum in the case of any Base Rate loan, subject to one 0.25 step-down based on our net total leverage ratio. On June 28, 2024, we made a voluntary repayment of 100 million in aggregate principal amount of the CEI Term Loan B with cash on hand. 
 On April 26, 2024, Caesars Virginia, LLC entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and certain banks and other financial institutions and lenders party thereto (the CVA Credit Agreement ), which provides for a senior secured first lien multi-draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 400 million (the CVA Delayed Draw Term Loan and a senior secured first lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 25 million (the CVA Revolving Credit Facility ), both maturing on April 26, 2029. The CVA Delayed Draw Term Loan requires quarterly principal payments commencing on the last day of the first full fiscal quarter following the opening date of the permanent facility of Caesars Virginia. The CVA Revolving Credit Facility and the CVA Delayed Draw Term Loan are subject to a variable rate of interest based on Term SOFR plus an applicable margin. As of September 30, 2024, there was 210 million utilized under the CVA Delayed Draw Term Loan.

On October 17, 2024, we issued 1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of the CEI Senior Notes due 2032. The net proceeds from the issuance of the CEI Senior Notes due 2032 were used to redeem approximately 1.1 billion of the principal amount, including accrued and unpaid interest, related expenses and fees of the CEI Senior Notes due 2027. As a result of the early repayment, we estimate to incur approximately 31 million of loss on extinguishment of debt during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 On November 8, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a 150 million common stock repurchase program (the 2018 Share Repurchase Program ). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired 3,872,478 shares of common stock under the 2018 Share Repurchase Program at an aggregate value of 141 million, excluding any applicable excise taxes, and an average of 36.38 per share. In connection with these repurchases, including repurchases of 9 million in 2018, the 2018 Share Repurchase Program was completed and all shares repurchased under the 2018 Share Repurchase Program were retired. No shares were repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In September 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a 500 million common stock repurchase program (the 2024 Share Repurchase Program ). See Share Repurchase Program below for details. 
 We expect that our primary capital requirements going forward will relate to the expansion and maintenance of our properties, taxes, servicing our outstanding indebtedness, and rent payments under the GLPI Leases and the VICI Leases. We make capital expenditures and perform continuing refurbishment and maintenance at our properties to maintain our quality standards. Our capital expenditure requirements for the remainder of 2024 include the completion of expansion projects, hotel renovations and continued investment into new markets with our Caesars Sportsbook and iGaming applications. In addition, we may, from time to time, seek to repurchase or prepay our outstanding indebtedness. Any such purchases or prepayments may be funded by existing cash balances or the incurrence of debt. The amount and timing of any repurchase will be based on business and market conditions, capital availability, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. 
 We have agreements with certain professional sports leagues and teams, sporting event facilities and media companies for tickets, suites, advertising, marketing, promotional and sponsorship opportunities including communication with partner customer databases. Some of the agreements provide us with exclusivity to access the aforementioned rights within the casino and/or sports betting category. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , obligations related to these agreements were 455 million and 605 million, respectively, with contracts extending through 2040. These obligations include various third-party agreements which have been entered into by us for certain of our Las Vegas and Regional properties, or our Caesars Digital segment. The agreements include leasing of event suites that are generally considered short-term leases for which we do not record a right of use asset or lease liability. We recognize expenses in the period services are received in accordance with the various agreements. In addition, assets or liabilities may be recorded related to the timing of payments as required by the respective agreement. 
 We partnered with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians to build and develop Caesars Virginia. The permanent development has a budget of 750 million and will include a premier destination resort casino with a 320-room hotel, 1,300 slot machines, 85 live table games, a WSOP Poker Room, a Caesars Sportsbook, a live entertainment theater and 40,000 square feet of meeting and convention space. Caesars Virginia s temporary facility opened on May 15, 2023 and the permanent facility is scheduled to open in December 2024. Construction of Caesars Virginia s permanent facility is being funded in part by cash flows from the temporary facility as well as funds available under the CVA Credit Agreement . 
 Additionally, on May 17, 2024, we opened the permanent facility of Harrah s Columbus Nebraska which is a casino featuring a new one-mile horse racing surface, a 40,000-square-foot-casino and sportsbook with more than 400 slot machines and 20 table games, as well as a restaurant and retail space. 
 As a condition of the extension of the casino operating contract and ground lease for Caesars New Orleans, formerly Harrah s New Orleans, we were also required to make a capital investment of at least 325 million on or around Caesars New Orleans. The capital investment involves the rebranding of the property to Caesars New Orleans which includes a renovation and full interior and exterior redesign, updated casino floor, new culinary experiences and a new 340-room hotel tower. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has met the capital investment requirements, and the project is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Cash used for capital expenditures totaled 1.0 billion and 895 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, related to our growth, renovation, maintenance, and other capital projects. The following table summarizes our capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and an estimated range of capital expenditures for the remainder of 2024. Excluding capital expenditure relating to Caesars Virginia, we estimate 2024 cash capital expenditure spend of approximately 850 million.

 (a) On April 26, 2024, Caesars Virginia, LLC entered into a new five-year 425 million pro rata bank financing to fund the remaining capital expenditures associated with the permanent casino resort facility, which is expected to open in December 2024. 
 A significant portion of our liquidity needs are for debt service and payments associated with our leases. Our estimated debt service (including principal and interest) is approximately 175 million for the remainder of 2024. We also lease certain real property assets from third parties, including VICI and GLPI. The VICI Leases are subject to annual escalations, that take effect in November of each year, based on the Consumer Price Index CPI ). In addition to the CPI escalator, November 2024 represents the beginning of the first lease year in which our VICI leases are also subject to a variable rent component based on certain historical net revenues of our leased properties. The next such lease year with a variable rent adjustment begins November 2027. We estimate our lease payments to VICI and GLPI to be approximately 331 million for the remainder of 2024. 
 We have periodically divested assets to raise capital or, in previous cases, to comply with conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions imposed by antitrust, gaming and other regulatory entities. If an agreed upon selling price for future divestitures does not exceed the carrying value of the assets, we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods which may be material. 
 On August 1, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the World Series of Poker WSOP assets to NSUS Group Inc NSUS ). Under the terms of the agreement, NSUS will pay 250 million in cash at closing and enter into a term loan with us for an additional 250 million for a total purchase price of 500 million. The term loan will bear interest at a market rate, plus an applicable margin, with interest and principal payments due quarterly through the fifth anniversary of the closing date. On October 29, 2024, we closed the sale to NSUS. 
 Concurrent with signing the sale agreement, we entered into licensing agreements with NSUS that allows us to continue our current operations within the United States, including the WSOP s live tournament series in Las Vegas for the next 20 years. 
 We are also continuing to negotiate the sale of certain non-core assets. 
 We expect that our current liquidity, including availability of borrowings under our committed credit facility and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital requirements and service our outstanding indebtedness for the next twelve months. 
 Debt and Master Lease Covenant Compliance 
 The CEI Revolving Credit Facility, the CEI Term Loan A, the CEI Term Loan B, the CEI Term Loan B-1 and the indentures governing the CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2030, the CEI Senior Secured Notes due 2032, the CEI Senior Notes due 2027, and the CEI Senior Notes due 2029 contain covenants which are standard and customary for these types of agreements. These include negative covenants, which, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, limit our ability to (among other items) incur additional indebtedness, make investments, make restricted payments, including dividends, grant liens, sell assets and make acquisitions. 
 Table of Contents 
 43 

The CEI Revolving Credit Facility and the CEI Term Loan A include a maximum net total leverage ratio financial covenant of 7.25:1 until December 31, 2024 and 6.50:1 from and after December 31, 2024. In addition, the CEI Revolving Credit Facility and the CEI Term Loan A include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant of 1.75:1 until December 31, 2024 and 2.0:1 from and after December 31, 2024. From and after the repayment of the CEI Term Loan A, the financial covenants applicable to the CEI Revolving Credit Facility will be tested solely to the extent that certain testing conditions are satisfied. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in an acceleration of the maturity of indebtedness outstanding under the relevant debt document. 
 The GLPI Leases and VICI Leases contain certain covenants requiring minimum capital expenditures based on a percentage of net revenues along with maintaining certain financial ratios. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the applicable financial covenants described above. 
 The CVA Revolving Credit Facility and the CVA Delayed Draw Term Loan contain covenants which are standard and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum net total leverage ratio financial covenant of 4:1 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant of 1.05:1. Caesars Virginia LLC s compliance requirements commence after the first full quarter following the opening of the permanent facility of Caesars Virginia. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 Subsequent to the completion of the 2018 Share Repurchase Program in September 2024, as described above, on October 2, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a 500 million common stock repurchase program in September 2024. Under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of common stock on the open market (either with or without a 10b5-1 plan) or through privately negotiated transactions. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. There is no minimum number of shares of common stock that we are required to repurchase under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program. All share repurchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program will be retired. As of September 30, 2024, there were no share repurchases made under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no other material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to our contractual obligations as disclosed in Part II, Item 7 of the 2023 Annual Report. See Note 5 to our unaudited Financial Statements, which is included elsewhere in this report, for additional information regarding contractual obligations. 
 
 Other Liquidity Matters 
 We are faced with certain contingencies, from time to time, involving litigation, claims, assessments, environmental remediation or compliance. These commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail, when applicable, in Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings and Note 5 to our unaudited Financial Statements, both of which are included elsewhere in this report. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business which is included elsewhere in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our critical accounting policies disclosures are included in the 2023 Annual Report. There have been no material changes since December 31, 2023. We have not substantively changed the application of our policies, and there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques used as compared to those described in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from variable rate long-term debt arrangements. We manage our interest rate risk by monitoring interest rates, including future projected rates, and adjust our mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings. 
 Table of Contents 
 44 

As of September 30, 2024, long-term variable-rate borrowings totaled 6.3 billion under the CEI Term Loans, the CVA Delayed Draw Term Loan and the CEI Revolving Credit Facility and no amounts were outstanding under the CVA Revolving Credit Facility. Long-term variable-rate borrowings under the CEI Term Loans, the CVA Delayed Draw Term Loan and the CEI Revolving Credit Facility represented approximately 50 of consolidated long-term debt as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rates on our variable and fixed rate debt were 7.87 and 6.70 , respectively. 
 All of the variable rate debt instruments are subject to Term SOFR interest rates plus a reasonable margin. 
 We evaluate our exposure to market risk by monitoring interest rates in the marketplace and have, on occasion, utilized derivative financial instruments to help manage this risk. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. There have been no other material quantitative changes in our market risk exposure, or how such risks are managed from the information previously reported under Part II, Item 7A of the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls
