 million tons. 
 In September 2020, the Company acquired frac sand mines and related processing facilities in Ottawa, Illinois and New Auburn, Wisconsin. The annual processing capacity at the Ottawa, Illinois facility is approximately million tons and it has access to the Class I Burlington Northern Santa Fe railway through the Company s nearby Peru, Illinois transload facility. The Company began operating the Ottawa, Illinois mine and Peru, Illinois transload facility in October 2020. The Company currently has no plans to operate the New Auburn facility for the foreseeable future. 
 In March 2022, the Company acquired a frac sand mine and processing facility in Blair, Wisconsin. The annual processing capacity at the Blair facility is approximately million tons and contains an onsite, unit train capable rail terminal with access to the Class 1 Canadian National Railway. The Company commenced operations at the Blair facility in April 2023. 
 Transload Logistics Solutions 
 The Company also offers proppant logistics solutions to its customers through, among other things, its network of in-basin transloading terminals and its SmartSystems TM wellsite proppant storage and management capabilities. The Company has direct access to four Class I rail lines and the ability to access all Class 1 rail lines within the United States and Canada. The Company s network of terminals and rail line access enables it to provide cost-effective delivery options to its customers. 
 The Company has several in-basin rail terminals. The Company acquired rights in March 2018 to operate a unit train capable transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota to service the Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin. In 2020, the Company, as part of its acquisition of the Ottawa, Illinois facility, obtained rights to use a rail terminal located in El Reno, Oklahoma. In September 2021, the Company acquired the rights to construct and operate a transloading terminal in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania to service the Appalachian Basin, including the Marcellus and Utica Formations, which became operational in January 2022 and was further expanded in the fourth quarter of 2023. In December 2023 and January 2024, the Company acquired rights to use transloading terminals in Minerva, Ohio and Dennison, Ohio, respectively, which service the Appalachian Basin. The Minerva terminal became operational in the second quarter of 2024 and the Dennison terminal became operational in the third quarter of 2024. 
 The Company s SmartSystems offer proppant storage solutions that create efficiencies, flexibility, enhanced safety and reliability for customers by providing the capability to unload, store and deliver proppant at the wellsite, as well as having the ability to rapidly set up, takedown and transport the entire system. The SmartDepot TM silo includes passive and active dust suppression technology, along with the capability of gravity-fed operation. The SmartPath transloader is a mobile sand transloading system designed to work with bottom dump trailers and features a drive over conveyor, surge bin, and dust collection system. The Company has developed the Smartbelt TM a belt system to pair with its SmartPath, which allows for feeding sand directly into the hopper at the wellsite. Rapid deployment trailers are designed for quick setup, takedown and transportation of the entire SmartSystem, and they detach from the wellsite equipment, which allows for removal from the wellsite during operation. A proprietary software program, the SmartSystem Tracker TM , allows customers to monitor silo-specific information, including location, proppant type and proppant inventory.

 Overview 
 
 The Company 
 We are a fully integrated frac and industrial sand supply and services company. We offer complete mine to wellsite proppant supply and logistics solutions to our frac sand customers. We produce low-cost, high quality Northern White sand, which is a premium sand used as proppant to enhance hydrocarbon recovery rates in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and for a variety of industrial applications. We also offer proppant logistics solutions to our customers through our in-basin transloading terminals and our SmartSystems wellsite storage capabilities. In recent years, we have expanded our product line to offer Industrial Products Solutions IPS in order to diversify our customer base and markets we serve by offering sand for industrial uses. We market our products and services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, oilfield service companies, and industrial manufacturers. We sell our sand through long-term contracts, short-term supply agreements or spot sales in the open market. We provide wellsite proppant storage solutions services and equipment under flexible contract terms custom tailored to meet the needs of our customers. We believe that, among other things: (i) the size and favorable geologic characteristics of our sand reserves; (ii) the strategic location and logistical advantages of our facilities; (iii) our proprietary SmartDepot portable wellsite storage silos, SmartPath transloader and SmartBelt conveyor;

 (iv) access to all Class I rail lines; and (v) the industry experience of our senior management team make us as a highly attractive provider of sand and logistics services. 
 We incorporated in Delaware in July 2011 and began operations at our Oakdale, Wisconsin facility with 1.1 million tons of annual processing capacity in July 2012. After several expansions, our current annual processing capacity at our Oakdale facility, which has access to both the Canadian Pacific and Union Pacific rail networks, is approximately 5.5 million tons. In 2020, we acquired our Ottawa , Illinois mine and processing facility, which has an annual processing capacity of approximately 1.6 million tons and access to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe rail network. In March 2022, we acquired our Blair, Wisconsin facility, which has approximately 2.9 million tons of total annual processing capacity and contains an onsite, unit train capable rail terminal with access to the Class 1 Canadian National rail network. We commenced operations at the Blair facility in the second quarter of 2023. Our total annual processing capacity of our operating facilities is approximately 10.0 million tons. 
 We directly control five in-basin transloading facilities and have access to third party transloading terminals in all operating basins. We operate a unit train capable transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota to service the Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin. We also serve the Appalachian Basin through three company-controlled terminals. In January 2022, we began operations at a unit train capable transloading terminal in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, which we expanded in 2023. In December 2023, we acquired the right to operate a terminal in Minerva, Ohio and in January 2024, we acquired the right to operate a terminal in Dennison, Ohio. The Minerva terminal became operational in the second quarter of 2024 and the Dennison terminal became operational in the third quarter of 2024. We also have the right to use a rail terminal located in El Reno, Oklahoma. These terminals allow us to offer more efficient and sustainable delivery options to our customers. Additionally, we have longstanding relationships with third party terminal operators that provide us with access to all oil and natural gas exploration production basins of North America. 
 We offer to our customers portable wellsite proppant storage and management solutions through our SmartSystems products and services. Our SmartSystems provide our customers with the capability to unload, store and deliver proppant at the wellsite, as well as the ability to rapidly set up, takedown and transport the entire system. This capability creates efficiencies, flexibility, enhanced safety and reliability for customers. Through our SmartSystems wellsite proppant storage solutions, we offer the SmartDepot and SmartDepotXL silo systems, SmartPath transloader, SmartBelt conveyor, and our rapid deployment trailers. Our SmartDepot silos include passive and active dust suppression technology, along with the capability of a gravity-fed operation. Our SmartPath transloader is designed to work with bottom dump trailers and features a drive over conveyor, surge bin, and dust collection system. Our SmartBelt conveyor is designed to work with our SmartPath transloader to directly feed sand into the blender. Our rapid deployment trailers are designed for quick setup, takedown and transportation of the entire SmartSystem, which allows for efficient removal from the wellsite during operation. We believe the system has the ability to keep up with any hydraulic fracturing operation. We have also developed a proprietary software program, the SmartSystem Tracker , which allows our SmartSystems customers to monitor silo-specific information, including location, proppant type and proppant inventory. We believe that our SmartSystems reduce trucking and related fuel consumption for our customers, helping them reduce their carbon footprint in their daily operations. 
 We have expanded our product line to offer industrial sand through IPS. In 2023, we completed the installation of blending and cooling assets at our Ottawa, Illinois facility that we believe will provide new opportunities to increase our customer base in the IPS business. While sales of IPS to customers were a small portion of our overall sand sales in 2022 and 2023, going forward, we expect to continue to expand and diversify to serve the major industrial markets throughout North America, including glass, foundry, building products, filtration, geothermal, renewables, ceramics, turf landscape, retail, recreation and more. 
 
 Market Trends 
 Our historical results of operations and cash flows may not be indicative of results of operations and cash flows to be expected in the future. 
 During 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024, supply and demand for Northern White Sand has been in relative balance. We saw an increase in the volume of sand sold in the first half of 2023 followed by a slowdown in activity later in the year due to customers having frontloaded their budgeted spending earlier in the year. Activity also improved in the first half of 2024 as customers ramped up activity based on 2024 budget plans followed by a decline in the third quarter of 2024. Pricing for

sand has trended downward since the second half of 2023 due to stabilized supply and demand. High levels of inflation led to increasing operating expenses in 2023, which have continued at increased levels through the third quarter of 2024. Softening economic activities in certain countries, the continuation of the war in Ukraine, the conflicts in the Middle East, along with President Biden s pause on liquified natural gas export permits could impact oil and natural gas prices and overall oil and gas activity thereby leading to substantial volatility in demand and pricing in the future. The continued volatility in oil and natural gas demand and the current availability of sufficient supply of sand has led to continued reluctance by some customers to enter into long-term contracts. As such, some customers have instead trended toward purchasing their frac sand supply in the spot market or under short term supply agreements at current market prices. We cannot predict macroeconomic events or if pricing trends for our products will continue, increase, decrease or stabilize. 
 Supplies of high-quality Northern White frac sand are limited to select areas, predominantly in western Wisconsin and limited areas of Minnesota and Illinois. We believe the ability to obtain large contiguous reserves in these areas is a key constraint and can be an important supply consideration when assessing the economic viability of a potential frac sand processing facility. Further constraining the supply and throughput of Northern White frac sand is that not all of the large reserve mines have on-site excavation, processing or logistics capabilities, which impact the long-term competitiveness of these mines due to lower efficiency and higher cost structures. Historically, much of the capital investment in Northern White frac sand mines was used for the development of coarser deposits in western Wisconsin, which is inconsistent with the increasing demand for finer mesh frac sand in recent years. As such, competitors in the Northern White frac sand market have shuttered or idled operations at certain facilities due to the higher demand for finer sands and due to lower cost regional sand sources that have eroded the ongoing economic viability of mines with coarser reserve deposits and inefficient mining and logistics facilities. 
 Demand in the IPS business is relatively stable as customers are spread over a wide range of industries including glass, foundry, building products, filtration, geothermal, renewables, ceramics, turf landscape, retail, recreation and more. The IPS business is primarily influenced by macroeconomic drivers such as consumer demand and population growth. We believe that as this business grows, it will provide us with the ability to diversify our sales into more stable, consumer-driven products to help mitigate price volatility in the oil and gas industry.

 Revenues 
 Revenues were 63.2 million and tons sold were approximately 1,189,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were 76.9 million, during which time we sold approximately 1,219,000 tons of sand. The key factors contributing to the revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 being lower, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 were as follows: 
 Sand revenue was 17 lower at 62.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 74.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The lower sand revenue was due to lower sand volumes sold along with lower average sand prices.

SMART SAND, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 (UNAUDITED) 

SmartSystems revenue was approximately 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in SmartSystems revenue was due to lower utilization of our SmartSystems fleet. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold was 56.7 million and 62.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to reduced costs of production on lower volumes sold and cost initiatives to reduce labor and maintenance expenses. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit was 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in profitability for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the combination of lower sales volumes and lower average sales prices on our products. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to 1.3 million in banking and legal fees associated with refinancing our ABL facility. Additionally, in September 2024, we closed our Saskatoon, Canada manufacturing facility and relocated it to the United States. We recorded a net loss of 1.1 million on the disposal of fixed assets related to this facility. 
 Interest Expense, net 
 We incurred 0.3 million and 0.3 million of net interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our effective tax rate was approximately 98.1 and (38.8) , respectively. To estimate the interim period income tax expense (benefit), the company calculates the estimated effective tax rate for the full year and applies that rate to the net income for the period. The computation of the effective tax rate includes modifications from the statutory rate such as income tax credits, tax depletion deduction, carrybacks, and state apportionment changes, among other items that are specific to our Company. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions included in our balance sheet, related to our depletion deduction methodology. As of September 30, 2024, we determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to fully realize the benefits of certain existing deductible temporary differences and have recorded a partial valuation allowance against the gross deferred tax assets, which is included in liabilities, long-term, net on our balance sheet, and a corresponding increase to the income tax expense on our condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 Net (Loss) Income 
 Net loss was (0.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net income of 6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit was negatively affected in the current period by the decline in sales and as well as increased operating expenses due to the ABL refinancing and closure of the Saskatoon facility.

 Revenues 
 Revenues were 220.0 million and tons sold were approximately 3,799,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 234.0 million, during which time we sold approximately 3,498,000 tons of sand. The key factors contributing to the change in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were as follows: 
 Sand revenue declined to 213.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 227.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total volumes increased by approximately 9 , however, average sand prices were lower in 2024 as supply and demand shifts have become more in balance compared to the same period in 2023. We also recognized higher contractual shortfall revenue in the prior year. 
 SmartSystems revenue, was approximately 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in SmartSystems revenue was due to slightly higher utilization our SmartSystems fleet in early 2024.

 (UNAUDITED) 

Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold was 188.6 million and 195.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Cost of goods sold remained relatively flat with reduced freight on a per ton basis due to a shift in delivery location and more tons sold at the minegate, partially offset by higher total cost of production due to higher volumes sold. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit was 31.4 million and 38.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to lower average sales prices of our sand relative to the cost to produce and deliver products to our customers. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were consistent in total at 28.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 28.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost reduction efforts in most SG A accounts were largely offset by higher royalties on larger sales volumes and bank and legal fees associated with the refinancing of our Former ABL Credit Facility. Additionally, in September 2024, we closed our Saskatoon manufacturing facility and disposed of fixed assets there and recorded a net loss on the disposal of 1.1 million, compared to a 1.9 million net loss on disposal of fixed assets in 2023 as we reconfigured one of our wet plants to increase the efficiency of its operations and upgraded some of our mining equipment. 
 Interest Expense, net 
 We incurred 1.2 million and 0.9 million of net interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, our effective tax rate was approximately 74.7 and (60.8) , respectively. To estimate the interim period income tax expense (benefit), the company calculates the estimated effective tax rate for the full year and applies that rate to the net income for the period. The computation of the effective tax rate includes modifications from the statutory rate such as income tax credits, tax depletion deduction, carrybacks, and state apportionment changes, among other items that are specific to our Company. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions included on our balance sheet, related to our depletion deduction methodology.

 Net Loss 
 Net loss was 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net income of 9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit was negatively affected in the current period by the decline in sales. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Contribution margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Gross profit is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to contribution margin, net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and adjusted

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 (UNAUDITED) 

EBITDA and net cash provided by operating activities is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider contribution margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA or free cash flow in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because contribution margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. 
 
 Contribution Margin 
 We use contribution margin, which we define as total revenues less cost of goods sold excluding depreciation, depletion and accretion of asset retirement obligations, to measure our financial and operating performance. Contribution margin excludes other operating expenses and income, including costs not directly associated with the operations of our business such as accounting, human resources, information technology, legal, sales and other administrative activities. 
 We believe that reporting contribution margin and contribution margin per ton sold provides useful performance metrics to management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, because these metrics provide an operating and financial measure of our ability, as a combined business, to generate margin in excess of our operating cost base. 
 Gross profit is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to contribution margin. Contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to gross profit presented in accordance with GAAP. Since contribution margin may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of contribution margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of gross profit to contribution margin. Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands, except per ton amounts) Revenue 63,158 76,900 220,009 234,026 Cost of goods sold 56,671 62,502 188,638 195,302 Gross profit 6,487 14,398 31,371 38,724 Depreciation, depletion, and accretion of asset retirement obligations 6,700 6,573 20,111 19,088 Contribution margin 13,187 20,971 51,482 57,812 Contribution margin per ton 11.09 17.20 13.55 16.53 Total tons sold 1,189 1,219 3,799 3,498 
 Contribution margin was 13.2 million and 21.0 million, or 11.09 and 17.20 per ton sold, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Contribution margin was 51.5 million and 57.8 million, or 13.55 and 16.53 per ton sold, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decline in overall contribution margin for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to lower average selling price of our sand, partially mitigated by cost reduction measures throughout the Company. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define EBITDA as net income, plus: (i) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense; (ii) income tax expense (benefit) and other results of operations based taxes; and (iii) interest expense. We define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus: (i) gain or loss on sale of fixed assets or discontinued operations; (ii) integration and transition costs associated with specified transactions; (iii) equity compensation; (iv) acquisition and development costs; (v) non-recurring cash charges related to restructuring, retention and other similar actions; (vi) earn-out, contingent consideration obligations; and (vii) non-cash charges

and unusual or non-recurring charges. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess: 
 the financial performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis of our assets; 
 the viability of capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; 
 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; 
 our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in our industry without regard to the impact of financing methods or capital structure; and 
 our debt covenant compliance, as adjusted EBITDA is a key component of critical covenants to the ABL Credit Facility. 
 We believe that our presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income presented in accordance with GAAP. Because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net (loss) income (98) 6,727 (744) 9,435 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 7,161 6,985 21,574 20,285 Income tax expense and other taxes (5,136) (1,879) (2,199) (3,569) Interest expense 383 304 1,286 1,203 EBITDA 2,310 12,137 19,917 27,354 Net loss on disposal of fixed assets 1,063 (92) 1,069 1,821 Equity compensation 765 850 2,072 2,388 Acquisition and development costs 8 70 316 341 Loss on extinguishment of debt 31 1,341 Cash charges related to restructuring and retention of employees 148 18 Bank and legal costs related to financing not closed 1,294 1,294 Accretion of asset retirement obligations 249 235 747 670 Adjusted EBITDA 5,720 13,200 26,904 32,592 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 13.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The lower Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to the combination of lower sales volumes and lower average sales prices of our sand. Adjusted EBITDA was 26.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 32.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to lower average sales prices of our sand.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 (UNAUDITED) 

Free Cash Flow 
 Free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to measure the liquidity of our business. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flows. Free cash flows should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with GAAP. Because free cash flows may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of free cash flows may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flows. Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands, except per ton amounts) Net cash provided by operating activities 5,810 12,477 16,829 33,650 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (2,135) (6,881) (5,135) (16,126) Free cash flow 3,675 5,596 11,694 17,524 
 Free cash flow was 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Free cash flow was 11.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The positive free cash flow for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to management s focus on reducing operating expenses and focus on lower capital expenditures. The decline in average selling prices in 2024 has negatively affected free cash flow. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 In September 2024 we refinanced our former 20.0 million ABL facility to a new 30.0 million FCB ABL facility. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow generated from operations and availability under our FCB ABL Credit Facility and other equipment financing sources. As of September 30, 2024, cash on hand was 7.2 million and we had 30.0 million in undrawn availability on our FCB ABL Credit Facility. 
 Based on our balance sheet, cash flows, current market conditions, and information available to us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and other available capital resources, to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Dividends and Share Repurchase Program 
 On October 3, 2024, the Smart Sand Board of Directors declared a special dividend of 0.10 per share of common stock, which was paid on October 28, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 15, 2024. The initial dividend payment was approximately 3.9 million. 
 On October 3, 2024, the Smart Sand Board of Directors also approved an eighteen-month share repurchase program under which we may purchase up to 10.0 million of our ordinary shares (the Repurchase Program ). Pursuant to the Repurchase Program, we may repurchase our ordinary shares from time to time, in amounts, at prices and at such times as management deems appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. Management may make repurchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated repurchase programs or structured share repurchase programs. The Repurchase Program will be conducted in compliance with applicable legal requirements and shall be subject to market conditions and other factors. The Repurchase Program does not obligate management to acquire any particular amount of ordinary shares and the Repurchase Program may be modified or suspended at any time.

SMART SAND, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 (UNAUDITED) 

 Capital Requirements 
 We expect full year 2024 capital expenditures to be between 8.0 million and 10.0 million. Our expected capital expenditures for 2024 are primarily for process improvement and efficiency projects at our mine sites, upgrading mining equipment and the build out of our new Ohio terminals. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with cash from operations, equipment financing options available to us or borrowings under the FCB ABL Credit Facility. 
 Indebtedness 
 Our debt facilities include the VFI Equipment Financing, various notes payable and our FCB ABL Credit Facility. Our VFI Equipment Financing is secured by a substantial portion of the Company s SmartSystems equipment. The outstanding balance under the VFI Equipment Financing as of September 30, 2024 was 9.2 million. Minimum cash payments on this facility for the remainder of 2024 are anticipated to be 0.7 million. Our various notes payable are primarily secured by heavy equipment. Total debt under these notes payable as of September 30, 2024 was 3.8 million. Minimum cash payments on these notes payable for the remainder of 2024 are anticipated to be 0.3 million. There were no outstanding borrowings on our FCB ABL Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 Operating Leases 
 We use leases primarily to procure certain office space, railcars and heavy equipment as part of our operations. The majority of our lease payments are fixed and determinable. Our operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 were 23.5 million. Minimum cash payments on operating leases for the remainder of 2024 are anticipated to be 2.6 million. 
 Mineral Rights Propert y 
 The Company is obligated under certain contracts for minimum payments for the right to use land for extractive activities. The annual minimum payments under these contracts are approximately 2.5 million per year in the aggregate for the next 13 years. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We had outstanding performance bonds of 19.7 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had contractual obligations for the FCB ABL Credit Facility, VFI Equipment Financing, notes payable, operating and finance leases, delivery of sand, royalties and similar minimum payments for the rights to mine land, capital expenditures, asset retirement obligations, and other commitments to municipalities for maintenance. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, environmental contamination and reclamation and the protection of the environment and natural resources. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. 
 
 Seasonality 
 Our business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations in weather that impact the production levels for a portion of our wet sand processing capacity. While our dry plants are able to process finished product volumes evenly throughout the year, some of our excavation and our wet sand processing activities have historically been limited during winter months. As a consequence, we typically have experienced lower cash operating costs in the first and fourth quarter of each calendar year, and higher cash operating costs in the second and third quarter of each calendar year when we have overproduced sand to meet demand in the winter months. These higher cash operating costs are capitalized into inventory and expensed when these tons

SMART SAND, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 (UNAUDITED) 

are sold, which can lead to us having higher overall cost of production in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year as we expense inventory costs that were previously capitalized. We have indoor wet processing facilities at two of our plant locations, which allow us to produce wet sand inventory year-round to support a portion of our dry sand processing capacity, which may reduce some of the effects of this seasonality. We may also sell frac sand for use in oil and natural gas producing basins where severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities and, as a result, our sales volumes to those areas may be reduced during such severe weather periods. 
 
 Customer Concentration 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, EQT Corporation, Encino Energy and Liberty Oilfield Services accounted for 53.9 of total revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenue from EQT Corporation and Liberty Oilfield Services accounted for 27.6 , and 12.9 respectively, of total revenue. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and procedures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of interim statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates used in the preparation of these financial statements include but are not limited to: impairment considerations of assets, including intangible assets, fixed assets, and inventory; estimated cost of future asset retirement obligations; fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities; recoverability of deferred tax assets; inventory reserve; and the collectability of receivables; and certain liabilities. 
 Actual results could differ from management s best estimates as additional information or actual results become available in the future, and those differences could be material. Future economic performance is uncertain due to current high inflation and other economic concerns. We continue to actively monitor the global impact of current events, but we are unable to estimate the impact of future events on our financial position and results of operations or give any assurances that these events will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The majority of our debt is financed under fixed interest rates. Borrowings under the FCB ABL Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate SOFR plus a margin of 2.75 . There were no outstanding borrowings under our FCB ABL Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. We do not believe this represents a material interest rate risk. 
 We have considered other changes in our exposure to market risks during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and have determined that there have been no additional material changes to our exposure to market risks from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Effective July 1, 2024, the Company upgraded its enterprise management and accounting system. Management has maintained its control environment during this transition through risk evaluation, monitoring, communication and separation of duties. Detective and preventative controls have been maintained or enhanced in the new system. We will continue to evaluate whether there are changes that materially affect or are reasonably likely to have materially affected, our internal control over financial reporting.

Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no shares were sold by the Company without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 
 On October 3, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an eighteen-month share repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to 10.0 million of its ordinary shares (the Repurchase Program ). Pursuant to the Repurchase Program, the Company may repurchase its ordinary shares from time to time, in amounts, at prices and at such times as it deems appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. The Company may make repurchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated repurchase programs or structured share repurchase programs. The Repurchase Program will be conducted in compliance with applicable legal requirements and shall be subject to market conditions and other factors. The Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of ordinary shares and the Repurchase Program may be modified or suspended at any time at the Company s discretion. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 
 None. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 We are committed to maintaining a culture that prioritizes mine safety. We believe that our commitment to safety, the environment and the communities in which we operate is critical to the success of our business. Our sand mining operations are subject to mining safety regulation. The U.S. Mining Safety and Health Administration MSHA is the primary regulatory organization governing frac sand mining and processing. Accordingly, MSHA regulates quarries, surface mines, underground mines and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with and located at quarries and mines. The mission of MSHA is to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and to enforce compliance with mandatory miner safety and health standards. As part of MSHA s oversight, representatives perform at least two unannounced inspections annually for each above-ground facility. 
 We are also subject to regulations by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which has promulgated rules for workplace exposure to respirable silica for several other industries. Respirable silica is a known health hazard for workers exposed over long periods. In April 2024, MSHA adopted its final rule lowering the permissible exposure limit for respirable crystalline silica, establishing an action level for respirable crystalline silica, implementing medical surveillance for metal/non-metal mines and updating the respiratory protection standard. Airborne respirable silica is associated with work areas at our site and is monitored closely through routine testing and MSHA inspection. We do not expect this to have a material affect on the Company or its operations. 
 32 

Our operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures, operating equipment, and other matters. Our failure to comply with such standards, or changes in such standards or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or otherwise impose significant restrictions on our ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations. Following passage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, MSHA significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining operations. The dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has also increased in recent years. Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.104) is included in Exhibit 95.1 to this Report.

Exhibit 95.1 
 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 
 The following disclosures are provided pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, which requires certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that operate mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). 
 
 Mine Safety Information 
 Whenever the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA believes a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation which describes the alleged violation and fixes a time within which the U.S. mining operator must abate the alleged violation. In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine affected by the condition until the alleged hazards are corrected. When MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the alleged violation, that the operator is ordered to pay. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, may be reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments vary depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the mine as well as by the MSHA inspector(s) assigned. 
 
 Mine Safety Data 
 The following provides additional information about references used in the table below to describe the categories of violations, orders or citations issued by MSHA under the Mine Act

 Compensation Proceedings A compensation proceeding may be filed by miners entitled to compensation when a mine is closed by certain closure orders issued by MSHA. The purpose of the proceeding is to determine the amount of compensation, if any, due to miners idled by the orders. 
 Temporary Relief Applications for temporary relief are applications filed under section 105(b)(2) of the Mine Act for temporary relief from any modification or termination of any order. 
 Appeals An appeal may be filed by an operator to challenge judges decisions or orders to the Commission, including petitions for discretionary review and review by the Commission on its own motion.

 (1) The definition of mine under section 3 of the Mine Act includes the mine, as well as other items used in, or to be used in, or resulting from, the work of extracting minerals, such as land, structures, facilities, equipment, machines, tools 

and minerals preparation facilities. Unless otherwise indicated, any of these other items associated with a single mine have been aggregated in the totals for that mine. MSHA assigns an identification number to each mine and may or may not assign separate identification numbers to related facilities such as preparation facilities. We are providing the information in the table by mine rather than MSHA identification number because that is how we manage and operate our mining business and we believe this presentation will be more useful to investors than providing information based on MSHA identification numbers. 
 
 (2) Represents the total dollar value of the proposed assessments from MSHA under the Mine Act, for the three months preceding September 30, 2024, for all citations orders assessed, not just those disclosed in the rows preceding such dollar value.
