 million of performance obligations relating to firm fixed price contracts that did not qualify for the aforementioned disclosure exemptions. We expect to recognize of these performance obligations by the end of 2024 and the remainder by the end of 2025. 
 
 Rights of return generally are not included in customer contracts. Accordingly, product revenue is recognized upon transfer of control at shipment or delivery, as applicable. Rights of return are evaluated as they occur. 
 
 Revenues recognized at a point in time consist of sales of semiconductor lasers, fiber lasers and other related products. Revenues recognized over time generally consist of development arrangements that are structured based on our costs incurred. For long-term contracts, we estimate the total expected costs to complete the contract and recognize revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred at period end. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, materials, subcontractors costs, other direct costs, and indirect costs applicable on government and commercial contracts. 
 
 Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that may span several 
 years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the performance of subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. Billing under these arrangements generally occurs within one month of the costs being incurred or as milestones are reached.

 Contract liabilities Deferred revenues and other long-term liabilities 
 
 Contract assets generally consist of revenue recognized on an over-time basis where revenue recognition has been met, but the amounts are billed and collected in a subsequent period. In our services contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals, which is generally monthly, or upon the achievement of contractual milestones. Generally, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, we sometimes receive advances or deposits from our customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in contract liabilities recorded in deferred revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities are not a significant financing component as they are generally utilized to pay for contract costs within a one-year period or are used to ensure the customer meets contractual requirements. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. For our product revenue, we generally receive cash payments subsequent to satisfying the performance obligation via delivery of the product, resulting in billed accounts receivable. For our contracts, there are no significant gaps between the receipt of payment and the transfer of the associated goods and services to the customer for material amounts of consideration. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized revenue of thousand and million that was included in the deferred revenues balance at the beginning of the period as the performance obligations under the associated agreements were satisfied.

Overview 
 
 nLIGHT, Inc. is a leading provider of high power semiconductor and fiber lasers for industrial, microfabrication, and aerospace and defense applications. Headquartered in Camas, Washington, we design, develop, and manufacture the critical elements of our lasers, and believe our vertically integrated business model enables us to rapidly introduce innovative products, control our costs and protect our intellectual property. 
 
 We operate in two reportable segments Laser Products and Advanced Development and we serve three primary end-markets Industrial, Microfabrication, and Aerospace and Defense. Sales of our semiconductor lasers, fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers, and other directed energy laser products are included in the Laser Products segment, while revenue earned from research and development contracts are included in the Advanced Development segment. 
 
 Revenues decreased to 151.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 158.0 million in the same period of 2023 due primarily to decreased sales in the Laser Products segment. We generated a net loss of 35.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 28.4 million for the same period of 2023.

Table of Contents 

 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 
 Demand for our Semiconductor and Fiber Laser Solutions 
 
 Our revenue growth depends on market demand and achievement of design wins for our semiconductor and fiber lasers. We consider a design win to occur when a customer notifies us that it has selected one of our products to be incorporated into a product or system under development by such customer. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon capital expenditures by customers in the Industrial and Microfabrication markets, which, in turn, depend upon the demand for these customers products or services. In addition, in the Aerospace and Defense market, our business depends in large part on continued investment in laser technology by the U.S. government and its allies, and our ability to continue to successfully develop leading technology in this area and commercialize that technology in the future. 
 
 Demand for our products also fluctuates based on market cycles, continuously evolving industry supply chains, trade and tariff terms, as well as evolving competitive dynamics in each of our end-markets. Erosion of average selling prices, or ASPs, of established products is typical in our industry, and the ASPs of our products generally decrease as our products mature. We may also negotiate discounted selling prices from time to time with certain customers that purchase higher volumes, or to penetrate new markets or applications. Historically, we have been able to offset decreasing ASPs by introducing new and higher value products, increasing the sales of our existing products, expanding into new applications and reducing our product and manufacturing costs. Although we anticipate further increases in product volumes and the continued introduction of new and higher value products, ASP reduction may cause our revenues to decline or grow at a slower rate. 
 
 Technology and New Product Development 
 
 We invest heavily in the development of our semiconductor, fiber laser, directed energy, and laser-sensing technologies to provide solutions to our current and future customers. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in research and development to achieve our technology and product roadmap. Our product development is targeted to specific sectors of the market where we believe the performance of our products provides a significant benefit to our customers. We believe our close coordination with our customers regarding their future product requirements enhances the efficiency of our research and development expenditures. 
 
 Manufacturing Costs and Gross Margins 
 
 Our product gross profit, in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, is impacted by our product sales mix, sales volumes, changes in ASPs, production volumes, the corresponding absorption of manufacturing overhead expenses, the cost of purchased materials, production costs and manufacturing yields. Our product sales mix can affect gross profits due to variations in profitability related to product configurations and cost profiles, customer volume pricing, availability of competitive products in various markets, and new product introductions, among other factors. We have invested heavily in U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities in the last several years. Capacity utilization affects our gross margin because we have a high fixed cost base due to our vertically integrated business model. Increases in sales and production volumes drive favorable absorption of fixed costs, improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower production costs. Gross margins may fluctuate from period to period depending on product mix and the level of capacity utilization. 
 
 Our Advanced Development gross profit varies with the type and terms of contracts, contract volume, project mix, changes in the estimated cost of projects at completion, and successful execution on projects during the period. Most of our Advanced Development contracts have historically been structured as cost plus fixed fee due to the technical complexity of the research and development services, but we also perform work under fixed price contracts where gross margin can change from period to period based on the estimated cost of the project at completion. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Our quarterly revenues can fluctuate with general economic trends, the timing of capital expenditures by our customers, holidays, and general economic trends. In addition, as is typical in our industry, we tend to recognize a larger percentage of our quarterly revenues in the last month of the quarter, which may impact our working capital trends.

The increase in revenue from the Microfabrication market for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to an increase in unit sales of semiconductor lasers to Rest of World customers due to improved demand. The decrease in revenue from the Microfabrication market for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was driven by lower unit sales for the first six months of 2024 that was partially offset by an increase in unit sales for the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 The increases in revenue from the Aerospace and Defense market for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, were the result of increased unit sales of products due to higher market demand, an increase in ASPs, and increased development revenue from development contracts awarded primarily in the second half of 2023.

 Geographic revenue information is based on the location to which we ship our products. The increases in North America revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, were primarily attributable to increased revenue from the Aerospace and Defense market as previously discussed, offset partially by decreased revenue from the Industrial market. 
 
 The decrease in China revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was the result of decreased revenue from the Microfabrication and Industrial markets. The decrease in China revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was driven by a decreased in revenue from the Industrial market offset partially by an increase in revenue from the Microfabrication market. 
 
 The increase in Rest of World revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was the result of increased revenue from the Aerospace and Defense and Microfabrication markets, offset partially by decreased revenue from the Industrial market. The decrease in Rest of World revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was the result of decreased revenue from both the Industrial and Microfabrication markets, offset partially by increased revenue from the Aerospace and Defense market. 
 
 Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin 
 
 Cost of Laser Products revenue consists primarily of manufacturing materials, labor, shipping and handling costs, tariffs and manufacturing-related overhead. We order materials and supplies based on backlog and forecasted demand from our customers. We expense all warranty costs and inventory provisions as cost of revenues. 
 
 Cost of Advanced Development revenue consists of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, and an allocation of indirect costs including overhead and general and administrative. 
 
 Our gross profit and gross margin were as follows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

 NM = not meaningful 
 
 The increase in Laser Products gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was driven primarily by positive changes in sales mix and increases in ASPs in the Aerospace and Defense market. Our average gross margins on sales for the Industrial market have been lower than those for the Microfabrication and Aerospace and Defense markets. The decrease in Laser Products gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to same period of 2023, was driven by the impact of lower production volumes on fixed manufacturing costs due to the decrease in overall customer demand, partially offset by positive changes in sales mix. 
 
 The decrease in Advanced Development gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was driven by changes in the composition of research and development contracts and a increase in the estimated cost at completion on a significant fixed priced contract in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in Advanced Development gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily the result of changes in the composition of research and development contracts. The nine month period ended September 30, 2024 included more revenue from fixed priced contracts that carried higher average gross margins than cost-plus fixed fee contracts during the period. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Our operating expenses were as follows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Research and development 33,723 34,049 (326) (1.0) 
 
 The increase in research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to an increase in employee compensation costs and project-related spending, offset partially by a decrease in stock-based compensation of 0.6 million. The decrease in research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation of 1.7 million, offset partially by increases in employee compensation costs and project-related spending.

 The increases in sales, general and administrative expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, were primarily due to increases in bad debt expense and stock-based compensation of 0.3 million and 1.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Interest income, net 1,308 990 318 32.1 
 
 The increases in interest income, net, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, were driven by increases in interest rates and increased investment in marketable securities. 
 
 Other Income, net 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Other income, net 1,331 536 795 148.3 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Other income, net 2,594 1,997 597 29.9 
 
 Changes in other income, net, are primarily attributable to realized gains on the sale of marketable securities and changes in net realized and unrealized foreign exchange transactions resulting from currency rate fluctuations. 
 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Income tax expense (benefit) 261 187 74 39.6 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Income tax expense (benefit) 525 (1,005) 1,530 152.2 
 
 We record income tax expense for taxes in our foreign jurisdictions including Austria, Finland, Italy, and South Korea. While our tax expense is largely dependent on the geographic mix of earnings related to our foreign operations, we also record tax expense for uncertain tax positions taken and associated penalties and interest. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our deferred tax assets. Due to the uncertainty with respect to their ultimate realizability in

Table of Contents 

 the United States and China, we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The increase in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to a benefit for expiring statutes of limitations on unrecognized tax positions in the second quarter of 2023 and accrued interest on unrecognized tax positions. The increase in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was mainly driven by an increase in income in foreign jurisdictions. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 41.7 million and 53.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, we had marketable securities of 65.2 million and 59.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our total balance of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities decreased by 6.2 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our principal source of liquidity was cash collected from customers. We believe our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from period to period and will depend on many factors, including the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the continuing market acceptance of our products and ongoing investments to support the growth of our business. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property rights. From time to time, we may explore additional financing sources which could include equity, equity linked and debt financing arrangements. 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,528 9,687 Net cash used in investing activities (10,923) (13,163) Net cash used in financing activities (2,369) (2,062) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 12 (198) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (11,752) (5,736) 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 1.5 million, which was the result of a 35.8 million net loss, offset by a decrease in net working capital of 2.7 million and non-cash expenses totaling 34.7 million related primarily to depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. The decrease in net working capital in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by a 3.3 million decrease in inventory, a 1.0 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a 4.6 million increase in accounts payable and a 2.5 million increase in accrued and other long-term liabilities. These increases were offset by a 2.1 million increase in accounts receivable, a 3.4 million increase in other assets, net, a 1.9 million decrease in deferred revenues and a 1.5 million decrease in lease liabilities. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 10.9 million, which was driven by the net purchase of marketable securities of 5.6 million and capital expenditures of 5.3 million. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 2.4 million, which consisted of taxes paid on the net settlement of stock awards of 3.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases of 1.6 million. 
 
 Credit Facilities 
 24 

Table of Contents 

We have a 40.0 million revolving line of credit, or LOC, with Banc of California dated September 24, 2018, which is secured by our assets. 
 
 On September 27, 2024, we amended the LOC to extend the maturity date to September 24, 2027, updated financial covenants, and amend the unused line fee and interest rate applicable to revolving loans. 
 
 The LOC agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants and bears an unused credit fee of 0.25 on an annualized basis. The interest rate on the LOC is based on the Prime Rate, minus a margin based on our liquidity levels. No amounts were outstanding under the LOC at September 30, 2024 and we were in compliance with all covenants. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, If our costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 For financial market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, reference is made to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, contained in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our exposure to market risk has not changed materially since December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation, effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Control 
 
 Control systems, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives are being met. Further, the design of any control systems must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of all controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Control systems can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business, but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.
