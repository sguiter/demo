 of the outstanding equity interests in MER, in accordance with the contribution agreement dated July 9, 2024 (the MER Acquisition ). The integration of our legacy business with MER s operations is expected to enhance our capabilities in providing mobile, configurable equipment solutions and logistics services to our customers across various industries. The MER Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The fair value of the total purchase consideration transferred was million, consisting of the following amounts: Solaris LLC units and an equal number of Class B Common Stock (the "equity consideration") Cash Paid for Capital Expenditures Reimbursement Initial Cash Consideration (net of initial working capital adjustments) Cash Paid for MER's Closing Cash Balance Fair Value of Total Purchase Consideration Transferred The fair value of the equity consideration was determined using the closing price of the Class A common stock on the acquisition date, which was per share. Although not publicly traded, the equity consideration is exchangeable on a one-for- basis for shares of Class A common stock. Additionally, the Class B common stock possess identical economic and voting rights as the Class A common stock. According to the contribution agreement, if Solaris has any indemnity claim against the sellers of the acquired business (the Sellers ), the Sellers will satisfy such claims by surrendering a portion of the equity consideration, up to a maximum of Class B common shares (the indemnity equity ). In the absence of indemnity claims, half of the indemnity equity will be released on the anniversary of the acquisition closing date, with the remaining half released on the anniversary. The equity consideration is subject to contractual sale restrictions, resulting from a lock-up period of following the acquisition closing date, as stipulated in the lock-up agreements between the Sellers and Solaris. The restrictions on indemnity equity will remain in effect until the respective release dates. Additionally, the cash consideration was equal to million subject to certain adjustments, including net working capital to be delivered upon closing of the MER Acquisition. We have calendar days from the acquisition closing date to finalize the determination of the cash consideration. Our preliminary calculations of working capital adjustments indicate that the initial cash consideration paid at closing was overstated, resulting in a balance due from the Sellers of million, which is classified as other receivables in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. This estimated adjustment to the cash consideration has not been finalized and is therefore subject to change. Any changes to other receivables would result in an offsetting change to goodwill.

 Accounts receivable Inventories Prepaid expenses and other current assets Property and equipment and equipment held for lease Operating lease right-of-use assets Intangible assets - customer relationships (1) Intangible assets - trademarks (2) Total assets acquired Accounts payable Accrued liabilities Deferred revenue Operating lease liabilities Finance lease liabilities Deferred tax liabilities Total liabilities assumed Net assets acquired Goodwill (1) Customer relationships are being amortized over a 10-year life. (2) Trademarks are being amortized over a 5-year life. The fair value of the acquired property and equipment and equipment held for lease was determined using both cost and market approaches. The cost approach was primarily employed, which involved estimating the replacement cost of the assets and adjusting this amount for their age, condition and utility. The market approach was also considered, analyzing recent transactions of comparable property and equipment to establish a fair market value. The valuation methods used to determine the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets included the multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships and the relief from royalty method for trademarks. Several significant assumptions were involved in the application of these valuation methods, including forecasted sales volumes and prices, royalty rates, contributory asset charges, discount rates and estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. These identifiable intangible assets have finite lives and are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives. The value assigned to goodwill in connection with the business combination is million. This goodwill has been allocated to our Solaris Power Solutions segment and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, reflecting the assembled workforce and expected growth opportunities available to us resulting from the MER Acquisition. The amount of goodwill deductible for tax purposes is million. Additionally, goodwill was increased by the deferred tax liability associated with the fair market value exceeding the tax basis of the acquired assets. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. Due to the timing of the MER Acquisition s completion, the purchase price and related allocation are preliminary and may be revised. Adjustments could arise from changes to the purchase price, additional information obtained regarding the acquired assets and assumed liabilities and revisions to preliminary estimates of fair values including, but not limited to, certain intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, contractual relationships, intangible assets, certain working capital items, deferred income taxes and residual goodwill. These adjustments to the purchase price allocation could be significant. The final allocation will be completed within the measurement period, which may extend up to one year from the acquisition date.

These costs primarily consisted of legal and consulting fees and are included in other operating expense, net in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. The following table reflects pro forma revenues and net income for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, assuming the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2023. It also includes non-recurring pro forma adjustments to exclude the aforementioned acquisition-related costs. These unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that would have been achieved during the periods presented, nor do they predict future performance. Net income (loss) ) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our condensed consolidated statements of operations included revenue of million and pre-tax income of million from the MER Acquisition. distinct business segments. These segments differ by their revenue generating activities and align with how our chief operating decision maker assesses operating performance and allocates resources. Our reporting segments are: Solaris Logistics Solutions designs and manufactures specialized equipment that enables the efficient management of raw materials used in the completion of oil and natural gas wells. Solaris equipment-based logistics services includes field technician support, software solutions, and may also include last mile and mobilization services. Solaris Power Solutions provides configurable sets of natural gas-powered mobile turbines and ancillary equipment. This segment primarily leases equipment to data center and oilfield customers and is focused on continuing to grow its services with these customers as well as across multiple commercial and industrial end-markets. 
 We evaluate the performance of our business segments based on certain financial information, including Adjusted EBITDA. We define EBITDA as net income plus depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, and income tax expense. We defined Adjusted EBTIDA as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation, loss on debt extinguishment, and certain non-cash items and any extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring gains, losses or expenses.

Property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value. , while customer relationships are amortized over , aligning with the estimated economic benefit.

Financial covenants require Solaris to maintain a ratio of consolidated annualized EBITDA minus unfinanced capital expenditures and cash taxes to fixed charges (including interest payments, principal repayments and certain dividend payments) of at least 1:25 :1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, beginning with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2025. Additionally, Solaris must maintain a ratio of consolidated net debt (subject to cash netting limitations) to consolidated annualized EBITDA of no greater than 3.25 :1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2025, and no greater than 3.00 :1.00 for each fiscal quarter thereafter. Repayment of borrowings will begin in quarterly installments on September 30, 2025, at a rate of of the original principal amount, subject to certain adjustments for prepayments. Prior to September 11, 2027, borrowings may be voluntarily prepaid, subject to a call protection amount as outlined in the Term Loan Agreement. After September 11, 2027, prepayments may be made without penalty or premium. Solaris is also required to make prepayments from proceeds of certain indebtedness, upon the issuance of equity securities, and beginning with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2025, based on a percentage of excess cash flow, governed by a leverage-based grid outlined in the Term Loan Agreement. The outstanding amounts will mature on September 11, 2029. To secure the borrowings, Solaris and its subsidiaries have pledged substantially all their assets as collateral for the benefit of the lenders. Borrowings are subject to acceleration upon customary events of default, including failure to pay principal or interest, violations of covenants and defaults on other indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, an outstanding principal amount of million is presented as current debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Revolving Credit Facility On September 11, 2024, Solaris extinguished its prior revolving credit facility, which was settled using proceeds from the Term Loan Agreement. A loss on debt extinguishment of million was recorded in the statements of operations, reflecting the difference between the carrying amount of the extinguished debt and the consideration paid. On October 2, 2024, Solaris and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new revolving credit facility with Bank of America, acting as agent for the participating lenders. The facility provides for borrowings up to the lesser of million and a borrowing base determined by a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory, subject to reserves and other adjustments. At Solaris s option, and provided certain conditions are met, the facility may be increased by up to an additional million. Additionally, up to million of the facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit by the agent. Solaris intends to use the proceeds from this revolving credit facility for working capital and other corporate purposes. This facility matures on October 2, 2029, with provisions for earlier termination under specific conditions. As of September 30, 2024, Solaris incurred debt financing costs of million related to this new facility, which are recorded as non-current asset in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized as interest expense in the statements of operations over the term of the facility using the straight-line method.

 million senior secured bridge term loan facility in anticipation of the MER Acquisition, which was completed on September 11, 2024. Since alternative financing through the Term Loan Agreement was obtained on the acquisition closing date, Solaris extinguished the bridge term loan facility, which had not been utilized, on the same date. A loss on debt extinguishment of million was recorded on the condensed consolidated statement of operations, reflecting the unamortized portion of debt financing costs associated with securing the bridge financing. Payments of Debt Obligations Due by Period As of September 30, 2024, the schedule of the repayment requirements of long-term debt is as follows: 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total future principal debt payments million and million to all Solaris LLC unitholders in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which million and million was paid to Solaris Energy Infrastructure, Inc. Solaris Inc. ). Solaris LLC paid dividend distributions totaling million and million to all Solaris LLC unitholders in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which million and million was paid to Solaris Inc. Solaris Inc. used the proceeds from the distributions to pay quarterly cash dividends to all holders of shares of Class A common stock. Share Repurchase Program On March 1, 2023, the Company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan to repurchase up to million of the Company s Class A common stock until the plan terminates pursuant to its provisions. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Solaris Inc. did not purchase and retire any shares of the Company s Class A common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Solaris Inc. purchased and retired shares of the Company s Class A common stock at an aggregate cost of million, or per share, under the share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, we had purchased and retired shares of Class A common stock for million, or per share, resulting in million remaining available for future repurchases authorized under the share repurchase plan. The U.S. federal excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. corporations enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 applies to our share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, we recorded accrued stock repurchase excise tax of million in accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Noncontrolling Interest Solaris Inc. serves as the sole managing member of Solaris LLC and consolidates Solaris LLC in its consolidated financial statements. Noncontrolling interest represents Solaris LLC units held by members other than Solaris Inc. In connection with the acquisition of MER by Solaris Inc. and Solaris LLC, Solaris LLC issued Solaris LLC units to the Sellers as part of the purchase consideration, thereby increasing the noncontrolling interest in Solaris

 as of September 30, 2024. Concurrently, an equal number of shares of Class B common stock of Solaris Inc. were issued by Solaris Inc. to the Sellers. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net income attributable to Class A common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the same period. Diluted earnings per share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive shares. The following table sets forth the calculation of earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Less: income attributable to participating securities (1) ) ) ) ) Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders - basic ) Net income attributable to non-controlling interest (2) Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders - diluted (2) ) Denominator Weighted average number of unrestricted outstanding common shares - basic Effect of dilutive Class B common stock Diluted weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share Earnings per share of Class A common stock - basic ) Earnings per share of Class A common stock - diluted ) (1) The Company s unvested restricted stock awards are participating securities because they entitle the holders to non-forfeitable rights to dividends until the awards vest or are forfeited.

 million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a combined United States federal and state expense for income taxes of million and million, respectively. The effective combined United States federal and state income tax rates were - and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective combined United States federal and state income tax rates were and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to Solaris LLC s treatment as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. The Company s deferred tax position reflects the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting. The largest components of the Company s deferred tax position relate to the Company s investment in Solaris LLC and net operating loss carryovers. The Company recorded a deferred tax asset and additional paid-in capital for the difference between the book value and the tax basis of the Company s investment in Solaris LLC. This difference originates from the equity offerings of Class A common stock, exchanges of Solaris LLC units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock, and issuances of Class A common stock, and corresponding Solaris LLC units, in connection with stock-based compensation. Based on our cumulative earnings history and forecasted future sources of taxable income, we believe that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future. As the Company reassesses this position in the future, changes in cumulative earnings history, excluding non-recurring charges, or changes to forecasted taxable income may alter this expectation and may result in an increase in the valuation allowance and an increase in the effective tax rate. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryovers and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An ownership change is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50 of a corporation s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5 or more of the stock of a corporation, or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 generally imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change net operating loss carryovers to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. We do not believe the Section 382 annual limitation related to historical ownership changes impacts our ability to utilize our net operating losses; however, if we were to experience a future ownership change our ability to use net operating losses may be impacted. Payables Related to the Tax Receivable Agreement On May 17, 2017, in connection with its initial public offering, Solaris Inc. entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (the Tax Receivable Agreement with the then-existing members of Solaris LLC. The Tax Receivable Agreement was later amended on June 27, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our liability under the Tax Receivable Agreement was million, of which million was current, representing of the net cash savings in United States federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that Solaris Inc. anticipates realizing in future years from certain increases in tax basis and certain tax benefits attributable to imputed interest as a result of Solaris Inc. s acquisition (or deemed acquisition for United States federal income tax purposes) of Solaris LLC units in connection with our initial public offering or pursuant to previous exercises of the Redemption Right or the Call Right (each as

 ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations References to we, us, our, Solaris or the Company refer to Solaris Energy Infrastructure, Inc. (either individually or together with its subsidiaries, as the context requires). The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and related notes. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated as discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those described above in Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and Risk Factors included in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC, all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by law. Executive Overview We provide mobile and scalable equipment-based solutions for use in distributed power generation as well as the management of raw materials used in the completion of oil and natural gas wells. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Solaris serves multiple U.S. end markets, including energy, data centers, and other commercial and industrial sectors. We operate through two reportable business segments: Solaris Logistics Solutions: This segment designs and manufactures specialized equipment that, when combined with field technician support, last mile and mobilization logistics services, and our software solutions, enables us to deliver comprehensive offerings that enhance efficiencies for oil and natural gas operators and their suppliers. Solaris Power Solutions: This segment offers configurable all-electric natural gas-powered mobile turbines and ancillary equipment. We lease this equipment to data center, energy, and other commercial and industrial sector customers. This segment was created following our recent acquisition of Mobile Energy Rentals LLC MER, and such acquisition, the MER Acquisition ). 
 On September 11, 2024, we acquired MER, a company providing configurable, primarily natural gas-powered mobile turbines and ancillary equipment across energy, data center, and other commercial and industrial markets. This acquisition marks our entry into the scaled distributed power solutions market, strengthening our position as a mobile equipment and logistics solution provider in the oil and gas sector while diversifying our overall business. Recent Developments MER Acquisition We successfully completed the acquisition of MER on September 11, 2024. The results of MER s operations have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date through September 30, 2024. For further details regarding the acquisition, please refer to Note 2. MER Acquisition in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Debt Financing On September 11, 2024, we entered into a senior secured term loan agreement totaling 325.0 million, primarily to fund the acquisition of MER. The remaining proceeds are restricted for capital expenditures to support our growth initiatives. The term loan bears a variable interest rate with interest payments due beginning in October 2024. Repayments of 1.25 of the original principal amount are due in quarterly installments beginning on September 30, 2025. The term loan matures on September 11, 2029. Additionally, on the same day, we extinguished our prior revolving credit facility using a portion of the term loan proceeds. Subsequently, on October 2, 2024, we established a new revolving credit facility that allows for borrowings up

 to 75.0 million, with a potential increase of up to an additional 50.0 million, contingent on certain conditions. This facility also includes provisions for up to 10.0 million in letters of credit. For further details regarding our debt agreements, please refer to Note 10. Debt in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Market Trends and Outlook Demand for our services varies across each of our business segments, Solaris Logistics Solutions and Solaris Power Solutions, due to differences in end market exposure. For Solaris Logistics Solutions, demand is predominantly influenced by the level of oil and natural gas well drilling and completion activity in the U.S. During the third quarter of 2024, our fully utilized system count remained relatively flat, which was in line with a relatively stable Baker Hughes U.S. Land Rig count. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect our fully utilized system count to decline roughly 10 primarily due to seasonality, which includes the impact of weather, holidays and customer budget completion. The level of demand over the longer term will depend on multiple factors, including commodity price levels, customer consolidation that can drive activity and procurement strategy changes and industry efficiency gains, geopolitical risk, economic activity, potential regulatory changes and potential impacts from geopolitical disruptions. For Solaris Power Solutions, demand is predominantly influenced by accelerating needs for power in the U.S., juxtaposed against constrained electrical grid infrastructure, which is due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, aging transmission and distribution networks, extreme weather, and long lead times for various electric infrastructure equipment. Solaris turbine offerings are configurable and can be scaled to match power demand on a behind-the-meter basis in a shorter timeline than many grid-based providers can service. Today, Solaris Power Solutions primary customers include a large data center and several energy companies requiring power for hydrocarbon production, processing, transportation, and refining applications. Power demand for data centers is primarily driven by rapid demand growth for generative artificial intelligence AI computing applications. Power demand for energy customers is primarily driven by hydrocarbon production and processing operations in geographies where grid infrastructure may not be available or reliable or is prone to supply disruption. Many of our customers face multi-year delays to receive grid-based power and are turning to configurable, behind-the-meter solutions such as ours to bridge this gap. The availability of low-cost fuel as a result of the abundant supply of natural gas domestically enhances the cost-competitiveness of our mobile natural gas-powered turbine technology as compared to conventional grid-based power. During the third quarter, Solaris Power Solutions generated revenue from an average of approximately 156 megawatts MW of generation capacity. Due to the continued market demand we forecast for behind-the-meter power generation, Solaris Power Solutions has secured deliveries for turbines and ancillary equipment that will significantly increase our power generation fleet to approximately 535 MW by the third quarter of 2025. The Company estimates approximately 450 MW, or 84 of total expected delivered capacity, is currently committed to customers under commercial agreements that range in tenor from two to four years. We expect total company capital expenditures over the next four quarters of approximately 295 million, of which 130 million is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. The majority of these capital expenditures are to support Solaris Power Solutions capital growth. Capital expenditures for Solaris Logistics Solutions represents approximately 10-15 million of our total expected capital expenditures over the next four quarters. We intend to fund our current planned capital expenditures with proceeds from our recent debt financing and cash flow from operations. The sustainability of this favorable supply-demand dynamic in the power sector will depend on multiple factors, including continued demand growth for generative AI computing applications, supply chain availability for electrical equipment, potential regulatory changes, overall economic activity levels, the level and pace at which the power industry can invest in power infrastructure, and the pace of continued electrification-driven demand growth.

 Results of Operations Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenues 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) (in thousands) Revenues Solaris Logistics Solutions 70,279 69,676 603 212,055 229,600 (17,545) Solaris Power Solutions 4,739 4,739 4,739 4,739 Total revenues 75,018 69,676 5,342 216,794 229,600 (12,806) Solaris Logistics Solutions. Solaris Logistics Solutions revenue remained relatively flat in the third quarter of 2024, increasing by 0.6 million, or 1 , to 70.3 million compared to 69.7 million in the same period of 2023. This modest growth was primarily due to an increase in last mile tonnage during the quarter. However, this was partially offset by a decrease in fully utilized systems, which decreased to 91 in the third quarter of 2024, down from 108 in the same period of 2023. Solaris Logistics Solutions revenue decreased by 17.5 million, or 8 , to 212.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 229.6 million in the same period of 2023. This decline was primarily due to a decrease in fully utilized systems, which dropped to 95 for the first nine months of 2024 from 112 in the same period of 2023. Solaris Power Solutions. Solaris Power Solutions revenue increased by 4.7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023. This increase was due to the MER Acquisition completed on September 11, 2024. Cost of Revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization

Solaris Logistics Solutions cost of revenue increased by 3.5 million, or 8 , to 45.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 42.1 million in the same period of 2023, primarily due to a 7.4 million increase in last mile and ancillary service costs associated with an increase in last mile tonnage. This increase was partially offset by a 3.8 million reduction in system costs due to lower fully utilized system count and reversal of 1.8 million accrued property taxes following a settlement agreement with Brown County Appraisal District. Refer to Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies Tax Matters in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. Solaris Logistics Solutions cost of revenue decreased by 9.3 million, or 7 , to 131.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 141.0 million in the same period of 2023. This reduction was primarily due to lower system count, lower last mile trucking costs for ancillary services and the reversal of accrued property taxes following settlement with Brown County Appraisal District. Refer to Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies Tax Matters , in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the property tax settlement.

 Solaris Logistics Solutions cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 65 and 62 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 60 and 61 for the same periods ended September 30, 2023. Solaris Power Solutions. Solaris Power Solutions cost of revenue increased by 1.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was due to the MER Acquisition completed on September 11, 2024. Solaris Power Solutions cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 27 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased by 1.8 million, or 20 , to 11.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 9.2 million in the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily due to depreciation of 1.4 million from assets acquired in the MER Acquisition. Depreciation and amortization increased by 3.8 million, or 14 , to 30.5 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 26.7 million in the same period of 2023. This increase was driven by depreciation from the MER Acquisition and additional depreciable assets resulting from capital expenditures to develop and upgrade systems fleet for our Solaris Logistics Solutions segment. Gain on Reversal of Property Tax Contingency On June 14, 2024, we reached a settlement agreement with Brown County Appraisal District in Texas, following a favorable ruling by the Eastland Court of Appeals on April 18, 2024. As a result, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reversed 4.3 million of property tax expenses previously recorded through 2023 in connection with this case. Of this amount, 2.5 million was presented as gain on reversal of property tax contingency and 1.8 million reduced the costs of services in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 2.4 million, or 38 , to 8.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 6.4 million in the same period of 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 5.3 million, or 27 , to 25.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 19.7 million in the same period of 2023. The increase in these periods was primarily due to an increase in salaries, benefits and wages driven by an increase in average headcount, as well as increased professional fees and office rent. Other Operating Expense, net Other operating expense increased by 2.4 million to 3.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 0.6 million in the same period of 2023. Other operating expense increased by 3.6 million, to 3.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 0.1 million in the same period of 2023. Other operating expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relate to acquisition-related costs and credit losses. Other operating expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily relate to loss on sale of assets and credit losses, partially offset with sales tax rebates. Provision for Income Taxes During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a combined United States federal and state expense for income taxes of 0.5 million, a decrease of 0.8 million as compared to the 1.3 million income tax expense we recognized during the same period in 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, we recognized a combined United States federal and state expense for income taxes of 3.7 million, a decrease of 2.8 million as compared to the 6.5 million income tax expense we recognized during the same period in 2023. This change was attributable to changes in operating gains. The effective combined United States federal and state income tax rates were -26.3 and 14.6 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective combined United States federal and state income tax rates were 19.7 and 

 31 

Table of Contents 
 16.9 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to Solaris LLC s treatment as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, borrowings under our debt financing agreements and available capacity from our revolving credit facility. We utilize this liquidity to support ongoing operations, fund capital expenditures for growth, such as new turbines and related ancillary equipment for our power solutions segment and pay dividends. Additionally, while no assurance can be given, we may seek to issue additional securities through opportunistic capital markets transactions, depending upon market conditions and other relevant factors. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of 325.0 million under our senior secured term loan agreement, with 4.1 million in principal payments due within the next twelve months. The interest rate on the term loan was 11.1 as of that date and is subject to periodic repricing. Assuming this rate remains constant, we estimate our interest payments for the next twelve months will total approximately 36.6 million. Additionally, we had outstanding purchase commitments of 219.2 million related to growth capital expenditures, payable within the next twelve months. We believe that our current cash reserves, operating cash flow, available capacity under our new revolving credit facility and the potential to issue additional equity, if needed, will provide adequate liquidity to meet our future operational needs, including repayment of debt service obligations and dividend payments. Dividends On October 30, 2024, the Company s board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0.12 per share of Class A common stock, payable on December 16, 2024, to holders of record as of December 6, 2024. Additionally, a distribution of 0.12 per unit will be made to Solaris LLC unitholders, with the same payment and record dates. Share Repurchase Program The Company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program on March 1, 2023, with an approved limit of 50.0 million and no set term limits. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase nor retire any shares of Class A common stock under the share repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased and retired 1,108,349 shares of Class A common stock at an aggregate cost of 8.1 million, or 7.30 per share, under the share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, we have collectively repurchased and retired 4,272,127 shares of Class A common stock for 34.6 million, or 8.09 per share, resulting in 15.4 million remaining under the authorized share repurchase program. All purchases made pursuant to the authorized share repurchase plan were made in accordance with applicable securities laws from time to time in the open-market or through private transactions, depending on market conditions. Going forward, future purchases may be made pursuant to a trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b-18 or Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act, and may be discontinued at any time.

 Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 46,267 64,678 (18,411) Net cash used in investing activities (189,949) (54,830) (135,119) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 254,390 (15,232) 269,622 Net change in cash 110,708 (5,384) 116,092 Significant Sources and Uses of Cash Flows Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 46.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 64.7 million for the same period in 2023. This 18.4 million decline is primarily attributed to reduced business activity, reflected in the decrease in our fully utilized systems. Consequently, our net income, adjusted for non-cash items, was 61.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 72.5 million in the same period in 2023. Additionally, changes in working capital led to a 15.7 million decrease in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 7.8 million decrease in cash in the same period in 2023. Investing Activities . Net cash used in investing activities was 189.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase from 54.8 million during the same period in 2023. The 135.1 million increase is mainly attributed to 122.1 million used in the business acquisition of MER and 55.2 million paid for turbine progress payments. This increase was partially offset by the absence of capital expenditures from our previous growth capital program in 2023. Financing Activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities totaled 254.4 million. This amount primarily reflects net debt financing proceeds of 295.0 million, partially offset by payments of 14.5 million on debt financing and debt extinguishment costs, 10.9 million in quarterly dividends to Class A common stock shareholders, 8.1 million on share repurchases, and 4.9 million in distributions to Solaris LLC unitholders. In comparison, net cash used in financing activities was 15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was largely due to 25.8 million spent on share repurchases, 10.4 million in quarterly dividends to Class A common stock shareholders and 5.0 million in distributions to Solaris LLC unitholders, partially offset by 29.0 million in net borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. Future Uses of Cash Our material cash commitments consist primarily of obligations under our debt financing, purchase commitments as part of the power generation fleet growth program, Tax Receivable Agreement, insurance premium financing, obligations under our finance and operating leases, dividend payments, and purchase obligations as part of normal operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Refer to Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations included in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein for a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates For detailed information, please refer to Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2023, except for the following additional critical accounting estimate.

 Fair Value Measurements in Business Combinations When accounting for a business acquisition, we allocate the purchase consideration to the various acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their fair values. Our measurement of fair value involved significant estimates and assumptions and we have up to one year post-acquisition to finalize these measurements if necessary. For tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, we employ various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow analyses. These analyses rely on assumptions regarding the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses. Key assumptions include discount rates, future revenues, operating costs, and projections of capital expenditures, aligned with those used by principal market participants. Given the complexity of these calculations, we engage third-party specialists to assist in evaluating our assumptions and appropriately measuring the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except with regard to interest rate risk, as described below. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates associated with our variable-rate borrowings under debt financing agreements. Changes in interest rates directly affect our interest expense. Borrowings under our senior secured term loan are subject to a variable interest rate that, at Solaris s option, is determined by either Term SOFR plus an applicable margin or the Base Rate (as defined in the senior secured term loan agreement) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is 5.0 for Base Rate loans and 6.0 for Term SOFR loans, subject to adjustments of up to an additional 0.25 based on Solaris s then-current leverage ratio if certain conditions are not met. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of 325.0 million under the senior secured term loan agreement. A hypothetical increase or decrease of 100 basis points in our variable interest rates would result in an estimated annual change in interest expense of approximately 3.3 million. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls refer to controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated by our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, and summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in our internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in Note 2. MER Acquisition included in the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein, we acquired MER on September 11, 2024, and its total revenues constituted approximately 6 of total revenues as shown on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024. MER s total assets constituted approximately 42 of total assets as shown on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. We excluded MER s disclosure controls and procedures related to its internal control over financial reporting from the scope of management s assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. This exclusion is in accordance with the guidance issued by the Staff of the SEC that an assessment of recent business combinations may be omitted from management s assessment of

 internal control over financial reporting for one year following the acquisition. As part of the Company s ongoing integration activities, the Company s financial reporting controls and procedures are in the process of being implemented at MER. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Due to the nature of our business, we may become, from time to time, involved in routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities. In the opinion of our management, there are no pending litigation, disputes or claims against us which, if decided adversely, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations other than the lawsuit by Masaba Inc. as discussed in detail in Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation and Claims included in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein. Item 1A. Risk Factors Factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity and the trading price of our Class A common stock are described under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. As of the date of this filing, there have been no material updates to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 except as disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and described herein. Solaris faces a variety of risks related to its entry into a new line of business following the completion of the MER Acquisition. Solaris s entry into scaled distributed power solutions is expected to enhance Solaris s position as a mobile equipment and logistics solution provider to the oil and gas industry as well as diversify its business. Entry into a new line of business may also subject Solaris to new laws and regulations with which it is not familiar and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. Further, Solaris s management team has not directly engaged in the distributed power solutions business before, and its lack of experience may result in delays or further complications to the new business. If Solaris is unable to successfully implement the acquired business of MER, its revenue and profitability may not grow as it expects, its competitiveness may be materially and adversely affected, and its reputation and business may be harmed. The market price for our Class A common stock following the closing of the MER Acquisition may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected or currently affect our Class A common stock. Results of operations of Solaris following the completion of the MER Acquisition may be affected by some factors that are different from those that have affected Solaris s results of operations in the past. Accordingly, the market price and performance of our Class A common stock is likely to be different from the performance of our Class A common stock in the absence of the MER Acquisition. In addition, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.

Table of Contents 
 Solaris incurred significant additional indebtedness in connection with the MER Acquisition, which indebtedness may limit the Company s operating or financial flexibility and could subject the Company to potential defaults under the applicable financing agreements. Upon closing of the MER Acquisition Solaris entered into a senior secured term loan agreement in the principal amount of 325 million to fund the MER Acquisition and the capital commitments contemplated at the acquisition closing date. Solaris also entered into a new revolving credit facility, which provides for borrowings up to the lesser of 75 million and a borrowing base determined by a percentage of eligibles accounts. These financing agreements could have negative consequences on Solaris, including, among other things, (i) requiring Solaris to dedicate a larger portion of cash flow from operations to servicing and repayment of the debt, (ii) reducing funds available for strategic initiatives and opportunities, working capital and other general corporate needs, (iii) limiting Solaris s ability to incur additional indebtedness, which could restrict flexibility to react to changes in the business, its industry and economic condition following the Contribution, and (iv) placing Solaris at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt. Additionally, the financing agreements subject the Company to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on incurring additional debt and certain distributions, as well as a certain leverage and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios Solaris must maintain. Solaris s ability to comply with these financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond its control. If it is unable to remain in compliance with the financial covenants of the financing agreements, then amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become due immediately or Solaris may be unable to access the funds available. Any such acceleration or unavailability of funds could have a material adverse effect on Solaris s financial condition and results of operations. The Company s Solaris Power Solutions segment is dependent on its relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment for its business. The power generation business is dependent on a limited number of key suppliers for access to the unique equipment used in the provision of the Company s offering. If the Company fails to maintain adequate relationships with such suppliers or if it fails to receive equipment from its suppliers in a timely manner, then its competitive position may be harmed and its operations, financial conditions and/or cash flows may be negatively impacted. In addition, the prices of certain equipment may continue to experience inflationary pressures that could further increase such costs. The Company may not be able to pass on these costs to its customers, which could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Unavailability of, and lengthy delays in obtaining, the necessary equipment may result from a number of factors affecting the Company s suppliers including capacity constraints, labor shortages or disputes, supplier product quality issues and suppliers allocations to other purchasers. These risks can be magnified in a weak economic environment or following increases in demand arising from an economic downturn, but are also generally present due to the nature of the Company s business and its dependence on highly-specialized equipment. Such disruptions could result in the Company s inability to effectively meet the needs of its customers and could result in a material adverse effect on operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Many of the Company s power systems involve long sales cycles. The sales cycle for the Company s power systems, from initial contact with potential customers to the commencement of field delivery, may be lengthy. Customers generally consider a wide range of solutions before making a decision to rent or to purchase power systems. Before a customer commits to rent or purchase power systems, they often require a significant technical review, assessment of competitive offerings and approval at a number of management levels within their organization. During the time the Company s customers are evaluating its offerings, the Company may incur substantial sales and marketing, engineering, and research and development expenses.

 The Company s customers may not continue to outsource their power system needs. The Company s customers can evaluate a wide range of applications and equipment to address standby and/or prime power generation needs. As a result of the significant resources and expertise required to develop these systems, certain of these customers have historically chosen to outsource the provision of power generation to the Company. To a significant extent, the Company depends on customers continuing to outsource their power generation needs. Customers may not continue to outsource as much or any of their power generation needs in the future or may seek alternative solutions. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities None. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The following table presents the total number of shares of our Class A common stock that we purchased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the average price paid per share:
