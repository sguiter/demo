CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Report contains forward-looking statements about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements
contained in this Report other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and
financial position, our business strategy and plans, projected costs and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements.
In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as believe, may, 
 will, estimate, continue, anticipate, should, shall, 
 intend, goal, objective, seek, expect, and similar expressions
or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. We
have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we
believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and
objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including
but not limited to: 

our
 limited operating history on which to judge our performance and assess our prospects for future success; 

risks
 related to our reliance on a network of independent dealers and distributors to manage the retail distribution of many of our products; 

our
 reliance on third-party manufacturers and supplies for our products; 

risks
 related to the fact that the majority of the products we purchase are manufactured by suppliers in China and their operations are
 subject to risks associated with business operations in China; 

the
 inexperience of our principal shareholder and senior management in operating a publicly traded company; 

economic
 conditions that impact consumer spending may have a material adverse effect on our business; 

results
 of operations or financial condition; 

risks
 related to face intense competition in all product lines, including from some competitors that have greater financial and marketing
 resources; 

risks
 related to our ability to attract and retain key personnel; 

potential
 harm caused by misappropriation of our data and compromises in cybersecurity; 

changes
 in laws, regulatory requirements, governmental incentives and fuel and energy prices; 

litigation,
 regulatory proceedings, complaints, product liability claims and/or adverse publicity; 

the
 inability of our dealers, customers and distributors to secure adequate access to capital or financing; 

failure
 to develop brand name and reputation; 

the
 significant product repair and/or replacement due to product warranty claims or product recalls; 

the
 impact of health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on our business; and 

other
 risks and uncertainties described in this Report, including those described in the Risk Factors section. 

Moreover,
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management
to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of
these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Report may not occur and actual results could
differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. 

You
should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking
statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable,
we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake
no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this Report or to conform these statements to actual results
or revised expectations. 

In
addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These
statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Report, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable
basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have
conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain,
and you are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. 

You
should read this Report and the documents that we reference in this Report and have filed as exhibits to the registration statement,
of which this Report is a part, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from
what we expect. We qualify all of the forward-looking statements in this Report by these cautionary statements.

Sales
returns 

The
Company provides a refund policy to accept returns from end customers, which varies and depends on different products and customers.
The estimated sales returns are determined based upon an analysis of historical sales returns. Return allowances are recorded as a
reduction in sales with corresponding sales return liabilities which are included in accrued return liabilities. The
estimated cost of returned inventory is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales and an increase of right of return assets which is
included in inventories. The factors affecting the Company s sales return liabilities include the number of
products currently within the return period, historical and anticipated rates of sales returns claimed on those products, and the
estimated amount of returns that may be claimed within this period. If actual results differ from the estimates, the Company revises
its estimated sales returns liability accordingly. Each quarter, the Company reviews and reassesses the adequacy of its recorded
sales returns liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 
and 
of sales return liabilities associated with estimated product returns were recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet, respectively. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded sales returns of 
and respectively.
During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded sales returns of 
and respectively. 

Products
warranty 

The
Company generally provides a one-year limited warranty against defects in materials related to the sale of products. The Company
considers the warranty as an assurance type warranty since the warranty provides the customers the assurance that the product
complies with agreed-upon specifications. Estimated future warranty obligations are included in cost of product sales in the period
in which the related revenue is recognized. The factors affecting the Company s warranty include the number of products currently under warranty, historical and
anticipated rates of warranty claim on those products, and the estimates of repair and replacement costs to satisfy the Company s warranty obligation. The anticipated rate of warranty claims is the primary estimate used in determining the warranty liability and is
relatively predictable using historical experience of failure rates. The average remaining aggregate warranty period of the products sold
is calculated, repair parts are generally already in stock or available at pre-determined prices, and labor rates are generally arranged
at pre-established amount with service providers. If actual results differ from the estimates, the Company revises its estimated warranty
liability. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates and assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the
amounts as necessary. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 
and 
of product warranty were recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, respectively. During the three-month period
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded warranty expenses of 34,314 
and 76,602 ,
respectively. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded warranty expenses of 
and ,902 ,
respectively. 

Contract
liabilities 

The
contract liabilities of the Company are primarily related to advances received from customer. The contract liabilities are reported
in a net position on a customer-by-customer basis at the end of each reporting period. Contract liabilities are recognized when the
Company receives prepayment from customers resulting from purchase order. Contract liabilities will be recognized as revenue when
the products are delivered. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company records contract liabilities of 
and ,
respectively, which will be recognized as revenue upon delivery of the products sold. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, the amounts transferred from contract liabilities to revenue at the beginning of the fiscal period were 
and ,
respectively. 

Disaggregation
of revenues 

The
Company disaggregates its revenue from contracts by products, as the Company believes it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing
and uncertainty of the revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The Company s disaggregation of revenues for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is disclosed in Note 19 of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

and the margin tax in the state of Texas. 

Income
tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of
assets and liabilities computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount
expected to be realized.

NOTE
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

Income
taxes (continued) 

The
Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ASC Topic No.
740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely
than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount
recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not
meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. 

Significant
judgment is also required in evaluating the Company s uncertain income tax positions and provisions for income taxes. Liabilities
for uncertain income tax positions are recognized based on a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate whether an income tax position
has met the recognition threshold by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not to be
sustained upon examination. The second step is to measure the income tax position that has met the recognition threshold as the largest
amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company continually assesses the likelihood and amount of
potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax provisions, income taxes payable and deferred income taxes in the period in which the

As of December 31, 2023, balances of one bank in Massimo Motor Sports exceeded the insured limits by . 

To
limit the exposure to credit risk relating to deposits, the Company primarily places cash deposits with large financial institutions
in the United States. The Company conducts credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral or other security
from them. The Company establishes an accounting policy to provide for current expected credit losses based on the individual customer s
financial condition, credit history, and the current economic conditions. 

b.
Foreign Exchange Risk 

Most
of our raw materials are imported from China. The value of the Chinese Yuan against the U.S. dollar is affected by the changes in China
and United States economic conditions. We do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign exchange risk and have
not used any derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to such risk. 

c.
Interest Rate Risk 

Interest
rate risk is the risk that future cash flows will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. Our exposure to interest
rate risk primarily relates to the interest rates from our lessors and our borrowings with banks. The shareholder loans bear no interest.
Our leasing obligations interest rates are fixed at the commencement date of the leases. We have not been exposed to material
risks due to the fact that our borrowing from the bank is not significant. And we have not used any derivative financial instruments
to manage our interest risk exposure. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be exposed to material risks due to changes
in market interest rate in the future. 

d.
Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity
risk arises through the excess of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time. Our objective in managing
liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet our liquidity requirements at any point in time.
We achieve this by maintaining sufficient cash and banking facilities. 

e.
Significant customers 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, one and one customer accounted for
more than of the Company s total revenues, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, one

Statements . 

Overview
of Company 

Massimo
Group is a holding company established on October 10, 2022 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We, through our subsidiaries, are primarily
engaged in the manufacturing and sales of a wide selection of farm and ranch tested UTVs, recreational ATVs, and Pontoon Boats. Mr. David
Shan, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the controlling shareholder of the Company. 

A
Reorganization of the legal structure was completed on June 1, 2023. The controlling Shareholder transferred his 100 equity interest
in Massimo Motor and 100 equity interest in Massimo Marine to Massimo Group. After this Reorganization, we ultimately own 100 equity
interests of Massimo Motor Sports and Massimo Marine. 

Before
and after the Reorganization, we, together with our subsidiaries, are effectively controlled by the same controlling Shareholder, and
therefore, the Reorganization is considered as a recapitalization of entities under common control in accordance with ASC 805-50-25.
The consolidation of the Company and our subsidiaries have been accounted for at historical cost and prepared on the basis as if the
aforementioned transactions had become effective as of the beginning of the first period presented in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements in accordance with ASC 805-50-45-5. 

We
listed our common stocks on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol MAMO on April 4, 2024 and completed our IPO of 1,300,000
shares of common stock on April 4, 2024, raising approximately 5.0 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting commissions
and the offering expenses payable by us. 

We
currently generate most of our revenues from the sales of UTVs and ATVs, which represented 98.0 and 90.1 of total revenue for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from sales of
UTVs and ATVs represented 96.5 and 87.1 of total revenue, respectively. 

We
also generate revenue from the sales of Pontoon Boats, which represented 2.0 and 9.9 of our revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from the sales of Pontoon Boats represented
3.5 and 12.9 of our revenue, respectively. 

Trends
and Key Factors that Affect Operating Results 

We
believe the most significant factors that affect our business and results of operations include the following: 

Risk
 of intense competition in the industry: The powersports vehicles and boats industry in the United States is highly competitive.
 Competition in such markets is based upon a number of factors, including price, quality, service, reliability, styling, product features
 and warranties. At the dealer level, competition is based on a number of factors including sales and marketing support programs (such
 as financing, joint advertising programs and cooperative advertising). Certain of our competitors are more diversified and have financial
 and marketing resources which are substantially greater than ours, which allow these competitors to invest more heavily in intellectual
 property, product development, and sales and marketing support. Failure to compete effectively with rival products, features, or
 models, or to draw in new dealers, could significantly harm our business, financial condition, or operating results. 
 
 We
 are subject to competitive pricing. Such pricing pressure may limit our ability to maintain prices or to increase prices for our
 products in response to raw material, component and other cost increases and so negatively affect our profit margins. 

1 

Risk
 of economic and policy changes within China: We import our products from various Chinese suppliers. The Chinese government continues
 to play a significant role in regulating industry within China by imposing industrial policies, providing subsidies and heavily regulating
 or prohibiting unwanted activities. There is no assurance the Chinese government will not interfere with the operations of Linhai
 Powersports (with which we have a significant supplier relationship) or any of our other suppliers. In addition, the Chinese government
 has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustments, to control the pace of economic growth in China. These measures,
 or other economic, political, or social developments in China may affect our China-based suppliers, which may adversely affect our
 business and operating results. We also import our products from Taiwan. The Taiwan issue is a longstanding point of contention between
 China and the United States. The U.S. maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan, while also recognizing the One China policy, which
 acknowledges Beijing as the legitimate government of Taiwan. Both China and the U.S. have engaged in military posturing around the
 Taiwan Strait. This increases the risk of accidental clashes or misunderstandings that could escalate into conflict, which will affect
 both our China-mainland-based and Taiwan-based suppliers. 

Risk
 of unavailability of additional capital: We will require significant expenditures to fund future growth. We intend to fund our
 growth out of the proceeds of the IPO and internal sources of liquidity or through additional financing from external sources. Our
 ability to obtain external financing in the future at a reasonable cost is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including our future
 financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the condition of the global and domestic financial markets. If we require
 additional funds and cannot obtain them on acceptable terms when required or at all, we may be unable to fulfill our working capital
 needs, upgrade our existing facilities or expand our business and may have to reduce the level of our operations. These factors may
 also prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business or implementing our future strategies.
 Any debt financing that we undertake may be expensive and might impose covenants that restrict our operations and strategic initiatives,
 including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, make investments
 and engage in mergers, consolidations and asset sale transactions. Equity financings may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially
 dilutive to our shareholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our equity securities may be lower
 than the trading prices of such equities. If new sources of financing are required, but are unattractive, insufficient or unavailable,
 then we could be required to modify our business plans or growth strategy which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
 results of operations or financial condition. 

Risk
 of uncertainty in the cost and production level of raw materials: We depend on third-party suppliers to manufacture many of the
 products we sell, in particular, ATVs and UTVs, as opposed to our recreational boats which we manufacture in our Dallas facility.
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased approximately 62 and 64 of our products from three of these
 suppliers. Competition for the output of these suppliers is intense. If these independent suppliers were unwilling or unable to supply
 us with products at prices which enable us to maintain our gross margins, it would materially adversely affect our business, results
 of operations or financial condition. Although we are looking to broaden our supplier base and to reduce our dependence upon a limited
 number of suppliers, there is no assurance we will be able to do so and increasing the number of suppliers from which we purchase
 products may increase our costs. 

Risk
 related to overseas freights fluctuation: The inflation rate and supply chain crisis experienced in 2021 and 2022 led to a significant
 increase in overseas freight costs. However, by December 31, 2023, there was a notable easing in both inflation and freight costs,
 reflecting an improvement in economic conditions and a stabilization in the supply chain. 

Risk
 related to inflation: In recent years, our China-based suppliers have increased the cost of their products due to inflation.
 We may not be able to pass along price increases in raw materials, parts, or components to customers. As a result, an increase in
 the cost of the raw materials, parts, and components our suppliers use in the manufacture of our products could reduce our profitability
 and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

Risk
 of fluctuations in the sale of Pontoon Boats: A segment of our sales revenue stemming from Massimo Marine exhibits a seasonal
 sales pattern. Boat sales are also influenced by the financing arrangements for boat purchases, which are susceptible to fluctuations
 in interest rates. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our revenue generated from Massimo Marine was
 approximately 2.0 , 3.5 , 9.9 and 12.9 of our total revenue, respectively.

Revenues 

Revenues
decreased by 4.3 million, or 14.4 , from 29.9 million in the third quarter
of fiscal 2023, to 25.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the significant drop
in Pontoon boat sales. The boat category experienced a significant downturn in line with an industry-wide slowdown. This broader trend
is in part influenced by the current high interest rates and inflationary pressures that are impacting on consumer spending, particularly
on the high-ticket but non-essential markets. The boat category fits the profile. Relatedly, the fact that dealers have faced high rejection
rates from floorplan financing providers like Northpoint, has made it challenging for dealers to maintain optimal inventory levels, affecting
our performance in the sales of Pontoon Boats. Additionally, there was a decrease in sales of UTV, ATV and e-bikes. Part of this
decrease is in line with a slow industry-wide trend, while another factor was our seasonal promotions in the third quarter. Some discounted
sales may have affected the performance of our regularly priced items.

Revenue
from sales of UTVs, ATVs and e-bikes 

Revenue
from sales of UTVs, ATVs and e-bikes decreased by 1.9 million, or 6.9 , from 27.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, to 25.1
million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in revenue was partially driven by the slow industry-wide trend, and partially by the
seasonal promotions we offered in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 

Revenue
from sales of Pontoon Boats 

Revenue
from sales of Pontoon Boats decreased by 2.4 million, or 82.5 , from 2.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, to 0.5 million
in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to the significant industry-wide downturn due to the impact of the high interest
rate and the inflation as demonstrated in the high rejection rates dealer have encountered from floorplan financing providers such as Northpoint. This
trend aligns with the industry-wide challenges that intensified in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Additionally, economic uncertainty
in the U.S. has led to reduced spending on luxury boats, further constraining our Pontoon Boat sales. 

Gross
profit 

Our
gross profit decreased by 3.1 million, or 30.9 , from 10.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, to 7.0 million in the
third quarter of fiscal 2024. The gross profit margin was 27.2 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared with 33.6 in the same
period last year. The decrease of 6.5 in the gross profit margin is consistent with (i) reduced sale prices
aimed at clearing slow-moving inventory, and (ii) the decline in sales of Pontoon Boat, without a corresponding reduction
in fixed overhead costs, such as rent and salaries.

The
cost of revenue on UTVs, ATVs and e-bikes increased by 0.6 million, or 3.7 , from 17.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023
to 18.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, and gross profit decreased by 2.5 million, or 26.5 , from 9.4 million in the
third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 6.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The gross margin decreased by 7.4 , from 35.1 in
the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 27.7 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in the cost of revenue was largely due
to higher overhead costs, mainly from research and design input and the additional rent expense as we expand our warehouse space in
fiscal 2024. The decrease in gross margin was primarily a result of selling some inventory at lower price at our seasonal promotions in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 

The
cost of revenue on Pontoon Boats decreased by 1.9 million, or 78.3 , from 2.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 0.5 million
in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, and gross profit decreased by 0.6 million, or 98.9 , from 0.6 million in the third quarter of
fiscal 2023 to 6,619 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The gross margin decreased by 19.1 , from 20.4 in the third quarter of fiscal
2023 to 1.3 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in gross margin was primarily a result of a decline in sales of Pontoon
Boat, without a corresponding reduction in fixed overhead costs, such as rent, utilities, and salaries.

Selling
expenses 

Our
selling expenses mainly include warranty expense, advertising and promotion expense, interest expense incurred for selling products,
shipping and handling fee and merchant service fee. Our selling expenses increased by 0.5 million, or 24.9 , from 2.1 million in the
third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 2.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, representing 10.3 and 7.0 of our total revenue in
the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The increase in selling expenses was mainly due to an increase in shipping
and handling fees, which were approximately 1.5 million and 0.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.
The increase was partly offset by a decrease in warranty expense of approximately 0.4 million, due to enhanced quality control and
customer service measures. The adoption of a traveling technician team has enabled timely responses to customer requests, reducing repair
costs. 

General
and administrative expenses 

Our
general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and benefits, professional fees, office expenses, travel expenses, insurance
expenses, rent expense and depreciation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 1.2 million, or 43.4 , from 2.7
million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 3.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase was mainly due to increased
salaries and benefits, travel expense and rent expense. Our general and administrative expenses represented 15.2 and 9.1 of our total
revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the third quarter of fiscal 2023, respectively. 

Our
salaries and benefits were 1.4 million and 1.1 million, representing 35.2 and 41.6 of our total general and administrative expenses
in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, respectively. The increase in balance was mainly due to
stock-based compensation expense of 0.3 million recognized on RSUs and stock option grant. 

Our
rent expenses increased by 0.3 million or 104.0 , from 0.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 0.6 million in the third
quarter of fiscal 2024, representing 13.9 and 9.8 of our total general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024
and 2023, respectively. This increase was due to two new lease agreements signed in May 2024 and a rent increment following the lease
renewal. 

Our
professional fee increased by 0.1 million or 15.8 , from 0.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 0.8 million in the third
quarter of fiscal 2024, representing 19.4 and 24.0 of our total general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of fiscal
2024 and 2023, respectively. The slight increase was mainly due to public company costs, including audit and investor relation fees. 

Loss on litigation 

During the three
months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a one-time loss of approximate 3.6 million on legal judgment on lawsuit with Nebula.
The Final Judgment on July 8, 2024 awarded Nebula 3.3 million in damages, 1.4 million in attorneys fees and other court cost
and 1.1 million in interest on balances since September 15, 2020. We have recorded an additional accrual of 3.6 million as of September 30,
2024, bringing the total accrual related to this lawsuit to approximately 5.9 million. We have filed the appeal in August
2024. 

Interest
expenses 

Our
interest expense decreased by 149,439 or 69.9 , from 213,901 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 64,462 in the third quarter of
fiscal 2024. The decrease in interest expense was mainly due to a reduction in the average loan balance in third quarter of fiscal 2024
compared with the same period of last year, in response to higher interest rates. We repaid all bank loans in early August 2024. 

Other
income, net 

Our
other income was 210,701 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared with 41,133 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase
of 169,568, or 412.2 . The increase was primarily due to the write-off a long outstanding negative balance of account receivable of
approximately 100,000 and an increase in insurance claim of approximately 100,000 in third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same
period in last year. 

Income
before income taxes 

We
had a decrease of 8.2 million in income before income taxes, from 5.1 million income in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to approximately
 3.1 million loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in gross profit by 3.1
million, an increase of general and administrative expenses of approximately 1.2 million and a loss of legal judgment of approximately
 3.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as well as other expenses as discussed above. 

(Recovery of) provision
for income taxes 

The
income tax recovery was approximately 0.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to 1.1 million expenses in the
same period of fiscal 2023. The change was mainly due to a net loss of 3.1 million before income taxes generated in the third quarter of fiscal 2024
compared to the same period in last year. 

Net
(loss) income 

We
had net loss of 2.5 million and net income of 4.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease
was primarily due to the lower revenues and gross profit as discussed above.

Revenues
increased by 15.7 million, or 20.8 , from 75.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 91.2 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in revenue was primarily due to combined effects of rising demand in the U.S. ATV and UTV
market and our modified sales strategy. In 2024, we continued to expand our distribution network with various retailers to increase our
products market penetration. We strategically focused our efforts on large retail stores in the U.S. (the big box stores that offer their own financing plans, while moving away from retailers that have liberal return policies.

Revenue
from sales of UTVs, ATVs and e-bikes 

Revenue
from sales of UTVs, ATVs and e-bikes increased by 22.2 million, or 33.8 , from 65.8 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 to 88.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in revenue was primarily attributed to the expansion
into more big box stores. This surge is consistent with the increasing ranch/farm-work utilization of UTVs across the 1.89 million farms
in the U.S. with an average size of 464 acres and the new customer s rural lifestyle focus. The increase in sales is also due to
a shift in our sales strategy, focusing mostly on in-store sales to this retail chain store customer, which generally involve larger volumes and no
returns. In addition, sales to this new customer consist of high-turnover inventory products that are of high quality and have a strong
customer reputation. This enhances the efficiency of our capital utilization.

Revenue
from sales of Pontoon Boats 

Revenue from sales of Pontoon
Boats decreased by 6.6 million, or 67.6 , from 9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.1 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. The revenue decrease was primarily due to an industry-wide downturn driven by high interest rates and
inflation, which are impacting the consumption of non-essential goods. In addition, the fact that the dealers have experienced high rejection
rates at the floorplan financing providers such as Northpoint has directly affected the inventory level the dealers maintain and therefore
our sales in this category. This is consistent with the industry-wide trend. The challenging economic environment and economic uncertainty
in the U.S. has led to reduced spending on luxury boats directly impacting the sales of luxury boats such as our yacht. 

Gross
profit 

Our
gross profit increased by 5.1 million, or 21.6 , from 23.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 28.9 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Gross margin was 31.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 31.5 in
the same period last year. Our gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained constant when compared with the same
period in 2023.

of revenue on UTVs, ATVs and e-bikes increased by 16.1 million, or 36.9 , from 43.5 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, to 59.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and gross profit increased by 6.2 million, or 27.9 , from 22.2
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 28.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Gross margin decreased by 1.5 , from 33.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 32.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The
increase in the cost of revenue was in line with the increase in sales. The decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to
reduced sales prices to clear out slow-moving inventory in recent quarter. 

Cost
of revenue on Pontoon Boats decreased by 5.5 million, or 67.5 , from 8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.7
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and gross profit decreased by 1.1 million, or 68.5 , from 1.6 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Gross margin decreased by 0.4 , from
16.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 15.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our gross margin for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 remained constant compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Selling
expenses 

Our
selling expenses mainly include warranty expense, advertising and promotion expense, interest expense, shipping and handling fee and
merchant service fee. These expenses increased by 1.4 million, or 21.3 , from 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
to 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing 8.7 and 8.7 of total revenue in both periods. The increase
was mainly due to higher shipping and handling fees, which rose from approximately 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 to 4.6 million in the same period in 2024, consistent with the increase in sales. The increase was partly offset by a reduction
in warranty expense of approximately 0.5 million, due to enhanced quality control and customer service. The addition of a traveling
technician team has enabled us to respond to customer requests promptly, reducing repair costs. 

7 

General
and administrative expenses 

Our
general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and benefits, professional fees, office expenses, travel expenses, insurance
expenses, rent expense and depreciation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 3.1 million, or 33.8 , from 9.0
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was
mainly due to higher rent expense, salaries and benefit, and insurance expense. Our general and administrative expenses represented 13.3 
and 12.0 of our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Our
salaries and benefits were 4.2 million and 3.3 million, representing 34.8 and 36.1 of our total general and administrative expenses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to 0.5 million severance package
following an employment termination and a 0.6 million stock-based compensation expenses recognized for RSUs and stock option grants. 

Our
rent expenses increased by 0.9 million or 95.6 , from 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.8 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing 14.6 and 10.0 of our total general and administrative expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our rent expense increased because we had two new lease agreements in May 2024
while one lease agreement in May 2023. We also had monthly rent increment upon renewing the lease agreement. Our property taxes included
in the rent expenses also increased by 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year. 

Our
insurance expense increased by 0.6 million or 88.9 , from 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.3 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing 10.7 and 7.6 of our total general and administrative expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was mainly due to a higher general insurance premium year-over-year
in correlation with sales growth, as well as the purchase of directors and officers insurance following our transition to a public company. 

Impairment
loss on supplier deposit 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a one-time impairment loss of approximate 772,780 on advanced deposit to one
supplier. In June 2024, we reached a tentative agreement regarding general settlement terms with one suppler who would pay
approximately 312,500 to resolve the claim. Our prepayment of 1.1 million would be considered irrecoverable. Therefore, we wrote
off the approximate 772,780 of prepayment to the supplier during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The settlement agreement
was finalized in August 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had no impairment loss of
prepayment. 

Loss on litigation 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a one-time loss of approximate 3.6
million on legal judgment on lawsuit with Nebula. The Final Judgment on July 8, 2024 awarded Nebula 3.3 million in damages, 1.4
million in attorneys fees and other court cost and 1.1 million in interest on balances since September 15, 2020. We have
recorded an additional accrual of 3.6 million as of September 30, 2024, bringing the total accrual related to this lawsuit to
approximately 5.9 million. We have filed the appeal in August 2024. 

Interest
expenses 

Our
interest expense decreased by 225,208 or 45.6 , from 494,011 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 268,803 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was mainly due to a lower average loan balance during the nine months ended September 30,
2024, compared to the same period last year, in response to raising interest rates. All bank loans were repaid in early August 2024. 

8 

Other
income, net 

Other
income increased by 477,537, or 422.6 , from 113,001 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 590,538 for the same period
in 2024. The increase was primarily due to the following factors: (i) a 177,147 write-off of a vendor s accounts payable balance
following a settlement with the vendor and us; (ii) a 190,000 write-off of a long outstanding negative balance of account receivable,
both of which contributed to higher other income; and (iii) an additional approximately 100,000 in insurance claims in the third quarter
of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period last year. 

Income before income taxes 

Income before income
taxes decreased by 3.2 million, from 7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to approximately 4.6 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 5.1 million rise in gross profit, partly offset by
an approximately 3.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses and an approximately 3.6 million loss on litigation
and other expenses as discussed above. 

Provision for income taxes 

The income tax expense was
approximately 1.1 million and 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We terminated our S Corporation
status as of June 1, 2023, in connection with the Reorganization and became a taxable C Corporation. Accordingly, the income tax provision
for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 combined both federal income tax of 21 and the state margin tax at Texas as a C Corporation,
and the income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 only reflected state margin tax at Texas as a S Corporation
for five months and a federal income tax of 21 for the remaining four month s operation. 

Net income 

Net income was 3.5 million and 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The decrease was primarily due to higher revenues and gross profit, offset by an increase in general and administrative expense
and a loss on litigation, as discussed above

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was approximately 2.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash
provided by operating activities of approximately 5.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase
in the net cash used in operating activities of 8.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same
period in 2023. This is consistent with the Company using part of the IPO proceeds as working capital to grow sales. The increase is
primarily due to the following: 

Account payable decreased by approximately 2.9 million during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a decrease of approximately 0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
primarily because we paid off undue account payable in the form of Letter of Credit payments from the old bank in order to release the
UCC to the new bank during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Accounts
 receivable increased by approximately 2.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an increase by approximately
 1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the timing difference of payments by customers. 

Inventory
 increased by approximately 5.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an increase by approximately
 0.04 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. It is consistent with the fact that we have been building up our inventory in anticipation of the holiday sales. 

Contract
 liabilities decreased by approximately 0.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an increase by approximately
 0.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
 balance was partly offset by an increase in net income after non-cash item by approximately 1.3 million during the nine months ended
 September 30, 2024 compared with same period in 2023. 

Our
 net income was adjusted for non-cash items, including the write-off of account receivables, non-cash operating lease expense, gain
 (loss) on disposal of fixed asset, impairment loss of asset, stock-based compensation expense, amortization and depreciation, loss
 on litigation, deferred tax expense (recovery) and provision (reversal of allowance) for expected credit loss. Non-cash items of
 approximately 5.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to non-cash items of approximately 1.2 million
 during the same period in 2023. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was approximately 262,163 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used
in investing activities of 68,871 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used investing activities
was primarily attributable to the purchase of property and equipment of 0.4 million, partially offset by a proceed of 0.2 million from
sale of property and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was approximately 3.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
net cash used in financing activities of approximately 5.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in
net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to net proceed
from IPO of 4.5 million and from the common shares subscription of 0.9 million, offset by the repayment of bank loans of 0.3
million and repayment of loan from a related party of 1.5 million . This compares to 2023, when cash used in financing included, a net repayment of bank loan of 1.6 million, the repayment
of 4.0 million to shareholder and payment of IPO related cost. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Overview 

The
general objectives of our capital management strategy reside in the preservation of our capacity to continue operating, in providing
benefits to our stakeholders and in providing an adequate return on investment to our shareholders by selling our products at a price
commensurate with the level of operating risk assumed by us. 

We
thus determine the total amount of capital required consistent with risk levels. This capital structure is adjusted on a timely basis
depending on changes in the economic environment and risks of the underlying assets. We are not subject to any externally imposed capital
requirements. 

10 

Working
Capital 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1.7 million. Our current assets were approximately 45.1
million, including approximately 11.6 million accounts receivable, approximately 30.9 million inventory, approximately 0.3
million advance to suppliers and approximately 0.6 million prepayment and other receivables, and our current liabilities were
approximately 2 6 .3 million, including 9.8 million
accounts payable to suppliers, 3.6 million accrued payment on a legal judgment, 1.2 million contract liabilities, 2.1 million
income tax payable, 6.4 million from a related party and 2.1 million liabilities from obligations under operating and financing
leases, which resulted in a positive working capital of 1 8 .8 million. 

Our
primary source of cash is currently generated from our business and bank borrowings. In the coming years, we will be looking to other
sources, such as raising additional capital by issuing shares of stock, to meet our cash needs. While facing uncertainties regarding
the size and timing of capital raise, we are confident that we can continue to support our operational needs solely by utilizing cash flows
generated from our operating activities organically.

Off-balance
Sheet Commitments and Arrangements 

There
were no off-balance sheet arrangements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, that have, or that in the opinion of management
are likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, each as of the date of the financial statements,
and revenue and expenses during the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates their estimates and assumptions, and
the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our
consolidated financial statements. 

Management
has determined that, while there are no critical accounting estimates, the most significant estimates relate to sales returns, products
warranty, allowance for credit loss, inventory provision, and the assessment and disclosure of contingent liabilities due to on-going
lawsuit. Each of these are discussed below. 

Sales
returns 

We
provide a refund policy to accept returns from end customers, which varies and depends on the different products and customers. The estimated
sales returns are determined based upon an analysis of historical sales returns. Return allowances are recorded as a reduction in sales
with corresponding sales return liabilities which are included in accrued return liabilities. The estimated cost of returned
inventory is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales and an increase of right of return assets which is included in inventories. 
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 163,666 and 283,276 of sales return liabilities associated with estimated product returns
were recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, respectively. During the three-month period ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, the Company recorded sales returns of 317,188 and 223,428 respectively. During the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded sales returns of 824,978 and 1,975,270, respectively. 

12 

Warranty 

We
generally provide a one-year limited warranty against defects in materials related to the sale of products. The Company considers the
warranty as an assurance type warranty since the warranty provides the customer the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon
specifications. Estimated future warranty obligations are included in cost of product sales in the period in which the related revenue
is recognized. The determination of the Company s warranty accrual is based on actual historical experience with the product, estimates
of repair and replacement costs and any product warranty problems that are identified after shipment. The Company estimates and adjusts
these accruals at each balance sheet date in accordance with changes in these factors. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
 608,644 and 619,113 of product warranty were recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, respectively. During the
three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded warranty expenses of 234,314 and 576,602, respectively.
During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded warranty expenses of 1,102,494 and 1,521,902,
respectively. 

Allowance
for credit loss 

We
considered various factors, including nature, historical collection experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances and the contract
assets, credit quality and specific risk characteristics of its customers, current economic conditions, forecasts of future economic
conditions, reversion period, and qualitative and quantitative adjustments to develop an estimate of credit losses. We have adopted loss
rate method to calculate the credit loss and considered the relevant factors of the historical and future conditions of the Company to
make reasonable estimation of the risk rate. For accounts receivable aged less than one year and non-overdue contract assets, we use
the loss rate method, which is a combination of historical rate method and adjustment rate method, to estimate the credit loss. For accounts
receivable aged over one year and overdue retainage receivable, we use the individual specific valuation method to estimate the credit
loss. 

We
wrote off potentially uncollectible accounts receivable against the allowance for credit losses if it is determined that the amounts
will not be collected. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recorded allowance for credit loss of 0.7 million and 0.6 million
in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, respectively. 

Inventory
provision 

We
assessed the net realizable value of each item of inventories and compared to the cost on the book, which include the cost of raw
materials, freight and duty for raw materials, direct labor costs, and the overhead costs for finished goods at the end of each
reporting period. In addition, we assessed all slow-moving or obsolete items for inventory valuation purposes. As of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had inventory provision of 329,900 and 439,900, included in inventories, net in the
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. Reversal of impairment provision of inventories were 110,000, 110,000, nil and
 nil for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, included in cost of revenues in the unaudited
condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. 

Contingencies 

We
may be involved in various legal proceedings, claims and other disputes arising from the commercial operations, projects and other matters
which, in general, are subject to uncertainties and in which the outcome are not predictable. We determine whether an estimated loss
from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. Although we can
give no assurances about the resolution of pending claims, litigation or other disputes and the effect such outcomes may have on us,
we believe that any ultimate liability resulting from the outcome of such proceedings, to the extent not otherwise provided or covered
by insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on the our unaudited condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations
or liquidity as at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, except one litigation discussed below. 

Litigation 

On July 8, 2024, the Company received a final judgment from the trial court
in the lawsuit filed by Taizhou Nebula Power Co, Ltd. Nebula on September 15, 2020. The final judgment awarded Nebula
 3,334,542 in damages, 1,436,809 in attorneys fees and other court costs, and 1,146,169 in interest on balances from September
15, 2020. In connection with this judgment, the Company recorded an additional accrual of 3,573,651 as of September 30, 2024, bringing
the total accrual related to this lawsuit to approximately 5.9 million. The Company filed an appeal in August 2024. 

Although
our significant accounting policies are elaborated upon in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated
financial statements, we maintain that there were no critical accounting policies.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures . 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together,
the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. Specifically, we concluded that our controls over the classification of related party payables, and accounting for
related party notes payable was not effectively designed or maintained. Our management performed additional analysis as deemed necessary
to ensure that our unaudited financial statements included in this Report were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, management
believes that the unaudited financial statements included in this Report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows of the periods presented. 

In
light of the material weakness described above, our management team has performed additional accounting and financial analyses and other
post-closing procedures. We have enhanced, and will continue to enhance, internal controls and procedures, including access to accounting
literature, identification and consideration of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications
and implementing additional layers of reviews in the financial close process. While we have processes to properly identify and evaluate
the appropriate accounting technical pronouncements and other literature for all significant or unusual transactions, we plan to continue
to improve these processes to ensure that the nuances of such transactions are effectively evaluated in the context of the increasingly
complex accounting standards. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than as discussed above, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended
September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1. Legal Proceedings 

We
are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against
us or any of our officers or directors in their corporate capacity.

As

Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024. Any of these factors could result
in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may
also affect our business. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future
filings with the SEC.
