 . The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders,
the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue to develop its business and ultimately on the attainment
of profitable operations. The Company has in the past, and is expected to in the future, arrange additional capital financing that may
assist in addressing these issues; however, these factors continue to raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Solutions, Inc. Quest NV ), a Nevada corporation that is now our wholly owned subsidiary and operating business (the Share
Exchange ). The Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization effected through a share exchange, with Quest NV as the accounting
acquirer and the Company as the accounting acquiree. Our consolidated financial statements are therefore, in substance, those of Quest
NV.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition has been derived from and should be read in conjunction
with our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this quarterly
report, as well as the Presentation of Information section that appears at the beginning of this quarterly report. 

Overview 

We
are an innovative water technology company that provides sustainable and environmentally sound solutions to water-scarce regions. We
use proven technologies to create economically viable products that address the critical shortage of clean drinking water in both domestic
and foreign emerging markets. 

Our
goal is to address the vital issue of water quality and water supply by providing an alternative, sustainable source of pure water at
the smallest possible environmental cost to global areas in need, while becoming a leading company in providing decentralized, turn-key
solutions using alternative energy for the purification, desalination and distribution of clean drinking water. 

We
focus on the manufacture and sale of two products: our AQUAtap TM Community Water Purification and Distribution system and
our WEPS TM (atmospheric Water Extraction and Purification System). Our AQUAtap TM system is an autonomous, decentralized,
self-contained, solar-powered water purification and distribution system, while our WEPS TM is a unique, proprietary water
extraction and purification system that produces clean drinking water from humidity in the atmosphere. 

To
date, we have focused our activities on the formation of safe water partnerships and the sale and installation of our products, with
emphasis on our AQUAtap TM Community Water Purification Distribution systems throughout North America, Latin America,
the Caribbean and Africa, with specific attention to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the DRC ), Angola and South Africa. 

Corporate
History and Background 

We
were incorporated under the laws of Delaware on February 25, 2010. Prior to the Share Exchange, we had minimal revenue and our operations
were limited to capital formation, organization and development of our business plan. As a result of the Share Exchange, we ceased our
prior operations and, through Quest NV, we now operate as an innovative water technology company that provides sustainable and environmentally
sound solutions to water-scarce regions. 

Quest
NV was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on October 20, 2008 and commenced operations on February 20, 2009. Its operations to date
have consisted of business formation, strategic development, marketing, technologies development, negotiations with technologies companies
and capital raising activities. Quest NV has not generated any revenues since its inception. 

4 

Acquisition
of Quest NV 

On
January 6, 2012, we completed the Share Exchange whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Quest NV in exchange
for 2,568,493 shares of our common stock (on a pre-forward split basis), or approximately 62.74 of our issued and outstanding common
stock as of the consummation of the Share Exchange. Subsequent to the Share Exchange, we completed a 20 for 1 forward split of our common
stock (the Forward Split that became effective on March 1, 2012. Pursuant to the Forward Split, the 2,568,493 shares described
above increased to 51,369,860 shares. 

As
a result of the Share Exchange, Quest NV became our wholly owned subsidiary, John Balanko and Peter Miele became our directors, officers
and principal stockholders, and we assumed the business and operations of Quest NV. The Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization
effected through a share exchange, with Quest NV as the accounting acquirer and the Company as the accounting acquiree. 

AQUAtap
Global 

In
July 2021, we incorporated a new operating subsidiary, AQUAtap Global, Inc., a Wyoming corporation AQUAtap ). Through this
entity, we expect to coordinate, facilitate and manage our current, planned and future safe water partnerships throughout Africa, Latin
America and the Caribbean that provide clean water initiatives for underserved communities. AQUAtap, together with its strategic global
partners, plans to establish separate partnerships in each country in which it plans to operate and engage experienced local individuals
and organizations for operational expertise. We anticipate that this will enable these partnerships to enter into public-private partnerships
(commonly known as PPPs) with NGOs, strategic investors and various levels of government. 

Quest
Water Solutions Inc., a British Columbia, Canada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Quest NV Quest BC ), will remain
as the technology provider to our safe water initiatives. Quest BC is responsible for designing, engineering and manufacturing our range
of products, and it also sells these water technology products directly to end users through our corporate sales marketing divisions
and through global distributors and agents. 

Results
of Operations 

For
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 

Revenue 

We
did not generate any revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. We anticipate that we will incur substantial losses
for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate any revenues in the next 12 months continues to be uncertain. 

Expenses 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 137,329 in total expenses, including 123,750 in management fees, 6,076 in professional
fees, 3,864 in transfer agent and filing fees, 1,921 in office and miscellaneous expenses, 859 in automotive expenses, 734 in telephone
expenses and 125 in depreciation. During the same period in the prior year, we incurred 140,498 in total expenses, including 123,750
in management fees, 5,250 in rent, 3,574 in transfer agent and filing fees, 3,209 in professional fees, 2,212 in automotive expenses,
 1,554 in office and miscellaneous expenses, 824 in telephone expenses and 125 in depreciation. Our expenses were therefore relatively
consistent between the two periods. 

5 

Net
Loss 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 137,329, whereas we incurred a net loss of 140,498 during the
same period in the prior year. Our net loss per share during each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.001. 

For
the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 

Revenue 

We
did not generate any revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. As described above, we anticipate that we will
incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate any revenues in the next 12 months continues to be uncertain. 

Expenses 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 610,054 in total expenses, including 371,250 in management fees, 187,355 in
consulting fees, 28,382 in professional fees, 14,210 in transfer agent and filing fees, 3,679 in office and miscellaneous expenses,
 2,551 in automotive expenses, 2,252 in telephone expenses and 375 in depreciation. During the same period in the prior year, we incurred
 433,939 in total expenses, including 371,250 in management fees, 16,772 in professional fees, 15,570 in rent, 14,744 in transfer
agent and filing fees, 6,819 in automotive expenses, 5,668 in office and miscellaneous expenses, 2,561 in telephone expenses and 375
in depreciation. 

Except
for the significant consulting fees we incurred during the current year, which was entirely attributable to the granting of an aggregate
of 3,750,000 options which vested during the first quarter, and an increase in our professional fees that was associated with having
our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 re-audited, our expenses were relatively consistent between the two periods. 

Net
Loss 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 610,054 and a net loss per share of 0.005, whereas we incurred
a net loss of 433,939 and a net loss per share of 0.003 during the same period in the prior year. The increase was substantially attributable
to the increase in our stock-based compensation expense from period-to-period as described above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024 we had 12 in cash, 5,486 in total assets, 2,263,089 in total liabilities and a working capital deficiency of
 2,257,895. As of that date, we also had an accumulated deficit of 12,445,439. 

To
date, we have experienced negative cash flows from operations and we have been dependent on sales of our common stock and capital contributions
to fund our operations. We expect this situation to continue for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate that we will experience negative
cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2024. 

6 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 438,019 in net cash on operating activities, compared to 431,838 in net cash used
on operating activities during the same period in the prior year. Our net cash spending on operating activities during the two fiscal
years was therefore reasonably consistent. 

We
did not use any net cash on investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 

We
received 438,028 in net cash from financing activities during the nine months ended September
30, 2024, all of which was in the form of advances from related parties. During the same period in the prior year, we received 431,880
in net cash from financing activities, all of which was also in the form of advances from related parties. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash decreased by 12 as a result of our operating activities. As of September 30, 2024,
we did not have sufficient cash resources to meet our operating expenses for the next month based on our then-current burn rate. 

Plan
of Operations 

Our
plan of operations over the next 12 months is to continue to address water quality and supply issues in the DRC through the installation
of our AQUAtap TM Community Water Purification Distribution systems as well as the employment of our WEPS TM 
technology, and we anticipate that we will require a minimum of 990,000 to pursue those plans. 

We
intend to meet the balance of our cash requirements for the next 12 months through advances from related parties as well as a combination
of debt financing and equity financing through private placements as circumstances allow. We are presently in the process of contacting
broker/dealers in Canada and elsewhere regarding possible financing arrangements. There is no assurance that we will be successful in
completing any private placement or other financings. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient funds through our capital raising
efforts, we may review other financing options. 

During
the next 12 months, we estimate that our planned expenditures will include the following:

 Equipment purchases 
 250,000 
 
 Management fees

Going
Concern 

Our
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies we will continue to realize our assets and discharge
our liabilities in the normal course of business. As at September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficiency of 2,257,895 and an
accumulated deficit of 12,445,439. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from our creditors,
our ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and ultimately on the attainment of profitable operations. These
factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we
be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that is material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

We
have identified certain accounting policies, described below, that are important to the portrayal of our current financial condition
and results of operations. 

Basis
of Presentation and Consolidation 

The
Company s condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, and are expressed in US dollars. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company; the Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries Quest Water Solutions, Inc., a company incorporated under the
laws of the State of Nevada Quest Nevada ), and AQUAtap Global, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the State
of Wyoming; and Quest Nevada s wholly owned subsidiary, Quest Water Solutions Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the
province of British Columbia, Canada. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. 

8 

Foreign
Currency Translation 

The
Company s functional currency is US dollars. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the currency of measurement
at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction date. Monetary balance sheet items expressed in foreign currencies are translated
into US dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in
income. 

The
Company s integrated foreign subsidiaries are financially or operationally dependent on the Company. The Company uses the temporal
method to translate the accounts of its integrated operations into US dollars. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the
exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates. Revenues
and expenses are translated at average rates for the period, except for amortization, which is translated on the same basis as the related
asset. The resulting exchange gains or losses are recognized in income. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not
required. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules
and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer,
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, management concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to certain deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) during the period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

II OTHER INFORMATION

of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency,
self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of our executive officers or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against
or affecting us, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or our officers or directors of those of our subsidiaries in their
capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect.
