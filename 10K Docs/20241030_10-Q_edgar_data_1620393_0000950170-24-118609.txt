Cautionary Statement Regardin g Forward-Looking Statements 
 This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements relating to our liquidity and capital resources, the performance of our properties and results of operations contain forward-looking statements. Furthermore, all of the statements regarding future financial performance (including market conditions and demographics) are forward-looking statements. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements presented in this quarterly report are based on management s current beliefs and assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, expect, intend, may, might, plan, estimate, project, should, will, would, result and similar expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. 
 Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. 
 Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, liquidity or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: 
 unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions in the United States and globally and in the specific markets where our properties are located; 

macroeconomic trends including inflation and high interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations; 

risks associated with the ownership of real estate; 

limited ability to dispose of assets because of the relative illiquidity of real estate investments; 

our multifamily properties are concentrated in certain geographic markets in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States, which makes us more susceptible to adverse developments in those markets; 

increased risks associated with our strategy of acquiring value-enhancement multifamily properties rather than more conservative investment strategies; 

failure to succeed in new markets may have adverse consequences on our performance; 

potential reforms to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac and the Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae 

competition could limit our ability to acquire attractive investment opportunities, which could adversely affect our profitability and impede our growth; 

competition and any increased affordability of residential homes could limit our ability to lease our apartments or increase or maintain rents; 

the relatively low residential mortgage rates may result in potential renters purchasing residences rather than leasing them, and as a result, cause a decline in our occupancy rates; 

the risk that we may fail to consummate future property acquisitions; 

failure of acquisitions to yield anticipated results; 

risks associated with increases in interest rates and our ability to issue additional debt or equity securities in the future; 

risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility; 

contingent or unknown liabilities related to properties or businesses that we have acquired or may acquire; 

lack of or insufficient amounts of insurance; 

the risk that our environmental assessments may not identify all potential environmental liabilities and our remediation actions may be insufficient; 

high costs associated with the investigation or remediation of environmental contamination, including asbestos, lead-based paint, chemical vapor, subsurface contamination and mold growth; 

high costs associated with the compliance with various accessibility, environmental, building and health and safety laws and regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Fair Housing Act; 

risks associated with limited warranties we may obtain when purchasing properties; 

ii 

exposure to decreases in market rents due to our short-term leases; 

risks associated with operating through joint ventures and funds; 

our dependence on information systems; 

risks associated with breaches of our data security; 

costs associated with being a public company, including compliance with securities laws; 

the risk that our business could be adversely impacted if there are deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting; 

risks associated with our substantial current indebtedness and indebtedness we may incur in the future; 

risks associated with derivatives or hedging activity; 

risks associated with representations and warranties made by us in connection with sales of our properties may subject us to liability that could result in losses and could harm our operating results and, therefore, distributions we make to our stockholders; 

loss of key personnel of NexPoint Advisors, L.P. (our Sponsor ), NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P. (our Adviser and our property manager; 

the risk that we may not replicate the historical results achieved by other entities managed or sponsored by affiliates of our Adviser, members of our Adviser s management team or by our Sponsor or its affiliates; 

risks associated with our Adviser s ability to terminate the Advisory Agreement (as defined below); 

our ability to change our major policies, operations and targeted investments without stockholder consent; 

the substantial fees and expenses we pay to our Adviser and its affiliates; 

risks associated with any potential internalization of our management functions; 

conflicts of interest and competing demands for time faced by our Adviser, our Sponsor and their officers and employees; 

the risk that we may compete with other entities affiliated with our Sponsor or property manager for properties and residents; 

failure to maintain our status as a REIT; 

failure of our operating partnership to be taxable as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, possibly causing us to fail to qualify for or to maintain REIT status; 

compliance with REIT requirements, which may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, liquidate certain of our investments or incur tax liabilities; 

risks associated with our ownership of interests in taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"); 

the recognition of taxable gains from the sale of properties as a result of the inability to complete certain like-kind exchanges in accordance with Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code 

the risk that the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") may consider certain sales of properties to be prohibited transactions, resulting in a 100 penalty tax on any taxable gain; 

the risk that we may be subject to other tax liabilities that may reduce our cash flows and distributions on our shares; 

the ineligibility of dividends payable by REITs for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends; 

risks associated with the stock ownership restrictions of the Code for REITs and the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter; 

the ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval; 

recent and potential legislative or regulatory tax changes or other actions affecting REITs; 

foreign investors may be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax distributions received from us or on proceeds and the disposition of our current common stock; 

risks associated with the market for our common stock and the general volatility of the capital and credit markets; 

failure to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding indebtedness or pay distributions at expected levels; 

risks associated with limitations of liability for and our indemnification of our directors and officers; 

the risk that legal proceedings we become involved in from time to time could adversely affect our business; 

iii 

the risk that acts of violence could decrease the value of our assets and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations; 

risks associated with the Highland Capital Management, L.P. bankruptcy, including related litigation and potential conflicts of interest; and 

any other risks included under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2024 or under Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. They are based on estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this quarterly report. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, data or methods, future events or other changes, except as required by law.

 , and has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust REIT and the Company believes the current organization and method of operation will enable it to maintain its status as a REIT. The Company is focused on value-add multifamily investments primarily located in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. Substantially all of the Company s business is conducted through NexPoint Residential Trust Operating Partnership, L.P. (the OP ), the Company s operating partnership. The Company also consolidates certain variable interest entities ("VIEs") in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board s ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 810 Consolidation. The Company controls and consolidates the OP as a VIE. The Company owns its properties (the Portfolio through the OP and its wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary TRS ).

Insurance proceeds received from casualty losses are recognized on the Company s consolidated statements of cash flows as investing activities. The Company differentiates proceeds received from business interruption and casualty gains (losses) in accounting for the transactions. Business interruption proceeds are specifically insurance proceeds to recoup lost rents due to a qualifying event(s) (i.e., fires, floods, storms, water damage, etc.) as determined by the insurance policy and are reflected as operating cash flows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. Business interruption that has been accrued by the Company is presented in miscellaneous income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Casualty gains (losses) are distinctly attributable to damage and subsequent write down of the property (loss), and the recoupment of funds from the insurance policy, as it relates to the damage. Such proceeds received from the damage to the property are accounted for as a gain to the Company, and potentially offset losses attributable to net write off of damaged assets.

Other Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the OP have a redemption feature and are marked to their redemption value if such value exceeds the carrying value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests in the OP (see Note 8). The redemption value is based on the fair value of the Company s common stock at the redemption date, and therefore, is calculated based on the fair value of the Company s common stock at the balance sheet date. Since the valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, redeemable noncontrolling interests in the OP are classified as Level 2 if they are adjusted to their redemption value. Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaid and other assets, excluding interest rate caps, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, accrued real estate taxes payable, accrued interest payable, security deposits and prepaid rent approximated their carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The estimated fair values of other financial instruments were determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize on the disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected, forecasted, or expected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this report, and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report. 
 Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Portfolio consisted of 36 multifamily properties primarily located in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States encompassing 13,174 units of apartment space that was approximately 94.8 leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of 1,500. Substantially all of our business is conducted through the OP. We own the Portfolio through the OP and our TRS. The OP owns approximately 99.9 of the Portfolio; our TRS owns approximately 0.1 of the Portfolio. The OP GP is the sole general partner of the OP. As of September 30, 2024, there were 26,053,988 OP Units outstanding, of which 25,951,154, or 99.6 , were owned by us, and 102,834, or 0.4 , were owned by an unaffiliated limited partner (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements). 
 We are primarily focused on directly or indirectly acquiring, owning, and operating well-located multifamily properties with a value-add component in large cities and suburban submarkets of large cities, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. We generate revenue primarily by leasing our multifamily properties. We intend to employ targeted management and a value-add program at a majority of our properties in an attempt to improve rental rates and the net operating income NOI at our properties and achieve long-term capital appreciation for our stockholders. We are externally managed by the Adviser through the Advisory Agreement, by and among the OP, the Adviser and us. The Advisory Agreement was renewed on February 26, 2024 for a one-year term. The Adviser is wholly owned by NexPoint Advisors, L.P. 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, and expect to continue to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85 of our ordinary income, (2) 95 of our capital gain net income and (3) 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. We believe we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The macroeconomic environment remains challenging as central banks have continued to rapidly raise interest rates. The rising rate environment, coupled with large bank failures in early 2023 and ongoing economic uncertainty, has limited credit availability to commercial real estate. Less available and more expensive debt capital has had pronounced effects on the capital markets, making property acquisitions and other investments harder to finance. Similar factors also impact the timing of and proceeds generated from asset sales and our ability to obtain debt capital. 
 On October 16, 2019, Highland, a former affiliate of our Sponsor, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Highland Bankruptcy ). On October 15, 2021, Marc S. Kirschner, as litigation trustee of a litigation subtrust formed pursuant to Highland s plan of reorganization and disclosure statement which became effective on August 11, 2021, filed a lawsuit (the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit against various persons and entities, including our Sponsor and James Dondero. On March 24, 2023, the litigation trustee filed a motion for leave to stay the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit, which was granted by the bankruptcy court on April 4, 2023. Per the court s order, the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit is stayed until any party provides 30 days notice of the intent to resume the adversary proceeding, with all pending deadlines extended for a period of time commensurate with the length of the stay. As of the date of this filing, the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit continues to be stayed. In addition, on February 8, 2023, UBS Securities LLC and its affiliate (collectively, UBS filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York against Mr. Dondero and a number of other persons and entities seeking to collect on 1.3 billion in judgments UBS obtained against entities that were managed indirectly by Highland (the UBS Lawsuit ). Neither the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit nor the UBS Lawsuit include claims related to our business or our assets. Our Sponsor and Mr. Dondero have informed us they believe the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit has no merit, and Mr. Dondero has informed us he believes the UBS Lawsuit has no merit; we have been advised that the defendants named in each of the lawsuits intend to vigorously defend against the claims. We do not expect the Bankruptcy Trust Lawsuit or the UBS Lawsuit will have a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

The Expense Cap does not limit the reimbursement by us of expenses related to securities offerings paid by our Adviser. The Expense Cap also does not apply to legal, accounting, financial, due diligence, and other service fees incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions, extraordinary litigation, or other events outside our ordinary course of business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of real estate assets. Additionally, in the sole discretion of the Adviser, the Adviser may elect to waive certain advisory and administrative fees otherwise due. If advisory and administrative fees are waived in a period, the waived fees for that period are considered to be waived permanently and the Adviser may not be reimbursed in the future. 
 Property general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing, professional fees, general office supplies, and other administrative related costs of each property. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs primarily include depreciation of our multifamily properties and amortization of acquired in-place leases.

The change in our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to our net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily relates to the change in gain on sales of real estate of 43.1 million. 
 Revenues 
 Rental income . Rental income was 62.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 67.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 5.6 million.

The increase between periods was primarily due to an increase in casualty-related expenses of 1.4 million, partially offset by decreases in all other operating expenses of 1.0 million. The decrease in all other operating expenses of 1.0 million was primarily attributable to our disposition activity in 2023 and 2024. 
 Real estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were 8.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 0.7 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to disposition activity in 2023 and 2024 and the timing of the transactions. 
 Property management fees. Property management fees were 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 which was a decrease of 0.2 million. Property management fees are primarily based on total revenues. 
 24

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our Adviser elected to voluntarily waive the advisory and administrative fees of approximately 5.3 million and 5.5 million and are considered permanently waived. Our Adviser is not contractually obligated to waive fees on New Assets in the future and may cease waiving fees on New Assets at its discretion. Advisory and administrative fees may increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties, which will be classified as New Assets. 
 Corporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses were 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 0.1 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to disposition activity in 2023 and 2024. 
 Property general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses were 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of 0.9 million.

 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs were 24.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 0.8 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense of approximately 0.8 million, which was primarily due to our value-add activities in 2023 and 2024. 
 Other Income and Expense 
 Interest expense. Interest expense was 14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 3.0 million. The decrease in interest expense between the periods is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest on debt of approximately 3.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in effective interest rate swap expense of 0.7 million. The following table details the various costs included in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

 Revenues 
 Rental income . Rental income was 190.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 203.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 12.9 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to our disposition activity in 2023 and 2024. 
 Other income. Other income was 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 0.2 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to an increase in interest income. 
 Expenses 
 Property operating expenses. Property operating expenses were 43.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 44.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 0.9 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to our disposition activity in 2024 and the last half of 2023. 
 26 

Real estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were 25.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 28.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 2.6 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to our disposition activity in 2024 and the last half of 2023.

Advisory and administrative fees were 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which was a decrease of approximately 0.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our Adviser elected to voluntarily waive the advisory and administrative fees of approximately 16.0 million and 16.2 million and are considered permanently waived. Our Adviser is not contractually obligated to waive fees on New Assets in the future and may cease waiving fees on New Assets at its discretion. Advisory and administrative fees may increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties, which will be classified as New Assets. 
 Corporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses were 14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 1.6 million.

Casualty (loss) . Casualty loss was 0.5 million compared to a 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in casualty loss between periods of 0.5 million is attributable to the Company's casualty events and the timing. 
 Miscellaneous income. Miscellaneous income was 0.3 million compared to 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease between periods is attributable to a decrease in business interruption proceeds. 
 Gain on sale of real estate. Gain on sale of real estate was 50.4 million compared to 43.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase between periods is attributable to our two dispositions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to one during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Non-GAAP Measurements 
 Net Operating Income and Same Store Net Operating Income 
 NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties to other comparable properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as NOI is calculated by adjusting net income (loss) to add back (1) interest expense, (2) advisory and administrative fees, (3) depreciation and amortization expenses, (4) gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, (5) corporate income and corporate general and administrative expenses that are not reflective of operations of the properties, (6) other gains and losses that are specific to us including gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and modification costs, (7) casualty-related expenses/(recoveries) and casualty gains (losses), (8) gain on forfeited deposits, (9) property general and administrative expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on behalf of the Company at the property for expenses such as legal, professional, centralized leasing service and franchise tax fees and (10) equity in earnings of affiliates. 
 The cost of funds is eliminated from net income (loss) because it is specific to our particular financing capabilities and constraints. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital, which may have changed or may change in the future. Corporate general and administrative expenses, and non-operating fees to affiliates and equity in earnings of affiliates are eliminated because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our multifamily properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale, which will usually change from period to period. Casualty-related expenses and recoveries are excluded because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. Entity level general and administrative expenses incurred at the properties are eliminated as they are specific to the way in which we have chosen to hold our properties and are the result of our ownership structuring. Gain on forfeited deposits is excluded as it does not reflect the ongoing operations of the properties. Corporate income is excluded as it does not pertain to the performance of the operating properties. Also, expenses that are incurred upon acquisition of a property do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these items from net income (loss) is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual ongoing revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. 
 However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes corporate general and administrative expenses, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs, certain fees to affiliates such as advisory and administrative fees, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as determined under GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income, which further limits its usefulness. 
 28 

NOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in Results of Operations regarding the components of net income (loss) that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do. 
 We define Same Store NOI as NOI for our properties that are comparable between periods. We view Same Store NOI as an important measure of the operating performance of our properties because it allows us to compare operating results of properties owned for the entirety of the current and comparable periods and therefore eliminates variations caused by acquisitions or dispositions during the periods.

 Q3 Same Store Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Q3 Same Store properties were approximately 94.9 leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of 1,502. As of September 30, 2023, our Q3 Same Store properties were approximately 93.9 leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of 1,529. For our Q3 Same Store properties, we recorded the following operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Revenues 
 Rental income . Rental income was 61.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 60.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 1.2 million, or 2.0 . The increase is attributable to an increase in weighted average occupancy during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other income. Other income was 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of 0.2 million. The majority of the decrease is related to a 0.1 million decrease in cable income. 
 Expenses 
 Property operating expenses. Property operating expenses were 14.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of 1.3 million, or 10.1 . The majority of the increase is related to repairs and maintenance and utilities increases of 0.1 million and 0.1 million, respectively. 
 Real estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were 8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which is an increase of 0.3 million. The increase between periods was primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes of 0.3 million.

 Same Store Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Same Store properties were approximately 94.9 leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of 1,502. As of September 30, 2023, our Same Store properties were approximately 93.9 leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of 1,529.

The increase in rental income between the periods was primarily attributable to an increase in weighted average occupancy for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other income. Other income was 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 0.3 million, or 6.4 .

FFO, Core FFO and AFFO 
 We believe that net income (loss), as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. We also believe that funds from operations FFO ), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), core funds from operations Core FFO and adjusted funds from operations AFFO are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. 
 Since the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income (loss), as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization. We compute FFO attributable to common stockholders in accordance with NAREIT s definition. Our presentation differs slightly in that we begin with net income (loss) before adjusting for amounts attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the OP and we show the combined amounts attributable to such noncontrolling interests as an adjustment to arrive at FFO attributable to common stockholders. 
 Core FFO makes certain adjustments to FFO, which are not representative of the ongoing operating performance of our Portfolio. Core FFO adjusts FFO to remove items such casualty-related expenses and recoveries and gains or losses, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and modification costs that are not reflective of continuing operations of the properties, gain on forfeited deposits, the amortization of deferred financing costs, mark-to-market gains or losses related to interest rate cap agreements not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and the noncontrolling interests (as described above) related to these items. We believe Core FFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and is useful in comparing our operating performance with other REITs that are not as involved in the aforementioned activities. Starting in the third quarter of 2024, the Company has adjusted Core FFO to remove (1) the amortization of all deferred financing costs instead of those solely related to short-term debt financing and (2) mark-to-market gains or losses related to interest rate cap agreements not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation. 
 AFFO makes certain adjustments to Core FFO in order to arrive at a more refined measure of the operating performance of our Portfolio. There is no industry standard definition of AFFO and practice is divergent across the industry. AFFO adjusts Core FFO to remove equity-based compensation expense , and the related noncontrolling interests (as described above). We believe AFFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and is useful in comparing our operating performance with other REITs that are not as involved in the aforementioned activities. 
 The effect of the conversion of OP Units held by noncontrolling limited partners is not reflected in the computation of basic and diluted FFO, Core FFO and AFFO per share, as they are exchangeable for common stock on a one-for-one basis. The FFO, Core FFO and AFFO allocable to such units is allocated on this same basis and reflected in the adjustments for noncontrolling interests in the table below. As such, the assumed conversion of these units would have no net impact on the determination of diluted FFO, Core FFO and AFFO per share. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 We believe that the use of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. While FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income (loss) as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO, Core FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO, Core FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define Core FFO or AFFO differently than we do.

The three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 FFO was 15.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of approximately 1.2 million. The change in our FFO between the periods primarily relates to a decrease in total revenues of 5.7 million, offset by decreases in interest expense, loss on extinguishment and property general and administrative expenses of 3.0, 2.2 million and 0.9 million, respectively. 
 Core FFO was 17.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 18.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of 0.2 million. The change in Core FFO was attributable to an increase in FFO and an increase in casualty-related expenses of 1.3 million offset by decreases in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs and mark-to-market adjustments related to interest rate caps of 2.2 million and 0.3 million, respectively. 
 AFFO was 20.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was flat. 
 The nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 FFO was 50.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 53.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 2.8 million. The change in our FFO between the periods primarily relates to a decrease in total revenues of 12.7 million, offset by a decrease in interest expense, real estate taxes and insurance, and loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs of 5.9 million, 2.6 million, and 1.3 million, respectively. 
 Core FFO was 55.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 56.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 1.3 million. The change in our Core FFO between the periods primarily relates to a decrease in FFO and a decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs of 1.3 million, partially offset by increases in casualty-related expenses of 3.0 million. 
 AFFO was 63.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 63.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was a decrease of approximately 0.5 million. The change in our AFFO between the periods primarily relates to a decrease in Core FFO partially offset by an increase of equity-based compensation expense of 0.9 million. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for debt maturities, operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our multifamily properties, including: 
 capital expenditures to continue our value-add program and to improve the quality and performance of our multifamily properties; 

interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness (see Obligations and Commitments below); 

recurring maintenance necessary to maintain our multifamily properties; 

distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT; 

acquisition of additional properties; 

advisory and administrative fees payable to our Adviser; 

general and administrative expenses; 

reimbursements to our Adviser; and 

property management fees payable to BH. 

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and existing cash balances and any unused capacity on the Corporate Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 3.5 million of renovation value-add reserves for our planned capital expenditures to implement our value-add program. Renovation value-add reserves are not required to be held in escrow by a third party. We may reallocate these funds, at our discretion, to pursue other investment opportunities or meet our short-term liquidity requirements. 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional multifamily properties, renovations and other capital expenditures to improve our multifamily properties and scheduled debt payments and distributions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, which may include a revolving credit facility and future debt or equity issuances, existing working capital, net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings, and property dispositions. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including the state of overall equity and credit markets, our 
 36 

degree of leverage, our unencumbered asset base and borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders (including as a result of any failure to comply with financial covenants in our existing and future indebtedness), general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance and liquidity, market perceptions about us and restrictions on sales of properties under the Code. The success of our business strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to access these various capital sources. 
 In addition to our value-add program, our multifamily properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. Also, acquisitions, redevelopments, or expansions of our multifamily properties will require significant capital outlays. Long-term, we may not be able to fund such capital improvements solely from net cash provided by operations because we must distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deductions for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, and we are subject to tax on any retained income and gains. As a result, our ability to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, or redevelopment through retained earnings long-term is limited. Consequently, we expect to rely heavily upon the availability of debt or equity capital for these purposes. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital on favorable terms, or at all, our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 
 On March 4, 2020, the Company, the OP and the Adviser entered into separate equity distribution agreements with each of the ATM Sales Agents, pursuant to which the Company could issue and sell from time to time when an effective registration statement was available shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share, having an aggregate sales price of up to 225,000,000 (the 2020 ATM Program ). The 2020 ATM Program may be terminated by the Company at any time and expires automatically once aggregate sales under the 2020 ATM Program reach 225,000,000 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements). 
 We believe that our available cash, expected operating cash flows, and potential debt or equity financings will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated scheduled debt service payments and dividend requirements for the twelve-month period following September 30, 2024. 
 Cash Flows

Cash flows from operating activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 67.1 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 81.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to decreases in operating liabilities and real estate taxes payable of 9.9 million and 6.0 million, respectively. 
 Cash flows from investing activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 114.7 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 18.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash flows from investing activities was mainly due to two dispositions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to one dispositions during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and a decrease in additions to real estate investments. 
 Cash flows from financing activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 166.4 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 101.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash flows from financing activities was mainly due to a net decrease in net debt of approximately 47.2 million and stock repurchases of 14.6 million.

(1) Average effective monthly rent per unit is equal to the average of the contractual rent for commenced leases as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, minus any tenant concessions over the term of the lease, divided by the number of units under commenced leases as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

(2) Percent occupied is calculated as the number of units occupied as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, divided by the total number of units, expressed as a percentage. 

(3) Includes 36 down units due to casualty events as of September 30, 2024 (see Note 3). 

(4) Property classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. 

Debt, Derivatives and Hedging Activity 
 Mortgage Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, our subsidiaries had aggregate mortgage debt outstanding to third parties of approximately 1.5 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 6.720 and an adjusted weighted average interest rate of 3.58 . For purposes of calculating the adjusted weighted average interest rate of our mortgage debt outstanding, we have included the weighted average fixed rate of 0.98 Adjusted SOFR on our combined 1.1 billion notional amount of interest rate swap agreements, which effectively fixes the interest rate on 1.1 billion of our floating rate debt. See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 We have entered into and expect to continue to enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements with various third parties to fix or cap the floating interest rates on a majority of our floating rate mortgage debt outstanding. The interest rate swap agreements generally have a term of four to five years and effectively establish a fixed interest rate on debt on the underlying notional amounts. The interest rate swap agreements involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. As of September 30, 2024, interest rate swap agreements effectively covered 75 of our 1.4 billion of floating rate debt outstanding. 
 38 

The interest rate cap agreements generally have a term of three to four years, cover the outstanding principal amount of the underlying debt and are generally required by our lenders. Under the interest rate cap agreements, we pay a fixed fee in exchange for the counterparty to pay any interest above a maximum rate. As of September 30, 2024, interest rate cap agreements covered 2.1 billion of our 1.4 billion of floating rate mortgage debt outstanding. These interest rate cap agreements effectively cap SOFR on 2.1 billion of our floating rate mortgage debt at a weighted average rate of 6.87 . 
 LIBOR ceased publication on June 30, 2023. On July 1, 2023, LIBOR rates were replaced with SOFR as the reference rate for most LIBOR debt and derivative instruments. For the Company's interest rate swaps, the reference transitioned from one-month LIBOR to Adjusted SOFR. 
 We intend to invest in additional multifamily properties as suitable opportunities arise and adequate sources of equity and debt financing are available. We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, future borrowings and the proceeds from additional issuances of common stock or other securities or property dispositions. 
 Although we expect to be subject to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we expect that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes, if needed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing common stock or other debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. 
 Furthermore, following the completion of our value-add and capital expenditures programs and depending on the interest rate environment at the applicable time, we may seek to refinance our floating rate debt into longer-term fixed rate debt at lower leverage levels. 
 Corporate Credit Facility 
 
 On March 25, 2022, the Company entered into a loan modification agreement by and among the Company, the OP, Truist Bank and the Lenders party thereto, which modified the Company s existing credit agreement, dated as of June 30, 2021 (as amended and supplemented, the Corporate Credit Facility ). As of September 30, 2024, there was 350.0 million available for borrowing under the Corporate Credit Facility. Subject to conditions provided in the Corporate Credit Facility, the commitments under the Corporate Credit Facility may be increased up to an additional 150.0 million if the lenders agree to increase their commitments or if the lenders agree for the increase to be funded by any additional lender proposed by the Company, through the OP. The Corporate Credit Facility will mature on June 30, 2025 with respect to the revolving commitments, unless the Company exercises its option to voluntarily and permanently reduce all of the revolving commitments before the maturity date or elects to exercise its right and option to extend the facility with respect to the revolving commitments for a single one-year term. As of September 30, 2024, there was 0.0 million in aggregate principal outstanding under the Corporate Credit Facility. 
 
 The Corporate Credit Facility is a non-recourse obligation and contains customary events of default, including defaults in the payment of principal or interest, defaults in compliance with the covenants contained in the document evidencing the loan, defaults in payments under any other security instrument, and bankruptcy or other insolvency events. As of September 30, 2024, the Company believes it is compliant with all provisions. For additional information regarding our Corporate Credit Facility, see Note 4. 
 Interest Rate Swap Agreements 
 In order to fix a portion of, and mitigate the risk associated with, our floating rate indebtedness (without incurring substantial prepayment penalties or defeasance costs typically associated with fixed rate indebtedness when repaid early or refinanced), we, through the OP, have entered into six interest rate swap transactions with KeyBank and four with SunTrust Bank (collectively the Counterparties with a combined notional amount of 1.1 billion. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate swaps we have entered into effectively replace the floating interest rate (SOFR) with respect to 1.1 billion of our floating rate debt outstanding with a weighted average fixed rate of 0.98 . During the term of these interest rate swap agreements, we are required to make monthly fixed rate payments of 0.98 , on a weighted average basis, on the notional amounts, while the Counterparties are obligated to make monthly floating rate payments based on Adjusted SOFR to us referencing the same notional amounts. For purposes of hedge accounting under FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, we have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Obligations and Commitments 
 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2024 for the next five calendar years subsequent to September 30, 2024. We used Adjusted SOFR as of September 30, 2024 to calculate interest expense due by period on our floating rate debt and net interest expense due by period on our interest rate swaps.

As of September 30, 2024, we had entered into eight interest rate swap transactions with a combined notional amount of 1.1 billion. We have allocated the total impact of expected settlements on the 1.1 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps to Operating Properties Mortgage Debt. We used Adjusted SOFR as of September 30, 2024 to determine our expected settlements through the terms of the interest rate swaps. 

Corporate Credit Facility 
 
 The Corporate Credit Facility will mature on June 30, 2025 with respect to the revolving commitments, unless the Company exercises its option to voluntarily and permanently reduce all of the revolving commitments before the maturity date. 
 
 Advisory Agreement 
 
 Our Advisory Agreement requires that we pay our Adviser an annual advisory and administrative fee of 1.2 . The advisory and administrative fees paid to the Adviser on the Contributed Assets (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) are subject to an annual cap of approximately 5.4 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred advisory and administrative fees of 1.7 million and 2.0 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, advisory and administrative fees were 5.2 million and 5.8 million, respectively. 
 
 NLMF Holdco, LLC 
 
 The Company s agreement with NLMF Holdco, LLC may result in additional funding requirements to cover future project costs. The maximum exposure of potential commitments is expected to be no more than 4.0 million. We expect that these actions will provide faster, more reliable and lower cost internet to our residents. We expect to roll out this service to our other properties in the future. 
 
 40 

Capital Expenditures and Value-Add Program 
 We anticipate incurring average annual repairs and maintenance expense of 575 to 725 per apartment unit in connection with the ongoing operations of our business. These expenditures are expensed as incurred. In addition, we reserve, on average, approximately 250 to 350 per apartment unit for non-recurring capital expenditures and/or lender required replacement reserves. When incurred, these expenditures are either capitalized or expensed, in accordance with GAAP, depending on the type of the expenditure. Although we will continuously monitor the adequacy of this average, we believe these figures to be sufficient to maintain the properties at a high level in the markets in which we operate. A majority of the properties in our Portfolio were underwritten and acquired with the premise that we would invest 4,000 to 10,000 per unit in the first 36 months of ownership, in an effort to add value to the asset s exterior and interiors. In many cases, we reserve cash at the closing of each acquisition to fund these planned capital expenditures and value-add improvements. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 3.5 million of renovation value-add reserves for our planned capital expenditures and other expenses to implement our value-add program, which will provide further funding for our interior and exterior rehab initiatives at several properties. The following table sets forth a summary of our capital expenditures related to our value-add program for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Income Taxes 
 We anticipate that we will continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we intend to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit us to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90 of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85 of our ordinary income, (2) 95 of our capital gain net income and (3) 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT. 
 We evaluate the accounting and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not (greater than 50 percent probability) of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Our management is required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which include federal and certain states. We have no examinations in progress and none are expected at this time. 
 41 

We recognize our tax positions and evaluate them using a two-step process. First, we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Second, we will determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. 
 We had no material unrecognized tax benefit or expense, accrued interest or penalties as of September 30, 2024. We and our subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax of various state and local jurisdictions. The 2023, 2022 and 2021 tax years remain open to examination by tax jurisdictions to which our subsidiaries and we are subject. When applicable, we recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
 Dividends 
 We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85 of our ordinary income, (2) 95 of our capital gain net income and (3) 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments of all or substantially all of our taxable income to holders of our common stock out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Before we make any dividend payments, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise additional capital to make cash dividends or we may make a portion of the required dividend in the form of a taxable distribution of stock or debt securities. 
 We will make dividend payments based on our estimate of taxable earnings per share of common stock, but not earnings calculated pursuant to GAAP. Our dividends and taxable income and GAAP earnings will typically differ due to items such as depreciation and amortization, fair value adjustments, differences in premium amortization and discount accretion, and non-deductible general and administrative expenses. Our quarterly dividends per share may be substantially different than our quarterly taxable earnings and GAAP earnings per share. Our Board declared our third quarterly dividend of 2024 of 0.46242 per share on July 29, 2024 which was paid on September 30, 2024 and funded out of cash flows from operations. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate these judgments, assumptions and estimates for changes that would affect the reported amounts. These estimates are based on management s historical industry experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these judgments, assumptions and estimates. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required. A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report. 
 Purchase Price Allocation 
 Upon acquisition of a property considered to be an asset acquisition, the purchase price and related acquisition costs total consideration are allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and intangible lease assets based on relative fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations. Acquisition costs are capitalized in accordance with FASB ASC 805. 
 42 

The allocation of total consideration, which is determined using inputs that are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy established by FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements), is based on management s estimate of the property s as-if vacant fair value and is calculated by using all available information such as the replacement cost of such asset, appraisals, property condition reports, market data and other related information. If any debt is assumed in an acquisition, the difference between the fair value, which is estimated using inputs that are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and the face value of debt is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt assumed. 
 Impairment 
 Real estate assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The key inputs into our impairment analysis include, but are not limited to, the holding period, net operating income, and capitalization rates. In such cases, we will evaluate the recoverability of such real estate assets based on estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of such real estate assets, and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the real estate asset. If impaired, the real estate asset will be written down to its estimated fair value. The Company s impairment analysis identifies and evaluates events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of a real estate investment may not be recoverable, including determining the period the Company will hold the rental property, net operating income, and the estimated capitalization rate for each respective real estate investment. 
 Inflation 
 The real estate market has not been directly affected by inflation in the past several years due to increases in rents nationwide. The majority of our lease terms are for a period of one year or less and reset to market if renewed. The majority of our leases also contain protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for utilities. Due to the short-term nature of our leases, we do not believe our results will be materially affected. 
 Inflation may also affect the overall cost of debt, as the implied cost of capital increases. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates in response to or in anticipation of continued inflation concerns. We intend to mitigate these risks through long-term fixed interest rate loans and interest rate hedges, which to date have included interest rate cap and interest rate swap agreements. 
 REIT Tax Election 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code and expect to continue to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, as defined by the Code, to our stockholders. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We believe we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of assets and liabilities that results from a change in market conditions. Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk with respect to our indebtedness and counterparty credit risk with respect to our interest rate derivatives. In order to minimize counterparty credit risk, we enter into and expect to enter into hedging arrangements only with major financial institutions that have high credit ratings. As of September 30, 2024, we had total indebtedness of 1.5 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 6.72 , of which 1.4 billion was debt with a floating interest rate. As of September 30, 2024, interest rate swap agreements effectively covered 75 of our 1.4 billion of floating rate debt outstanding. For purposes of calculating the adjusted weighted average interest rate of the total indebtedness, we have included the weighted average fixed rate of 0.98 for Adjusted SOFR on the 1.1 billion notional amount of interest rate swap agreements that we have entered into as of September 30, 2024, which effectively fix the interest rate on 1.4 billion of our floating rate mortgage debt outstanding. 
 An increase in interest rates could make the financing of any acquisition by us more costly. Rising or high interest rates could also limit our ability to refinance our debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness. We may manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to our borrowings by means of interest rate cap and interest rate swap agreements. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate cap agreements we have entered into effectively cap SOFR on 2.1 billion of our floating rate mortgage debt at a weighted average rate of 6.87 for the term of the agreements, which is generally three to four years. We also expect to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rates for our indebtedness. 
 In order to fix a portion of, and mitigate the risk associated with, our floating rate indebtedness (without incurring substantial prepayment penalties or defeasance costs typically associated with fixed rate indebtedness when repaid early or refinanced), we, through the OP, have entered into ten interest rate swap transactions with the Counterparties with a combined notional amount of 1.1 billion. The interest rate swaps we have entered into effectively replace the floating interest rate (SOFR) with respect to that amount with a weighted average fixed rate of 0.98 . During the term of these interest rate swap agreements, we are required to make monthly fixed rate payments of 0.98 , on a weighted average basis, on the notional amounts, while the Counterparties are obligated to make monthly floating rate payments based on Adjusted SOFR to us referencing the same notional amounts. We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. 
 Until our interest rates reach the caps provided by our interest rate cap agreements, each quarter point change in SOFR would result in an approximate increase to annual interest expense costs on our floating rate indebtedness, reduced by any payments due from the Counterparties under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements we had entered into as of September 30, 2024, of the amounts illustrated in the table below for our indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 

Change in Interest Rates

900 

0.50 

1,800 

0.75 

2,700 

1.00 

3,600 

There is no assurance that we would realize such expense as such changes in interest rates could alter our liability positions or strategies in response to such changes. 
 We may also be exposed to credit risk in the derivative financial instruments we use. Credit risk is the failure of the Counterparties to perform under the terms of the derivative financial instruments. If the fair value of a derivative financial instrument is positive, the Counterparties will owe us, which creates credit risk for us. If the fair value of a derivative financial instrument is negative, we will owe the Counterparties and, therefore, do not have credit risk. We seek to minimize the credit risk in derivative financial instruments by entering into transactions with major financial institutions that have high credit ratings.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of September 30, 2024, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 We believe, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 45 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Management is not aware of any legal proceedings of which the outcome is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, nor are we aware of any such legal proceedings contemplated by government agencies. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
 Repurchase of Shares 
 On October 25, 2022, we announced that our Board authorized us to repurchase an indeterminate number of shares of our common stock at an aggregate market value of up to 100.0 million during a two-year period that expired on October 24, 2024. On October 29, 2024, we announced that our Board authorized us to repurchase an indeterminate number of shares of our common stock at an aggregate market value of up to 100.0 million during a two-year period that will expire on October 28, 2026. This authorization replaced the Board s prior authorization of the share repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 438,678 shares of its common stock, par value of 0.01 per share, at a total cost of approximately 14.6 million, or 33.19 per share on average. Since inception of the Share Repurchase Program through September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased 2,989,306 shares of its common stock, par value 0.01 per share, at a total cost of approximately 86.9 million, or 29.07 per share.
