CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements contained in this Quarterly Report, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, statements about our beliefs and expectations regarding our future results of operations and financial position, planned business model and strategy, timing and likelihood of success, capacity, functionality and timing of operation of data centers, expectations regarding the operations of data centers, potential strategic initiatives, such as joint ventures and partnerships, and management plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, seeks, intends, targets, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, forecasts, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements use these words or expressions. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are only predictions and are largely based on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 Our business and the markets in which we operate are new and rapidly evolving, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. 
 We have an evolving business model and strategy, and efforts we may make to modify aspects of our business model or engage in various strategic initiatives could cause us to become subject to additional regulatory scrutiny, may require additional capital, and may not be successful or result in intended benefits. 
 We are exposed to risks related to our ability to successfully source and develop new data centers and we may be unable to complete construction of our currently planned data centers, such as the Black Pearl Facility and the Barber Lake Facility, in a timely and cost-efficient manner. 
 We may need to raise capital to pursue certain business opportunities and strategic advancements, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us. 
 We have in the past and may in the future form joint ventures, strategic partnerships and make other investments as part of our growth and business strategy, any of which could negatively affect our operating results, dilute our stockholders ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expenses. 
 Any unfavorable global economic, business or political conditions, such as geopolitical tensions, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, and similar events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our increased focus on high-performance compute ("HPC") hosting opportunities may not be successful and may result in adverse consequences to our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Bitcoin mining and HPC activities are energy-intensive, which may restrict the geographic locations of miners and operations, in particular, to locations with renewable sources of power. 
 Regulatory changes or actions may restrict the use of bitcoin or HPC activities in a manner that adversely affects our business, prospects or operations, such as restrictions the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to Bitcoin miners or HPC operators, including us, or Bitcoin mining or HPC activities generally. 
 The further development and acceptance of digital asset networks and other digital assets, which represent a rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of digital asset systems may adversely affect an investment in us. 
 We may face several risks due to disruptions in the crypto asset markets generally and specifically, bitcoin, including but not limited to, the risk from depreciation in our stock price, financing risk, risk of increased losses or impairments in our investments or other assets, risks of legal proceedings and government investigations, and risks from price declines or price volatility of crypto assets generally and specifically, the volatility of bitcoin. 
 1 

If we fail to take steps to stay competitive in our industry, such as failing to grow our hashrate, we may be unable to compete, and our results of operations could suffer. 
 We have concentrated our operations and, thus, are particularly exposed to the performance of the Odessa Facility, and we may be unable to successfully adapt to, comply with and respond to changes in the regulatory environment, market conditions and natural disasters in Texas. 
 We depend on third parties, including electric grid operators, electric utility providers and manufacturers of certain critical equipment and rely on components and raw materials that may be subject to price fluctuations or shortages, including ASIC chips that have been subject to periods of significant shortage and high innovation pace. 
 We may be affected by price fluctuations in the wholesale and retail power markets. 
 We are vulnerable to severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including severe heat, winter weather events, earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, as well as power outages and other industrial incidents or mechanical failures, which could severely disrupt the normal operation of our business, cause damage to the properties where our data centers are located, including damages not covered by insurance, and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Data center equipment, including bitcoin miners and other necessary hardware, can be difficult to obtain, subject to supply chain risk, and is subject to malfunction, technological obsolescence and physical degradation. 
 Our automated processes with respect to curtailment may adversely affect our operations. 
 Our business is subject to the impact of global market, economic and political conditions that are beyond our control and that could significantly impact our business and make our financial results more volatile. 
 We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions, often in balances that exceed federally insured limits. 
 Cybersecurity threats, such as cyber-attacks, data breaches, hacking attacks or malware, targeting us or our third-party service providers may disrupt our operations and trigger significant liability for us, which could harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business. 
 There is a potential that, in the event of a bankruptcy filing by a custodian, bitcoin held in custody could be determined to be property of a bankruptcy estate and we could be considered a general unsecured creditor thereof. 
 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not timely remediated, may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our future financial statements, and our reputation, business and the price of our common stock, as well as may lead to a loss of investor confidence in us. 
 The important factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 5, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K ), Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 13, 2024, and our other reports filed with the SEC. 
 The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report and have filed as exhibits to this Quarterly Report with the understanding that our actual future results, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise.

 Out-of-period-adjustments 
 Cost of revenue and power sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included out-of-period adjustments of approximately million and million, respectively, and million and million, respectively, that increased both cost of revenue and power sales on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and resulted in net increases to operating loss and loss before taxes of approximately million during both periods. These out-of-period adjustments related to power costs and power sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 at the Company s Odessa Facility, which are invoiced on a net basis by the Company s power provider. Management evaluated the impact of this error on the Company s previously issued audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, assessing the error both quantitatively and qualitatively, and concluded that the error was not material to the financial statements for either period. No other out-of-period adjustments were identified in the periods presented. 
 Risks and uncertainties 
 Liquidity, capital resources and limited business history 
 The Company has historically experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations; however, proceeds from sales of bitcoin are categorized as cash flows from investing activities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximate balances of cash and cash equivalents of million, working capital of million, total stockholders equity of million and an accumulated deficit of million. The Company uses proceeds from sales of bitcoin earned by or received from its bitcoin mining data centers, as well as strategic sales of shares through at-the-market offerings to support its operating expenses and capital expenditures. 
 The Company monitors its balance sheet on an ongoing basis to determine the proper mix of bitcoin retention and bitcoin sales to support its cash requirements, ongoing operations, and capital expenditures. Bitcoin is classified as a current asset on the Company s balance sheets due to its intent and ability to sell bitcoin to support operations when needed. Approximately million of cash was used for operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid approximately million for deposits on equipment primarily related to new miner purchases for its Odessa Facility, and reclassified approximately million to property and equipment related to equipment being placed into service. 
 The Company has a master loan agreement with Coinbase Credit, Inc., as lender, and Coinbase, Inc., as lending service provider. Pursuant to the master loan agreement, the Company established a secured line of credit up to million (the Credit Facility ). The Company will not incur commitment fees for unused portions of the Credit Facility. The borrowing rate on amounts drawn against the Credit Facility is determined on the basis of the Federal Funds Target Rate - Upper Bound, plus , calculated daily based on a 365-day year and payable monthly for the duration of the loan. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are available on demand, open term, and collateralized by bitcoin transferred to the lending service provider s platform. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not drawn upon the Credit Facility. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company expanded the Credit Facility to a million limit, and established a term loan facility with Coinbase with a limit of million and maximum period of (the Term Loan Facility , with an interest rate to be determined upon drawdown. Coinbase has the right to terminate loans under the Term Loan Facility if the price of bitcoin falls below . 
 Management believes that the Company s existing financial resources, including access to the Credit Facility, combined with projected cash and bitcoin inflows from its data centers and its ability to sell bitcoin received or earned, will be

NOTE 2. 
 Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. Effective for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company changed the presentation of its condensed consolidated income statement to separately disclose Compensation and benefits from General and administrative. The Company believes this presentation provides increased transparency on the nature of the respective financial statement line items. As a result, the Company reported million, and million as Compensation and benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which was previously reported in General and administrative.

 million. As a result, as of December 31, 2024, it will be considered a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, and will cease to be an emerging growth company. Due to loss of emerging growth company status, the Company will no longer be exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and its independent registered public accounting firm will evaluate and report on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. 
 Commencing with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2024, it will adopt any accounting pronouncements deferred under the extended transition period election on or before December 31, 2024.

 Overview 
 We are focused on the development and operation of industrial-scale data centers for bitcoin mining and HPC hosting. Bitcoin mining is currently our primary revenue generating business activity. 
 We currently operate four bitcoin mining data centers in Texas, including one wholly-owned and three partially-owned data centers acquired through investments in joint ventures. Our largest currently-operating data center is the Odessa data center (the Odessa Facility ), which is our wholly-owned 207 MW facility located in Odessa, Texas. We also jointly operate the Alborz data center (the Alborz Facility ), located near Happy, Texas, and the Bear data center (the Bear Facility and the Chief data center (the Chief Facility ), each of which are located near Andrews, Texas (collectively, the Data Center LLCs ). The Data Center LLCs are partially-owned through joint ventures with WindHQ LLC WindHQ ). 
 Additionally, we are developing a wholly-owned data center in Winkler County, TX Black Pearl or the Black Pearl Facility for up to 300 MW, and we expect to energize 300 MW in 2025. In September 2024, we also purchased a site where we plan to develop another wholly-owned data center in Colorado City, TX Barber Lake or the Barber Lake Facility for up to 300 MW. In October 2024, we also expanded our pipeline of sites by purchasing options to acquire up to 1.5 GW of additional sites in West and North Texas. 
 Our current intention is to continue expanding our business by developing and operating industrial-scale data centers for bitcoin mining and HPC hosting, expanding capacity at our current data centers, developing our treasury management platform and entering into other strategic arrangements, such as joint ventures, data center hosting agreements, or software licensing arrangements. We aim to be a market leader in innovation, including in bitcoin mining growth, data center construction and as a hosting partner to the world's largest HPC companies. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we operated an aggregate hashrate capacity of approximately 11.5 EH/s, utilizing approximately 327 MW of electricity, of which we owned an aggregate hashrate capacity of approximately 9.3 EH/s, utilizing approximately 266 MW of electricity.

Comparative Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 24.1 million compared to 30.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and was generated entirely from bitcoin mining operations at the Odessa Facility. The decrease year over year was primarily driven by the halving in April of 2024, which reduced the bitcoin received for mining a block from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin. This was partially offset by the increase in bitcoin price of the bitcoin we mined in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Cost of revenue 
 Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.1 million, compared with 13.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and consisted primarily of power costs at the Odessa Facility under the Luminant Power Agreement. The increase in the three months ended September 30, 2024 is driven primarily by additional expenses incurred related to the fleet upgrade at the Odessa Facility, in preparation for miners to arrive onsite in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Compensation and benefits 
 Compensation and benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.7 million, a decrease of 2.4 million compared to 17.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the expiration of Share-based compensation awards in the current quarter. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 2.1 million to 8.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in legal fees related to strategic initiatives. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 28.6 million, an increase of 12.4 million compared to Depreciation and amortization of 16.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to change in the useful life of our miners as of June 1, 2024. 
 Change in fair value of derivative asset 
 Change in fair value of derivative asset was a 48.5 million loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and was driven by the fair value of the Luminant Power Agreement. The estimated fair value of our derivative asset was derived from Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, and, due to a lack of quoted prices for similar type assets, is classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Specifically, the discounted cash flow estimation models contain quoted spot and forward prices for electricity, as well as estimated usage rates consistent with the terms of the Luminant Power Agreement, the initial term of which is five years. 
 Power sales 
 After the start of mining operations at the Odessa Facility, we sold excess electricity that was available under the Luminant Power Agreement, back to the ERCOT market through Luminant. We sold power for proceeds of 1.4 million and 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Power sales fluctuate each period based on power and bitcoin prices which are volatile. 
 Equity in income (losses) of equity investees 
 Equity in income of equity investees totaled 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to losses of 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Equity in income of equity investees consists of our 49 share in the earnings (losses) generated by our three partially-owned mining sites, and the accretion of 
 27 

the basis differences in our investments in the equity investees that resulted from contributions of miners during the year ended December 31, 2022. We are accreting these basis differences over the five-year useful life of the miners. 
 Losses on fair value of bitcoin 
 Losses on fair value of bitcoin were 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, consistent with 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The balance in both periods is a result of the net realized gains and losses from selling bitcoin, and the unrealized gains and losses on the change in fair value of our bitcoin held in treasury. 
 Other income (expense) 
 Other income totaled 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to Other expense of 0.6 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily related to interest income earned from cash held in money market accounts in the current year. 
 Benefit for income taxes 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of 3.8 million primarily driven by net losses in the current period. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of 1.1 million. 
 
 Comparative Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 109.0 million, compared to 83.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and was generated entirely from bitcoin mining operations at the Odessa Facility. The increase year over year was primarily driven by an overall increase in bitcoin price in the current year period. 
 Cost of revenue 
 Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 44.2 million, compared with 37.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and consisted primarily of power costs at the Odessa Facility. The increase in the current year period is primarily due to expenses incurred related to the fleet upgrade at the Odessa Facility. 
 Compensation and benefits 
 Compensation and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 44.1 million, an increase of 2.4 million compared to 41.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to Share-based compensation awards at higher stock prices in the current period. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 2.4 million to 23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 21.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in legal fees related to strategic initiatives. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 66.1 million, an increase of 23.8 million compared to Depreciation and amortization of 42.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased miners, and mining equipment at the Odessa Facility, as well as the change in the estimated useful life of our miners from five years to three years. 
 Change in fair value of derivative asset 
 Change in fair value of derivative asset was 19.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was driven by the fair value of the Luminant Power Agreement. The estimated fair value of our derivative asset was derived from Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, and, due to a lack of quoted prices for similar type assets, is classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Specifically, the discounted cash flow estimation models contain quoted spot and forward prices for 
 28 

electricity, as well as estimated usage rates consistent with the terms of the Luminant Power Agreement, the initial term of which is five years. 
 Power sales 
 After the start of mining operations at the Odessa Facility on November 22, 2022, we sold excess electricity that was available under the Luminant Power Agreement, but not needed in our mining operations at the Odessa Facility, back to the ERCOT market through Luminant. We sold power for proceeds of 3.7 million and 8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Power sales fluctuate each period based on power and bitcoin prices which are volatile. 
 Equity in losses of equity investees 
 Equity in income of equity investees totaled 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to losses of 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Equity in losses of equity investees consists of our 49 share in the earnings (losses) generated by our three partially-owned mining sites, and the accretion of the basis differences in our investments in the equity investees that resulted from contributions of miners during the year ended December 31, 2022. We are accreting these basis differences over the five-year useful life of the miners. 
 Gains on fair value of bitcoin 
 Gains on fair value of bitcoin totaled 22.3 million and 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase in the current period is primarily due to the increase in our bitcoin treasury compared to the prior period, as well as the increase in bitcoin price in the current period compared to the prior period. 
 Other income (expense) 
 Other income totaled 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.5 million of Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily related to interest income on cash held in interest bearing accounts in the current year period. 
 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for income taxes of 2.3 million as a result of projected income for the current year in the jurisdictions which we operate. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of 0.4 million. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We used cash flows from operations of 58.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 25.3 million, total stockholders equity of 672.0 million and an accumulated deficit of 198.9 million. We fund operations through a combination of at-the-market stock issuances and bitcoin sales. 
 On September 21, 2022, we filed the Registration Statement with the SEC. In connection with the filing of the Registration Statement, we also entered into an at-the market offering agreement (the Prior Sales Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC (the Prior Agent ), under which we may, from time to time, sell shares of our Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 250.0 million in at-the-market offerings through the Agent, which is included in the 500.0 million of securities that may be offered pursuant to the Registration Statement. Effective August 1, 2023, the Company terminated the Prior Sales Agreement. 
 On August 3, 2023, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Co., Canaccord Genuity LLC, Needham Company, LLC and Compass Point Research Trading, LLC (each, an Original Agent and, together, the Original Agents ), pursuant to which we may offer and sell pursuant to a prospectus supplement, from time to time through or to the Original Agents, shares of our Common Stock, for aggregate gross proceeds of up to 250.0 million. The offering and sale of up to 250.0 million of the Shares has been registered under the Registration Statement, the base prospectus contained within the Registration Statement, and a prospectus supplement that was filed with the SEC on August 4, 2023 (the Prospectus Supplement ). 
 29 

On March 6, 2024, we entered into an amendment (the Amendment to the Sales Agreement (as amended, the Amended Sales Agreement by and among the Original Agents, Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Incorporated Stifel and Virtu Americas LLC Virtu ). The Amendment modifies the Sales Agreement to include Stifel and Virtu as additional agents under the Amended Sales Agreement. On March 6, 2024, we also filed an amendment to the Prospectus Supplement (i) increasing the dollar amount of shares available to be sold pursuant to the Amended Sales Agreement, to 296,560,661, which consists of 96,560,661 remaining as originally authorized under the Prospectus Supplement and an additional 200,000,000, and (ii) including Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Incorporated and Virtu Americas LLC as additional agents. 
 
 On September 3, 2024, we amended and restated the Amended Sales Agreement (as amended and restated, the Amended and Restated Sales Agreement with the Original Agents, Keefe, Bruyette Woods, Inc. KBW ), Virtu and BTIG, LLC BTIG (each, an Agent and, together, the Agents ). The Amended and Restated Sales Agreement modified the Amended Sales Agreement to, among other things, include BTIG as an additional Agent under the Amended and Restated Sales Agreement and to replace Stifel with KBW as an Agent under the Amended and Restated Sales Agreement. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds on sales of 18.0 million shares of common stock under the Amended and Restated Sales Agreement of approximately 61.3 million (net of commissions and expenses) at an average net selling price of 3.41 per share. 
 On August 14, 2023, we entered into a master loan agreement with Coinbase Credit, Inc., as lender, and Coinbase, Inc., as lending service provider. Pursuant to the master loan agreement, we established a secured line of credit up to 10.0 million (the Credit Facility ). We will not incur commitment fees for unused portions of the Credit Facility. The borrowing rate on amounts drawn against the Credit Facility is determined on the basis of the Federal Funds Target Rate - Upper Bound, plus 2.5 , calculated daily based on a 365-day year and payable monthly for the duration of the loan. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are available on demand, open term, and collateralized by bitcoin transferred to the lending service provider s platform. As of September 30, 2024 we have not drawn upon the Credit Facility. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we expanded the Credit Facility to a 15.0 million limit, and established a term loan facility with Coinbase with a limit of 35.0 million and maximum period of one year (the Term Loan Facility ). Coinbase has the right to terminate loans under the Term Loan Facility if the price of bitcoin falls below 40,000. 
 Management believes that our existing financial resources, combined with projected cash and bitcoin inflows from our data centers and our intent and ability to sell bitcoin received or earned, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least 12 months from the date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (58,533) (46,325) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (195,147) 37,802 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 207,309 (62) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (46,371) (8,585) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities increased by 12.2 million to 58.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 46.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We incurred a net loss of 62.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 36.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 25.8 million. Cash flows from operating activities was impacted by a 8.5 million increase in non-cash items, primarily driven by a 26.3 million increase in bitcoin received as payment from our mining pool operator, 32.5 million loss on our derivative asset, and a 19.1 million increase in gains on the fair value of bitcoin. Additionally, changes in assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in cash used of 5.1 million between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Investing Activities 
 Cash flows used in investing activities increased by 233 million to 195.1 million of net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 37.8 million of net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to 130.7 million of deposits primarily related to new miner purchases, and a 25.6 million increase in contributions to equity investees related to capital expenditures and operations at the Bear and Chief facilities, partially offset by a 59.4 million increase in purchases of property and equipment related to building out the Black Pearl facility, and acquisition of the Barber Lake Facility.

 Limited Business History; Need for Additional Capital 
 There is limited historical financial information about the Company upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in exploration and/or development, and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services. We may require additional capital to pursue certain business opportunities or respond to technological advancements, competitive dynamics or technologies, customer demands, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs related to being a public company. Accordingly, we may in engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for the above-mentioned or other reasons; however, we may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financings on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional funds through equity financing, our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution. Furthermore, any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on terms that are satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support the business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, which may adversely affect our business plan. For risks associated with this, see Risks Factors Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations We may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments 
 On December 17, 2021, we entered into a lease agreement for executive office space, with an effective term that commenced on February 1, 2022 and monthly rent payments of approximately 0.1 million. The initial lease term was for a period of five years and four months. During the second quarter of 2024, we entered into an amendment to the lease agreement commencing on May 15, 2024, to increase the leased office space and extend the term through May 2029. Monthly rent payments associated with the amended lease are approximately 0.2 million. 
 We also entered into a series of agreements with affiliates of Luminant ET Services Company LLC Luminant ), including the Lease Agreement dated June 29, 2021, with amendment and restatement on July 9, 2021 (as amended and restated, the Luminant Lease Agreement ). The Luminant Lease Agreement leases a plot of land to us where our data center, ancillary infrastructure and electrical system (the Interconnection Electrical Facilities or substation have been set up for our Odessa Facility. We entered into the Luminant Lease Agreement and the Luminant Purchase and Sale Agreement to build the infrastructure necessary to support our planned operations. Management determined that the Luminant Lease Agreement and the Luminant Purchase and Sale Agreement should be combined for accounting purposes under ASC 842 (collectively, the Combined Luminant Lease Agreement and that amounts exchanged under the combined contract should be allocated to the various components of the overall transaction based on relative fair values. 
 Our management determined that the Combined Luminant Lease Agreement contains two lease components; and the components should be accounted for together as a single lease component, because the effect of accounting for the land lease separately would be insignificant. 
 The Combined Luminant Lease Agreement commenced on November 22, 2022 and has an initial term of five years, with renewal provisions that are aligned with the Luminant Power Agreement. Financing for use of the land and 
 31 

substation is provided by Luminant affiliates. Despite lease commencement in November 2022, we had not been required by Luminant to make any lease payments for the substation prior to July 2023, therefore we accrued amounts due under the Combined Luminant Lease Agreement in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 On August 23, 2023, we entered into a second amendment of the Luminant Lease Agreement, the terms of which included an amended payment schedule, reflecting monthly installments of principal and interest totaling 19.7 million on an undiscounted basis, due over the remaining four-year period starting in July 2023. This amendment did not have a material impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 At the end of the lease term for the Interconnection Electrical Facilities, the substation will be sold back to Luminant s affiliate, Vistra Operations Company, LLC at a price to be determined based upon bids obtained in the secondary market. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We are providing supplemental financial measures for Adjusted Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per share - diluted, in each case that exclude the impact of (i) the non-cash change in fair value of derivative asset, (ii) share-based compensation expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) deferred income tax expense, (v) nonrecurring gains and losses and (vi) the non-cash change in fair value of warrant liability. These supplemental financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United Stated GAAP and, as a result, these supplemental financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to help understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and to help make operating decisions. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures can also facilitate comparison of our operating results to those of our competitors. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For example, we expect that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from the non-GAAP financial measure, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers and directors. Similarly, we expect that depreciation and amortization will continue to be a recurring expense over the term of the useful life of the related assets. Our non-GAAP financial measure is not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We rely primarily on such condensed consolidated financial statements to understand, manage and evaluate our business performance and use the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. 
 The following is a reconciliation of our Adjusted Earnings (Loss) to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the periods indicated (in thousands):

 Critical Accounting Policies, and Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. A description of our significant accounting policies in included in our 2023 Form 10-K. You should read the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K, except the change in estimated useful life of our miners from five years to three years, as described in Note 5. Property and Equipment of Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements applicable to us, adopted and not yet adopted as of the date of this report, is included in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements located in Part I - Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report. 
 Emerging Growth Company 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period to enable us to comply with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 On the last business day of the second quarter in 2024, the aggregate market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliate stockholders exceeded 700 million. As a result, as of December 31, 2024, we will be considered a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, and will cease to be an emerging growth company. Due to loss of emerging growth company status, we will no longer be exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and our independent registered public accounting firm will evaluate and report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures Disclosure Controls ), as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. The Disclosure Controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the goal being that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Remediation of Material Weakness 
 As noted in the 2023 Form 10-K, during management s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting, a material weakness was identified related to certain Information Technology General Controls over user access, segregation of duties and change management controls. 
 As management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, we understand the importance of developing a resolution plan aligned with management and overseen by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Since the material weakness was identified, management began implementing and has continued to implement and refine measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. Our plan includes the following: 
 Enhance our remediation efforts by continuing to devote resources in 2024 in key financial reporting and information technology areas, including hiring additional employees. 
 Continue to utilize an external third-party internal audit and SOX 404 implementation firm to work to improve the Company s controls related to our material weaknesses, specifically relating to user access and change management surrounding the Company s IT systems and applications. 
 Continue to implement new processes and controls and engage external resources when required in connection with remediating this material weakness, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. 
 Continue to formalize our policies and processes including those over outside service providers with a specific focus on enhancing design and documentation related to (i) developing and communicating additional policies and procedures to govern the areas of IT change management and user access processes and related control activities and (ii) develop robust processes to validate data received from third-parties and relied upon to generate financial statements that are complete and accurate. 
 34 

We recognize that the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and can be tested and concluded by management to be designed and operating effectively. Because our remediation efforts involve our outsourced service providers, we cannot provide any assurance that these remediation efforts will be successful or that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of these efforts. 
 We continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting related to the identified material weaknesses and management may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify the remediation plan described above. In addition, we report the progress and status of the above remediation efforts to the Audit Committee on a periodic basis. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the remediation efforts described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. There have been no material changes to such proceedings previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to the risk factors as previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K, except for the risk factor noted below. 
 We will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company as of December 31, 2024 and, as a result, we will no longer be able to avail ourselves of certain reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies, subject to applicable transition relief. 
 We are currently an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we have taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, compliance with requirements that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies. 
 Because the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700 million as of June 30, 2024, we will be deemed a large accelerated filer under the Exchange Act and will lose our status as an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2024. As a result, subject to certain grace periods, we will be required to: 
 engage an independent registered public accounting firm to provide an attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 
 submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes; and 
 disclose a compensation discussion and analysis, including disclosure regarding certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation. 
 We will no longer able to take advantage of cost savings associated with the JOBS Act. Furthermore, if the additional requirements applicable to non-emerging growth companies divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a non-emerging growth company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation. 
 As a result of our loss of emerging growth company status, it is possible that investors will find our common stock less attractive in light of the fact that we have relied on certain of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our share price may be more volatile. In addition, any failure to comply with these additional requirements in a timely manner, or at all, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.
