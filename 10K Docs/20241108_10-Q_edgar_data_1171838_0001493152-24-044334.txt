risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially depending on a variety of factors,
many of which are not within our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, economic conditions generally and in the industry
in which we and our customers participate; competition within our industry; legislative requirements or changes which could render our

statements by these cautionary statements. 

These
forward-looking statements speak only as of their dates and should not be unduly relied upon. We undertake no obligation to amend this
report or revise publicly these forward-looking statements (other than pursuant to reporting obligations imposed on registrants pursuant
to the Exchange Act) to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, whether as the result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report
and in our other filings with the Commission. 

Overview 

Our
historical business model has focused on purchasing or acquiring life insurance policies and residual interests in or financial products
tied to life insurance policies, including notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable and other obligations representing part
or all of the sales price of insurance, life settlements and related insurance contracts being traded in the secondary marketplace, often
referred to as the life settlements market. 

We
currently do not hold life settlement or life insurance policies but, rather, previously held a contractual right to receive the net
insurance benefits, or NIBs , from a portfolio of life insurance policies held by a third party the Owners 
or the Holders ). These NIBs represented an indirect, residual ownership interest in a portfolio of individual life insurance
policies, and they allowed us to receive a portion of the settlement proceeds from such policies, after expenses related to the acquisition,
financing, insuring and servicing of the policies underlying our NIBs have been paid. 

NIBs
are generally sold by an entity that holds the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies, either directly or indirectly through
a subsidiary, such an entity being referred to herein as a Holder. A Holder, either directly or through a wholly owned
subsidiary, purchases life insurance policies either from the insured or on the secondary market and aggregates them into a portfolio
of policies. At the time of purchase, the Holder also (i) contracts with a service provider to manage the servicing of the policies until
maturity, (ii) consider purchasing mortality re-insurance MRI coverage under which payments will be made to the Holder
in the event the insurance policies do not mature according to actuarial life expectancies, and (iii) arranges financing to cover the
initial purchase of the insurance policies, the servicing of the life insurance policies until maturity and the payment of the MRI premiums.
The financing obtained by the Holder for a portfolio of life settlement or life insurance policies is secured by the insurance policies
for which the financing was obtained. After a Holder purchases policies, aggregates them into a portfolio and arranges for the servicing,
MRI coverage and financing, the Holder contracts to sell NIBs related to the policies, which gives the holder of the NIBs the right to
receive the proceeds from the settlement of the insurance policies after all of the expenses related to such policies have been paid.
When an insurance policy underlying our NIBs comes to maturity, the insurance proceeds are first used to pay expenses associated with
such policy. Once all of the expenses have been paid, the Holder will retain a small percentage of the proceeds and then will pay the
remaining insurance proceeds to us.

During
the latter part of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we began developing an additional business offering, providing professional
services to specialty structured finance groups, bond issuers and life settlement aggregators. We have assembled an experienced team
from the life settlement marketplace, as well as from other areas such as financial services and public financial markets. As a professional
services provider, we apply industry best practices to advise on the selection of specific portfolios of life insurance policies that
are tailored to meet the needs of its clients. Our clients may include bond issuers, bond investors, or other structured finance product
issuers. We develop strategies and methodologies which include the acquisition of life insurance portfolios, then uses common structured
finance techniques and proprietary analytics to structure bonds for issuances, including principal protected bonds. Our goal is to deliver
long-term value and profitability to shareholders by growing our professional services business and asset base, resulting in the ability
to pay dividends to its shareholders. 

The
Company has developed an additional business offering working closely with bond placement agents and aggregators to establish various
aspects of a proprietary, investment grade bond offering. In this arrangement, we participate as the sole originator in the role of structuring
and advising on the structure of the proprietary bond instrument. Included in the role of structuring financial assets, we use proprietary
analytics to establish the makeup of the rated instrument, including but not limited to, life settlement assets (life insurance policies)
and managed cash, and implement a process of selective assembly of the underlying assets and cash management that will meet the policy
requirements and analytics. We provide current and ongoing resources for all analytics, as well as advisement support for the investment
and non-investment grade ratings for the managed asset pool and the managed cash accounts. In our advisory role, we are reimbursed for
all expenses associated with the structuring and preparation of any bond offering, will receive an advisory payment upon the closing
of any bond offering, and then will hold residual rights on the balance of assets once the bond is retired.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Since
our inception our operations have been primarily financed through sales of equity instruments, debt financing, lines of credit and notes
payable from related parties and the issuance of convertible debentures. As of September 30, 2024, we had 428,475 of cash, compared
to 329,860 as of March 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had access to draw an additional 4,265,942 on the notes payable,
related party and 3,000,000 on the Convertible Debenture Agreement. Our monthly expenses are anticipated to be approximately 63,000,
which includes salaries of our employee, policy servicing expenses, consulting agreements and contract labor, general and administrative
expenses, estimated legal and accounting expenses. Outstanding Accounts Payable as of September 30, 2024, totaled 447,688, and other
accrued liabilities totaled 1,848,050. We believe that our availability under our existing lines of credit with related parties, our
existing capital resources, together with the issuance of additional notes payable and convertible debentures will be sufficient to fund
our operating working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, or through November 2025.

Debt 

At
September 30, 2024, we owed 5,180,504, including accrued interest, for debt obligations. We owed 3,290,058 in principal pursuant to

on the 8 Convertible Debenture. As of September 30, 2024, a line-of-credit to a third party had a balance of 1,159,508 due on November
30, 2025, or when the Company completes a successful equity raise, at which time principal and interest is due in full. A line-of-credit
to a second third party had a principal balance of 1,304,550 and is currently extended due on November 30, 2025. As of September 30,
2024, unsecured promissory notes had principal balances totaling 826,000 and are due on November 30, 2025. The convertible debenture

the 8 convertible debenture agreement.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Limitation
on the Effectiveness of Controls 

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required
to be disclosed timely, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls
and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls
and procedures. 

Evaluation
of Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officer has concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report were not effective due to the lack of
design and operating effectiveness of our control environment and risk assessment, control activities and monitoring activities relating
to complex accounting matters relating to the valuation of equity-based compensation instruments as disclosed in Item 9A of our 10K filed
on June 29, 2022. 

Our
principal executive and principal financial officer is in the process of performing a review of our processes and controls over complex
accounting matters relating to the valuation of equity-based compensation instruments. 

Changes
in Internal Control 

T here
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the first quarter of 2025 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
