 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis In addition to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company also has assets and liabilities in its balance sheet that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain long-lived assets, including equity method investments, goodwill and other intangible assets, typically as it relates to impairment. The Company has determined that the fair value measurements included in each of these assets and liabilities rely primarily on Company-specific inputs and the Company s assumptions about the use of the assets and settlements of liabilities, as observable inputs are not available. The Company has determined that each of these fair value measurements reside within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. To determine the fair value of long-lived assets, the Company utilizes the projected cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived assets, then discounts the future cash flows over the expected life of the long-lived assets. For the three and nine months periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company did t record any material impairment charges on its long-lived assets for its operations.

With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examination by U.S. state or local tax authorities or by non-U.S. tax authorities for years before 2012. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is not aware of any proposed income tax adjustments resulting from tax examinations that would have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. The conclusion of such audits could result in additional increases or decreases to unrecognized tax benefits in some future period or periods.

The remaining components - Interest cost, Expected return on plan assets, Amortization of actuarial loss, Settlement loss (gain) and Curtailment gain - are reported as Other non-operating items, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company triggered settlement accounting for the primary U.S. pension plan in the third quarter of 2024 because the lump-sum payments made during the quarter exceeded the sum of Service cost and Interest cost for this U.S. plan. Due to the settlement accounting, the obligation and plan assets for the primary U.S. plan have been re-measured as of September 30, 2024, which resulted in an immaterial change in the net pension liability compared to December 31, 2023 . The discount rate used to determine the U.S. net periodic benefit cost because of the re-measurement was changed from to in the third quarter of 2024 . The expected long-term rate of return on plan asset is unchanged at .

In addition, as vehicle manufacturers increasingly use global platforms and procedures, quality performance evaluations are also conducted on a global basis. Any one or more quality, warranty or other recall issue(s) (including those affecting few units and/or having a small financial impact) may cause a vehicle manufacturer to implement measures such as a temporary or prolonged suspension of new orders, which may have a material impact on the Company s results of operations.

million for total product related liabilities. The majority of the total product liability accrual as of September 30, 2024, relates to recalls, which are generally covered by insurance. Insurance receivables for such recall related liabilities total million as of September 30, 2024. Product Liability: Autoliv and some of its subsidiaries have been named as one of several defendants in a consolidated class action lawsuit in a multi-district litigation (In Re: ARC Airbag Inflators Products Liability Litigation MDL, No. 3051) in the Northern District of Georgia. The plaintiffs in the multi-district litigation (the "ARC Inflator Class Action") brought claims for fraud, breach of warranty, and violations of consumer protection and trade practices stemming from ARC inflators included in airbag modules that Autoliv or its subsidiaries allegedly supplied after Autoliv acquired certain Delphi assets (the Delphi Acquisition in December 2009. The Company denies these allegations. Autoliv is not aware of any performance issues regarding ARC inflators included with its airbags at the directions of its customers that it shipped following the Delphi Acquisition. The proceedings remain ongoing. The Company has determined pursuant to ASC 450 that a loss is reasonably possible with respect to the ARC Inflator Class Action. However, the Company continues to evaluate this matter, no accrual has been made, and no estimated range of potential loss can be determined at this time. The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the ARC Inflator Class Action. On September 5, 2023, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA issued an initial decision to recall approximately million frontal driver and passenger airbag inflators manufactured by ARC and Delphi Automotive Systems because NHTSA determined that the airbag inflators contain a safety defect resulting in field ruptures. Some of the ARC inflators included in the airbag modules that Autoliv or its subsidiaries supplied after the Delphi Acquisition were included in such initial decision. NHTSA has yet to release its final decision. If NHTSA's final decision results in a recall, it is anticipated that such decision will be challenged in US federal court. The Company has determined pursuant to ASC 450 that a loss is reasonably possible with respect to the NHTSA ARC recall. However, the Company continues to evaluate this matter, no accrual has been made, and no estimated range of potential loss can be determined at this time. The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the NHTSA ARC recall. Specific Recalls: In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company was made aware of a potential recall by American Honda Motor Co. and the recall of approximately vehicles relating to the malfunction of front seat belt buckles was announced on March 9, 2023 (the Honda Buckle Recall ). The Company determined pursuant to ASC 450 that a loss with respect to the Honda Buckle Recall is probable and accrued an amount that is reflected in the total product liability accrual in the fourth quarter of 2020, increased the accrual in the fourth quarter of 2021 and reduced the accrual in the fourth quarter of 2023 based on vehicle repair cost data. Following the accrual reduction in the fourth quarter of 2023, the amount by which the product liability accrual exceeds the product liability insurance receivable with respect to the Honda Buckle Recall is million and includes self-insurance retention costs and deductibles. The ultimate loss to the Company of the Honda Buckle Recall could be materially different from the amount the Company has accrued. Volvo Car USA, LLC (together with its affiliates, Volvo has recalled approximately vehicles relating to the malfunction of inflators produced by ZF (the ZF Inflator Recall ). The recalled ZF inflators were included in airbag modules supplied by the Company only to Volvo. The recall commenced in November 2020 and later expanded in September 2021. Because the Company s airbags were involved with the ZF Inflator Recall, the Company has determined pursuant to ASC 450 that a loss is reasonably possible with respect to the ZF Inflator Recall. The Company continues to evaluate this matter with Volvo and ZF and accrual has been made. Although the Company currently estimates a range of to million with respect to this potential loss, the Company anticipates that any losses net of insurance claims and claims against ZF will be immaterial. Intellectual Property: In its products, the Company utilizes technologies which may be subject to intellectual property rights of third parties. While the Company does seek to procure the necessary rights to utilize intellectual property rights associated with its products, it may fail to do so. Where the Company so fails, the Company may be exposed to material claims from the owners of such rights. Where the Company has sold products which infringe upon such rights, its customers may be entitled to be indemnified by the Company for the claims they suffer as a result thereof. Such claims could be material. The table in Note 7 above summarizes the change in the balance sheet position of the product-related liabilities.

Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures Some of the following discussions refer to non-U.S. GAAP financial measures: see reconciliations for Organic sales , Trade working capital , Free cash flow , Net debt , Leverage ratio , Adjusted operating income , Adjusted operating margin and Adjusted earnings per share, diluted provided below. Management believes that these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures provide supplemental information to investors regarding the performance of the Company s business and assist investors in analyzing trends in the Company's business. Additional descriptions regarding management s use of these financial measures are included below. Investors should consider these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures in addition to, rather than as substitutes for, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These historical non-U.S. GAAP financial measures have been identified as applicable in each section of this report with a tabular presentation reconciling them to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. It should be noted that these measures, as defined, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Light vehicle production was weak in the third quarter, declining by close to 5 globally. This was driven by a combination of inventory reductions, especially in the Americas and a high comparison base, especially in China. In this tough environment, Autoliv managed to outgrow LVP by 4pp, enabling almost unchanged sales and operating income. This is despite a 14 million cost item related to a supplier settlement. We were able to achieve these results mainly due to our cost control, including a continued reduction of our indirect workforce. We accelerated our efficiency improvements contributing to a reduction of direct headcount by 3,100 compared to a year earlier, which is a reduction of 6 . We are pleased that we outgrew LVP on a global basis following substantial outperformance in Europe and Asia excl. China. Our sales underperformed LVP in China due to a substantial negative market mix, however, our position with Chinese OEMs continue to improve. Based on sales trends and order intake in recent years, we expect further market share gains with domestic Chinese OEMs in the coming years. Excess inflation compensation negotiations with our customers have developed in line with our expectations with a few negotiations still outstanding. With the seasonally strong fourth quarter remaining of the year, we reaffirm our guidance of around 9.5-10.0 adjusted operating margin (Non-U.S. GAAP measure) for 2024. We expect to be at the low end of this range, as we now expect full year 2024 organic growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure) to be 1 instead of previously expected 2 due to the unfavorable market mix development. Our operating cash flow is on track towards the full year guidance of 1.1 billion and our balance sheet remains strong with a debt leverage of 1.4x (Non-U.S. GAAP measure), which supports our continued commitment to a high level of shareholder returns and our financial targets. Financial highlights in the three months period ended September 30, 2024 Change figures below compare to the same period of the previous year, except when stated otherwise. 2,555 million net sales 1.6 net sales decrease 0.8 organic sales decline (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below) 8.9 operating margin 9.3 adjusted operating margin (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below) 1.74 EPS, 13 increase 1.84 adjusted EPS (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below), 12 increase

Key business developments in the three months period ended September 30, 2024 Change figures below compare to the same period of the previous year, except when stated otherwise. Third quarter sales decreased organically (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below) by 0.8 , which was 4pp better than global LVP decline of 4.8 (S P Global Oct 2024). We outperformed in Europe and Asia excl. China, mainly due to high level of product launches and positive pricing. Our sales to domestic Chinese OEMs grew by 18 , which is twice as much as their LVP growth of 8.5 . Despite this, we underperformed in China, due to a substantial negative LVP mix as lower safety content models grew strongly while higher content models declined. 

 Profitability was unchanged despite a slight net sales decline. This was mainly due to successful execution of cost reductions and commercial recoveries and despite inflationary cost increases and a 14 million cost related to a supplier settlement. Both direct and indirect headcount continued to decrease. Operating income was 226 million and operating margin was 8.9 . Adjusted operating income (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below) was 237 million and adjusted operating margin (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below) was 9.3 . Return on capital employed was 22.9 and adjusted return on capital employed (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below) was 23.9 . 

 Operating cash flow was 177 million , as expected, and we are on track towards 1.1 billion for 2024. Free cash flow (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below) was 32 million compared to 50 million last year. At 1.4x, the leverage ratio (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below) remained within our target range. In the quarter, a dividend of 0.68 per share was paid, and 1.33 million shares were repurchased and retired. 

 Business and market condition update for the third quarter 2024 Supply Chain In the third quarter, global light vehicle production declined by 4.8 year-over-year (according to S P Global Oct 2024). Call-off volatility was unchanged compared to a year earlier but improved slightly compared to the second quarter 2024, and it remains at higher than pre-pandemic levels. Low customer demand visibility and changes to customer call-offs with short notice had a negative impact on our production efficiency and profitability in the quarter. We expect call-off volatility in 2024 on average to be slightly lower than it was in 2023 but still remain higher than the pre-pandemic level. Inflation In the third quarter, cost pressure from labor and other items had a negative impact on our profitability, although most of the inflationary cost pressure was offset by price increases and other customer compensations in the quarter. Raw material price changes had a negligible impact on our profitability during the third quarter. We continue to expect raw material prices in 2024 to increase slightly for the full year. We expect continued cost pressure from inflation relating mainly to labor, especially in Europe and the Americas. We continue to execute on productivity and cost reduction activities to offset these cost pressures, and have successfully received inflation compensation from almost all of our customers, with only a few negotiations still outstanding.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following table shows some of the key ratios management uses internally to analyze the Company's current and future financial performance and core operations as well as to identify trends in the Company s financial conditions and results of operations. The Company has provided this information to investors to assist in meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results and to assist in highlighting the results of ongoing core operations. These ratios are more fully explained below and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company's management uses the Return on capital employed (ROCE) and Return on total equity (ROE) measures for purposes of comparing its financial performance with the financial performance of other companies in the industry and providing useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting the Company s business. As used by the Company, ROCE is annualized operating income and income from equity method investments relative to average capital employed. The Company believes ROCE is a useful indicator of long-term performance both absolute and relative to the Company's peers as it allows for a comparison of the profitability of the Company s capital employed in its business relative to that of its peers. ROE is the ratio of annualized income (loss) relative to average total equity for the periods presented. The Company s management believes that ROE is a useful indicator of how well management creates value for its shareholders through its operating activities and its capital management.

 1) Effects from currency translations. 2) Including Corporate sales. 3) Non-U.S. GAAP measure. Sales by product - Airbags, Steering Wheels and Other Sales declined organically (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) by 0.7 in the quarter. The largest contributor to the decrease was passenger airbags, inflatable curtains, knee airbags and driver airbags, partly offset by growth in steering wheels, inflators and center airbags. Sales by product - Seatbelts and Other Sales for Seatbelt Products and Other declined organically (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) by 1.0 in the quarter. Sales declined organically in China, while it increased in Asia excluding China and the Americas with Europe being virtually unchanged. Sales by region Our global organic sales (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) decreased by 0.8 compared to the global LVP decrease of 4.8 (according to S P Global, October 2024). The outperformance was mainly driven by new product launches and higher prices, partly offset by negative customer and model mix. Our organic sales growth outperformed LVP growth by 12pp in Europe and by 10pp in Asia excluding China while we underperformed by 0.6pp in the Americas and by 6.4pp in China. LVP growth in China was heavily tilted to domestic OEMs with typically lower safety content. LVP for global OEMs declined by 15 while it increased by 8.5 for domestic OEMs. Autoliv's sales to domestic OEMs increased by 18 in the quarter following a strong order intake with domestic OEMs in recent years. In India, we grew organically by around 17 , while LVP was close to unchanged. Third quarter of 2024 organic growth 1)

1) Non-U.S. GAAP measure, excluding effects from capacity alignments, antitrust related matters and for fiscal year 2023 the Andrews litigation settlement. 2) Ne t of treasury shares. Third quarter of 2024 financial development Gross profit decreased by 6 million, and the gross margin increased by 0.1pp compared to the same quarter 2023. The gross profit decrease was primarily driven by a 14 million cost increase in direct material related to a settlement and to a lesser extent the lower net sales. This was partly offset by lower costs for mainly premium freight and labor, partly due to improved customer call-off accuracy. S,G A costs increased by 10 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to higher costs for personnel due to wage inflation while headcount was unchanged. Costs for digitalization, IT projects and licenses also increased, impacted by inflation. S,G A costs in relation to sales increased from 4.6 to 5.0 . R,D E, net costs decreased by 11 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to 6 million in higher engineering income. The decrease was also supported to a smaller extent from several items, mainly positive FX translation effects, lower personnel costs and lower costs for samples and prototypes. R,D E, net, in relation to sales decreased from 4.1 to 3.7 . Other income (expense), net was close to unchanged at negative 9 million, compared to negative 8 million in the same period last year. Operating income decreased by 6 million compared to the same period in 2023, due to the lower gross profit, higher S,G A costs and other income (expenses) partly offset by lower costs for R,D E, net, as outlined above. Adjusted operating income (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below) decreased by 6 million compared to the prior year, due to the lower gross profit, higher S,G A costs and other income (expenses) partly offset by lower costs for R,D E, net, as outlined above. Financial and non-operating items, net , was negative 29 million compared to negative 30 million a year earlier. Income before taxes decreased by 4 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to the lower operating income. Tax rate was 29.6 compared to 33.4 in the same period last year. The lower tax rate was impacted by a favorable country mix compared to the same quarter last year. Discrete tax items, net, decreased the tax rate this quarter by 1.2pp. Discrete tax items, net, increased the tax rate by 0.2pp in the same period last year. Earnings per share, diluted increased by 0.17 compared to a year earlier. The main drivers were 0.12 from lower number of shares and 0.10 from lower taxes, partly offset by 0.05 from lower operating income.

1) Non-U.S. GAAP measure, excluding effects from capacity alignments, antitrust related matters and for fiscal year 2023 the Andrews litigation settlement. 2) Net of treasury shares. First nine months 2024 financial development Gross profit increased by 85 million, and the gross margin increased by 1.0pp compared to the same period 2023. More than half of the improvement in gross profit was driven by the increase in net sales, but lower costs for labor and premium freight also contributed to the improvement following more stable customer call-offs and headcount reductions. S,G A costs increased by 18 million compared to the prior year. The main reason for the cost increase was higher costs for personnel, due to the high wage inflation. S,G A costs in relation to sales increased from 4.9 to 5.1 . R,D E, net costs decreased by 19 million compared to the prior year. Higher engineering income explain almost the entire improvement. R,D E, net, in relation to sales decreased from 4.4 to 4.2 . Other income (expense), net was negative 27 million compared to negative 115 million in the same period last year, almost entirely due to lower capacity alignment accruals compared to the same period previous year. Operating income increased by 173 million compared to the same period in 2023, mainly due to the increase in gross profit, and lower capacity alignment accruals, as outlined above. Adjusted operating income (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below) increased by 71 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to higher gross profit and lower R,D E, net partly offset by higher costs for S,G A, as outlined above. Financial and non-operating items, net , was negative 73 million compared to negative 60 million a year earlier. The change was mainly due to increased interest expense as the result of higher debt and higher interest rates. Income before taxes increased by 161 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to the increase in operating income and financial and non-operating items, net, as outlined above. Tax rate was 27.0 compared to 33.4 in the same period last year. The lower tax rate was impacted by favorable country mix compared to the prior year. Discrete tax items, net, decreased the tax rate this period by 2.8pp. Discrete tax items, net, decreased the tax rate by 0.6pp in the same period last year. Earnings per share, diluted increased by 1.94 compared to a year earlier. The main drivers were 1.67 from higher operating income, 0.29 from lower number of shares and 0.09 from taxes, partly offset by 0.11 from higher financial and non-operating items, net.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company s future contractual obligations have not changed materially from the amounts reported in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024. Third quarter of 2024 development Changes in operating working capital impacted operating cash flow by 68 million negative, compared to an impact of 36 million negative in the same period the prior year. Almost all of the 68 million impact in the quarter came from increases in inventories due to high customer call off volatility at the end of the quarter and higher receivables, mainly as a result of seasonally higher sales in September. Other, net was 10 million positive compared to 9 million positive in the same period the prior year. Operating cash flow decreased by 25 million to 177 million compared to the same period last year, mainly due to that operating working capital increased by 34 million more than it increased the same period last year, as outlined above. Capital expenditure, net decreased by 6 million compared to the same period the previous year. The level of Capital expenditure, net, in relation to sales was relatively stable at 5.7 versus 5.8 a year earlier. The level is currently above what we expect for the longer term, due to investments in capacity, mainly in Asia, and in footprint optimization, mainly in Europe and the Americas. Free cash flow (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see calculation table below) was positive 32 million compared to positive 50 million in the same period the prior year. The decrease was due to the lower operating cash flow partly offset by the lower capital expenditure, net. Cash conversion (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see calculation table below) defined as free cash flow (Non-U.S. GAAP measure) in relation to net income, was 23 in the quarter. Trade working capital (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see calculation table below) increased by 4 million compared to the same period last year, where the main drivers were 13 million in higher accounts receivables, 24 million in higher accounts payable and 15 million in higher inventories. In relation to sales, trade working capital increased from 12.5 to 12.8 . Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 was around 0.4 billion, while committed, unused loan facilities, was around 1.2 billion. Net debt (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below) was 1,787 million as of September 30, 2024, which was 412 million higher than a year earlier. Total equity as of September 30, 2024, decreased by 188 million compared to September 30, 2023. This was mainly due to 221 million in dividend payments and stock repurchases including taxes of 608 million, partly offset by 632 million from net income. Leverage ratio (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see calculation table below). On September 30, 2024, the Company had a leverage ratio of 1.4x compared to 1.3x on September 30, 2023, as the 12 months trailing adjusted EBITDA (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below) increased by around 187 million while the net debt per the policy (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below) increased by around 407 million. First nine months of 2024 development Operating cash flow increased by 104 million compared to the same period last year, to 639 million, mainly due to higher net income, partly offset by more negative effects from increased operating working capital. Capital expenditure, net increased by 12 million. Capital expenditure, net in relation to sales was relatively stable at 5.5 versus 5.4 the prior year period. The level is currently slightly above what we expect for the longer term, due to investments in capacity, mainly in Asia, and in footprint optimization, mainly in Europe and the Americas. Free cash flow (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see calculation table below) was positive 208 million, compared to positive 117 million in the same period last year. The improvement was due to the higher operating cash flow partly offset by higher capital expenditure, net. Cash conversion (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see calculation table below) defined as free cash flow (Non-U.S. GAAP measure) in relation to net income, was 52 in the period.

NON-U.S. GAAP MEASURES The Company believes that comparability between periods is improved through the exclusion of certain items. To assist investors in understanding the operating performance of Autoliv's business, it is useful to consider certain U.S. GAAP measures exclusive of these items. With respect to the Andrews litigation settlement, the Company has treated this specific settlement as a non-recurring charge because of the unique nature of the lawsuit, including the facts and legal issues involved. Accordingly, the tables below reconcile from U.S. GAAP to the equivalent non-U.S. GAAP measure.

Management uses the non-U.S GAAP measure "Net debt" to analyze the amount of debt the Company can incur under its debt policy. Management believes that this policy also provides guidance to credit and equity investors regarding the extent to which the Company would be prepared to leverage its operations. The Company, from time to time enters into debt-related derivatives (DRDs) as a part of its debt management and as part of efficiently managing the Company s overall cost of funds. Creditors and credit rating agencies use net debt adjusted for DRDs in their analyses of the Company s debt, therefore the Company provides this non-U.S. GAAP measure. DRDs are fair value adjustments to the carrying value of the underlying debt. Also included in the DRDs is the unamortized fair value adjustment related to a discontinued fair value hedge that will be amortized over the remaining life of the debt. By adjusting for DRDs, the total financial liability of net debt is disclosed without grossing debt up with currency or interest fair values.

The non-U.S. GAAP measure Net debt is also used in the non-U.S. GAAP measure Leverage ratio . Management uses the non-U.S. GAAP measure Leverage Ratio to analyze the amount of debt the Company can incur under its debt policy. Management believes that this policy also provides guidance to credit and equity investors regarding the extent to which the Company would be prepared to leverage its operations. The Company's long-term target for the leverage ratio (sum of net debt plus pension liabilities divided by EBITDA) is 1.0x with the aim to operate within the range of 0.5x to 1.5x. For details and calculation of leverage ratio, refer to the table below.

As of September 30, 2024, total headcount (Full Time Equivalent) decreased by around 4,000, or by 5.6 , compared to a year earlier, despite almost unchanged sales. The indirect workforce decreased by around 800, or by 4.4 , mainly reflecting our structural reduction initiatives. The direct workforce decreased by approximately 3,100, or by 5.9 , partly due to that an improvement in customer call-off accuracy in the third quarter has enabled us to accelerate operating efficiency improvements. Compared to June 30, 2024, total headcount (FTE) decreased by around 1,500, or by 2.2 . Indirect headcount decreased by around 100, or by 0.6 , while direct headcount decreased by approximately 1,300, or by 2.5 .

PART II - OTH ER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to legal proceedings brought by or against us and our subsidiaries. See Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements, Note 9 Contingent Liabilities" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a summary of certain ongoing legal proceedings. Such information is incorporated into this Part II, Item 1 "Legal Proceedings" by reference. ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS Except for below, as of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the risk factors that were previously disclosed in Item 1A in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024. We may be subject to civil antitrust litigation that could negatively impact our business The Company may be subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the future in countries that permit such civil claims, including lawsuits or other actions by our customers. The Company was previously the subject of an investigation by the European Commission EC regarding possible anti-competitive behavior among certain suppliers to the automotive vehicle industry. The Company paid a fine to resolve these matters in 2019. As a result of the outcome of the EC investigation, we are and we could be, subject to subsequent civil disputes with non-governmental third parties and civil or stockholder litigation stemming from the same facts and circumstances underlying the EC investigation. The Company is currently involved in civil litigation in the UK with respect to alleged anticompetitive behavior that occurred over a decade ago.
