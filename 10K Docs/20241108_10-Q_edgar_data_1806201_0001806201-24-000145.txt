 Credit Agreement Term Loan due 2027 and Revolving Credit Facility 
 On September 9, 2022, the Company entered into a First Amendment to its existing Credit Agreement (the First Amendment with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent, and the financial institutions party thereto, as the lenders. The First Amendment provided the Company senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of million, which (i) established a term loan due 2027 with a principal amount of million (the Term Loan due 2027 ), and (ii) increased the borrowing capacity on the existing revolving credit facility to million (the Revolving Credit Facility ), both scheduled to mature on September 9, 2027 (collectively, the Credit Agreement ). 
 The Company used proceeds from the Term Loan due 2027 to pay off all outstanding amounts under its prior credit agreement and pay transaction costs related to the First Amendment. The remaining proceeds were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The transaction was treated as a debt modification under ASC Topic 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments . 
 The obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by all of the Company s U.S. subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions. 
 Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to either (i) an Alternate Base rate ABR or (ii) the term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus Adjusted SOFR plus a spread that is based upon the Company s total net leverage ratio. The spread ranges from to per annum for ABR loans and to per annum for Adjusted SOFR loans. With respect to the ABR loans, interest will be payable at the end of each calendar quarter. With respect to the Adjusted SOFR loans, interest will be payable at the end of the selected interest period (at least quarterly). Additionally, there is an unused commitment fee payable at the end of each quarter at a rate per annum ranging from to based on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility and other customary letter of credit fees. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the interest rate spread and commitment fees increase or decrease in increments as the Company s Funded Secured Debt/EBITDA ratio increases or decreases. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Credit Agreement was subject to an Adjusted SOFR rate of plus a spread of per annum. Commitment fees were accrued at under the Revolving Credit Facility s unused commitment balance of million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate on the Company s outstanding borrowings was . 
 In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company incurred aggregate deferred financing costs of million, of which (i) million was allocated to the related term loans and capitalized as a contra-liability against the principal balance of the term loans, and (ii) million was allocated to the Revolving Credit Facility and included within Other assets on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These deferred financing costs are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Credit Agreement. Unamortized deferred financing costs related to the Term Loan due 2027 and the Revolving Credit Facility were million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Credit Agreement contains a maximum total net leverage ratio financial covenant and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant, which are tested quarterly. The maximum total net leverage ratio is :1 and the

 million and million, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of and , respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized income tax expense of million and million, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of and , respectively. The Company s income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differs from amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to state income tax expenses, and the officer s compensation limitation under Section 162(m). The decrease in effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 is primarily due to decreased income before income taxes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has assessed whether it is more likely than not that the Company s deferred tax assets will be realized. In making this determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence and makes certain assumptions. The Company considers, among other things, the reversal of its deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, its historical earnings and losses, current industry trends and its outlook for future years. The Company believes it is more-likely-than-not all deferred tax assets will be realized and has not recorded any valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a receivable of million related to a state income tax refund claim filed for a prior tax year. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits includes million of tax expense associated with these refund claims and tax uncertainties in various state jurisdictions due to the complexity of applying evolving state tax laws and uncertainties with respect to sustaining the Company s refund claims. The Company believes it is not reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change during the next twelve months.

 The carrying amount of the Company s debt approximates its fair value due to its variable interest rate. The fair value was determined using the Adjusted SOFR as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 plus an applicable spread, a Level 2 classification in the fair value hierarchy. 
 The Company s accounting policy is to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy on the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. There were no transfers into or out of any level for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Business Overview 
 We are a leading provider of lending enablement and risk analytics to credit unions, regional banks, finance companies and the captive finance companies of automakers. Our customers, collectively referred to herein as automotive lenders, make automotive consumer loans to underserved near-prime and non-prime borrowers by harnessing our risk-based interest rate pricing models, powered by our proprietary data and real-time underwriting of automotive loan default insurance coverage from insurers. Since our inception in 2000, we have facilitated over 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 24.3 billion in automotive loans, accumulated more than 20 years of proprietary data and developed over two million unique risk profiles. We currently serve 406 active lenders. 
 We specialize in risk-based pricing and modeling and provide automated decision-technology for automotive lenders throughout the U.S. We target the financing needs of near-prime and non-prime borrowers, or borrowers with a credit bureau score generally between 560 and 699, who are underserved in the automotive finance industry. Traditional lenders focus on prime borrowers, where an efficient market has developed with interest rate competition that benefits borrowers. Independent finance companies focus on sub-prime borrowers. Borrowers who must utilize the near-prime and non-prime automotive lending market have fewer lenders focused on loans with longer terms or higher advance rates. As a result, many near-prime and non-prime borrowers turn to sub-prime lenders, resulting in higher interest rate loan offerings than such borrower s credit profile often merits or warrants. We seek to make this market more competitive, resulting in more attractive loan terms. 
 Our flagship product, LPP, is a cloud-based automotive lending enablement platform. LPP supports loans made to near-prime and non-prime borrowers and is designed to underwrite default insurance by linking automotive lenders to our insurance partners. The platform uses risk-based pricing models which enable automotive lenders to assess the credit risk of a potential borrower using data driven analysis. Our proprietary risk models project loan performance, including expected losses and prepayments in arriving at the optimal contract interest rate. With five-second decisioning, LPP recommends a risk-based, all-inclusive interest rate for a loan that is customized to each automotive lender, reflecting cost of capital, loan servicing and acquisition costs, expected recovery rates and target return on assets. LPP risk models use a proprietary score in assessing and pricing risk on automotive loan applications. This score combines credit bureau data and Fair Credit Reporting Act-compliant alternative consumer data to more effectively assess risk and determine the appropriate insurance premium for any given loan application. 
 LPP is powered by technology that delivers speed and scalability in providing interest rate decisioning to automotive lenders. It supports the full transaction lifecycle, including credit application, underwriting, real-time insurance approval, settlement, servicing, invoicing of insurance premiums and fees and advance data analytics of the automotive lender s portfolio under the program. Through electronic system integration, our software technology connects us to parties in our ecosystem. 
 A key element of LPP is the unique database that drives risk decisioning using data accumulated for more than 20 years. When a loan is insured at origination, all attributes of the transaction are stored in our database. Through the claims management process, we ultimately obtain loan life performance data on each insured loan. Having granular origination and performance data allows our data scientists and actuaries to constantly evolve and refine risk models, based on actual experience and third-party information sources. 
 We believe the automotive industry is still seeking solutions to address the near-prime and non-prime borrower market. The near-prime and non-prime automotive loan origination market is a large, underserved sector, estimated at 270 billion annually. We currently serve approximately 1 of this market, providing a significant growth opportunity. In addition, our market opportunity related to the refinancing of near-prime and non-prime automotive loans is estimated at 40 billion annually.

 Highlights 
 The table below summarizes the dollar value of insured loans facilitated and the number of new contracts we signed with automotive lenders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Certified loans 27,435 29,959 84,587 96,721 Value of insured loans facilitated (in thousands) 772,469 883,470 2,379,621 2,850,133 Average loan size per certified loan 28,156 29,489 28,132 29,468 Number of contracts signed with automotive lenders 21 8 45 29 
 We define active lenders as lenders who certify at least one loan during the preceding 12 months. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 406 and 463 active lenders, respectively. The table below represents lender count information for lenders with certified loan activity during the periods indicated.

 (2) Net change in the number of lenders previously onboarded who use LPP to certify loans during the period. Certain lenders experience periods of inactivity followed by periods of activity, causing the lender count to fluctuate from period to period. 

Key Performance Measures 
 We review several key performance measures, discussed below, to evaluate business and results, measure performance, identify trends, formulate plans and make strategic decisions. We believe that the presentation of such metrics is useful to our investors and counterparties because such metrics are used to measure and model the performance of similar companies, with recurring revenue streams. 
 Certified Loans 
 We refer to certified loans as the loans facilitated through LPP during a given period. Additionally, we refer to loans with a one-time upfront program fee payment as single-pay loans. For certain loans, the program fee is paid to us over 12 monthly installments and we refer to these loans as monthly-pay loans. 
 Average Program Fee 
 We define average program fee as the total program fee revenue recognized for a period divided by the number of certified loans in that period. 
 Underwriting Profit 
 We define underwriting profit as the total underwriting profit expected to be received by insurers over the expected life of the certified loans.

 Earned Premium 
 We define earned premium as the total insurance premium earned by insurers in a given period. Earned premiums were 83.7 million and 253.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 85.6 million and 249.1 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 Our future operating results and cash flows are dependent upon a number of opportunities, challenges and other factors, including the growth in the number of financial institutions and transaction volume, competition, profit share assumptions and industry trends and general economic conditions. Key factors affecting our operating results include the following: 
 Growth in the Number of Financial Institutions 
 The growth trend in active automotive lenders using LPP is a critical factor directly affecting revenue and financial results as it influences the number of loans funded on LPP. Growth in our active automotive lender relationships will depend on our ability to retain existing automotive lenders and add new ones. 
 Competition 
 We face competition to acquire and maintain automotive lenders as customers, as well as competition to facilitate the funding of near-prime and non-prime auto loans. LPP, which combines lending enablement, risk analytics, near-prime and non-prime auto loan performance data, real-time loan decisioning, risk-based pricing and auto loan default insurance, is a unique solution for which we have not identified any direct competitors. The emergence of direct competitors, providing risk, analytics and loss mitigation, which are core elements of our business, could materially impact our ability to acquire and maintain automotive lender customers. The near-prime and non-prime lending market is highly fragmented and competitive. We face competition from a diverse landscape of consumer lenders, including traditional banks and credit unions, as well as alternative technology-enabled lenders. The emergence of other insurers, in competition with our insurers, could materially impact our business. 
 Profit Share Assumptions 
 We rely on assumptions to calculate the value of profit share revenue, which is our share of insurance partners underwriting profit. For example, positive change in estimates associated with historic vintages generate an increase in our contract asset, additional revenues and future expected cash flows, while negative change in estimates generate a decrease in our contract asset, a reduction in revenues and future expected cash flows. Please refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for more information on these assumptions. 
 Industry Trends and General Economic Conditions 
 Our results of operations have been and may continue to be impacted by the relative strength of the overall economy and its effect on unemployment, consumer spending, consumer demand for automotive financing and our lender customer s liquidity. As general economic conditions improve or deteriorate, the amount of disposable income consumers have tends to fluctuate, which in turn impacts consumer spending levels and the willingness of consumers to enter into loans to finance purchases and consumers ability to afford financial obligations. Specific economic factors such as inflation, rising interest rate levels, changes in monetary and related policies, market volatility, supply chain disruptions, consumer confidence and, particularly, the unemployment rate also influence consumer spending and borrowing patterns. 
 Concentration 
 The Company s largest insurance partner accounted for 35 of the Company s total revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s largest insurance partners accounted for 29 and 10 of the Company's total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 32 and 11 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Termination or disruption of these relationships could materially and adversely impact our revenue. See Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business If we lose one or more of our insurance carriers and are unable to replace their commitments, it could have a material adverse effect on our business in our Annual Report. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Total Revenues 
 Our revenue is generated through three streams: (i) program fees paid to us by automotive lenders, (ii) profit share paid to us by insurance partners and (iii) claims administration service fees paid to us by insurance partners. 
 Program fees . Program fees are paid by automotive lenders for the use of LPP, which provides loan analytics solutions and automated issuance of credit default insurance with third-party insurance providers. These fees are based on a percentage of each certified loan s original principal balance and are recognized as revenue upfront upon certification of the loan by the lending institution. The fee percentage rate varies based on the agreement with each lender. For loans with a one-time upfront payment, there is a sliding scale of rates representing volume discounts for certain lenders. Fees are calculated as a percentage of the funded loan amount and may be subject to a cap. For monthly-pay loans, the fee paid by the lender is typically 3 of the initial amount of the loan and is not capped. 
 Profit share. Profit share represents our participation in the underwriting profit of third-party insurance partners who provide automotive lenders with credit default insurance on loans those lenders make using LPP. We receive a percentage of the aggregate monthly insurance underwriting profit. Monthly insurance underwriting profit is calculated as the monthly earned premium less expenses and losses (including reserves for incurred but not reported losses), with losses accrued and carried forward to future profit share calculations. 
 Claims administration service fees. Claims administration service fees are paid to us by third-party insurance partners for credit default insurance claims adjudication services performed by our subsidiary, Insurance Administrative Services, LLC, on its insured servicing portfolio. The administration fee is equal to 3 of the monthly insurance earned premium for as long as the LPP certified loan remains outstanding. 
 Cost of Services and Operating Expenses 
 Cost of services. Cost of services primarily consists of fees paid to third-party partners for lead-generation efforts, compensation and benefit expenses relating to employees engaged in automotive lender customer service, product support and claims administration activities, fees paid for actuarial services related to the development of the monthly premium program, fees for integration with the loan origination systems of automotive lenders and fees paid to credit bureaus and data service providers for credit applicant data. In the near term, we generally expect cost of services to remain constant as a percentage of our program fee revenue. 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of expenses relating to corporate-level employee compensation and benefits, non-cash share-based compensation, travel, meals and entertainment expenses, data and software expenses and professional and consulting fees. In the near term, we expect general and administrative expenses to remain constant. 
 Selling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits of employees engaged in selling and marketing activities. We generally expect selling and marketing expenses to remain constant as a percentage of our program fee revenue in the near term. 
 Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits of employees engaged in ongoing research and development. We generally expect our research and development expenses to remain constant in the near term. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Interest expense . Interest expense primarily includes interest payments and the amortization of deferred financing costs in connection with the issuance of our debt. 
 Interest income . Interest income primarily includes interest earned on money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities.

 Total revenue decreased by 2.5 million, or 10 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, driven by a 1.2 million decrease in profit share revenue and a 1.3 million decrease in program fees. 
 Total revenue decreased by 21.6 million, or 21 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, driven by a 14.4 million decrease in profit share revenue and a 7.3 million decrease in program fees, which was partially offset by increased claims administration and other service fee revenues of 0.1 million. 
 Program fees revenue decreased by 1.3 million, or 8 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 driven by an 8 decrease in certified loan volume. 
 Program fees revenue decreased by 7.3 million, or 14 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in program fees revenue was driven by a 13 decrease in certified loan volume and a 3 decrease in unit economics per certified loan. 
 Profit share revenue decreased by 1.2 million, or 15 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Profit share revenue associated with new certified loan originations decreased 2.3 million, or 14 , primarily due to an 8 decrease in certified loans and a 7 decrease in unit economics during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Profit share revenue associated with change in estimate increased 1.1 million, or 14 , during those same periods. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 13.8 million in anticipated profit share associated with 27,435 new certified loans for an average of 502 per loan as compared to 16.1 million in anticipated profit share associated with 29,959 certified loans for an average of 537 per loan during the three months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a reduction of 7.0 million in profit share revenue related to business in historic vintages. Of the 7.0 million, 4.0 million is primarily due to higher than anticipated loan defaults, partially offset by lower than anticipated severity of losses. The incremental 3.0 million reduction in profit share revenue represents an estimated, non-recurring liability for future claim payments and previous profit share receipts. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a decrease of 8.1 million in profit share revenue related to business in historic vintages primarily due to higher than anticipated prepayments and loan defaults, partially offset by lower than anticipated severity of losses. 
 Profit share revenue decreased by 14.4 million, or 32 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.

 share associated with 96,721 certified loans for an average of 547 per loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a reduction of 14.8 million in profit share revenue related to business in historic vintages. Of the 14.8 million, 11.8 million is primarily due to higher than anticipated loan defaults, partially offset by lower than anticipated severity of losses. The incremental 3.0 million reduction in profit share revenue represents an estimated, non-recurring liability for future claim payments and previous profit share receipts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a reduction of 8.5 million in profit share revenue related to business in historic vintages primarily due to higher than anticipated prepayments and loan defaults, partially offset by lower than anticipated severity of losses. 
 Revenue from claims administration and other service fees decreased by 0.1 million, or 3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a 2 decrease in total earned premiums during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Revenue from claims administration and other service fees increased 0.1 million, or 2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a 2 increase in total earned premiums during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year.

 General and administrative expenses decreased by 0.3 million, or 3 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily driven by a decrease in employee compensation and benefit costs due to a decrease in the bonus accrual. General and administrative expenses increased by 2.3 million, or 7 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period last year primarily driven by higher employee compensation and benefit costs of 3.5 million partially offset by decreased business taxes of 0.8 million due to non-recurring events in 2023. 
 Selling and marketing expenses increased by 0.4 million and 0.1 million, or 9 and 1 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by higher employee compensation and benefit costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these increased costs were partially offset by a 0.3 million decrease in direct marketing expenses. 
 Research and development expenses decreased 0.7 million, or 42 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Research and development expenses decreased by 0.5 million, or 12 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increased focus on product support and the development of internal use software. 
 Operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 2.7 million and 24.2 million, or 59 and 65 , respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, primarily driven by decreases in total revenues as well as changes in operating expenses, as discussed above. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased 0.2 million, or 6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Interest expense increased 0.6 million, or 8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. For both periods, interest expense increased as a result of higher borrowing costs during 2024. 
 Interest Income 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income increased 0.4 million and 2.0 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest earned on U.S. Treasury Securities and Money Market accounts. 
 Income Taxes 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized income tax expense of 0.7 million and 1.5 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 32.4 and 33.8 , respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized income tax expense of 4.6 million and 9.9 million, respectively, with effective tax rates of 32.6 and 26.9 , respectively. 
 Income tax expense decreased 0.8 million and 5.3 million, or 55 and 54 , respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the decrease in income before income taxes. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flow and Liquidity Analysis 
 We assess liquidity primarily in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating and investing activities. A significant portion of our cash from operating activities is derived from our profit share arrangements with our insurance partners, which are subject to judgments and assumptions and is, therefore, subject to variability. We believe that our existing cash resources and the Revolving Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our near-term working capital needs. We regularly evaluate alternatives for managing our capital structure and liquidity profile in consideration of expected cash flows, growth and operating capital requirements and capital market conditions. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in this Quarterly Report and our Annual Report for a full description of the related estimates, assumptions and judgments. 
 Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets (as described in Risk Factors in our Annual Report), there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or 
 25

 uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
 The following table provides a summary of cash flow data: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 20,976 65,903 Net cash used in investing activities (2,738) (1,588) Net cash used in financing activities (3,960) (34,423) 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Our cash flows provided by operating activities reflect net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
 The following table summarizes the non-cash adjustments in the operating activities in the unaudited Condensed Statement of Cash Flows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net income 9,426 26,912 Non-cash adjustments 13,020 8,816 Non-cash (gains) losses 37 10 Change in contract assets (10,594) 26,199 Change in other assets and liabilities 9,087 3,966 Net cash provided by operating activities 20,976 65,903 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 44.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased cash collections of 58.8 million related to reduced profit share, program fees and claims administration service fee revenues, and 2.0 million increase in interest expense payments. The decrease in cash was offset by a 9.8 million reduction in income tax payments, 2.0 million increase in interest income received, 1.8 million decrease in cash payments related to cost of services and operating expenses and 2.3 million reduction in working capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 2.7 million and 1.6 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the investments were primarily related to internal use software development costs. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Our cash flows used in financing activities primarily consist of share repurchases, payments of debt and deferred financing costs. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 3.9 million which includes a 2.8 million principal payment on our Term Loan due 2027 and 1.1 million for shares withheld for payroll taxes associated with the vesting of restricted stock awards. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 34.4 million and is primarily related to the repurchase of 4,296,927 shares of our common stock held in treasury stock for a total of 31.3 million, excluding excise tax, as well as 2.8 million principal payment on our Term Loan due 2027.

Table of Contents 

 Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and 141.5 million outstanding under our Term Loan due 2027. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 The Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program ), allowing the Company to repurchase up to 75.0 million of the Company s outstanding common stock until March 31, 2024. Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, the Company repurchased 5,233,065 and 2,643,306 shares at an average price of 7.13 and 6.82 for a total of 37.3 million and 18.0 million, excluding excise tax, during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These shares were recorded to Treasury stock, at cost in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which includes 0.3 million of excise tax paid in October 2024. This excise tax payable is included within A ccrued expenses in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Dividends 
 Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants in our existing indebtedness and may be limited by the agreements governing other indebtedness that we or our subsidiaries may incur in the future. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate its operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Accordingly, we believe these measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. These measures further provide useful analysis of period-to-period comparisons of our business, as they exclude the effect of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income excluding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment and share-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of total revenue. 
 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated: 
 Adjusted EBITDA Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net income 1,437 3,003 9,426 26,912 Non-GAAP adjustments: Interest expense 2,962 2,799 8,468 7,841 Income tax expense 688 1,532 4,563 9,907 Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets 494 328 1,281 824 Share-based compensation 2,186 2,663 6,408 6,826 Total adjustments 6,330 7,322 20,720 25,398 Adjusted EBITDA 7,767 10,325 30,146 52,310 Total revenue 23,476 26,006 80,948 102,521 Adjusted EBITDA margin 33 40 37 51

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 2.6 million and 22.2 million, or 25 and 42 , respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 33 as compared to 40 during the same period in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 37 as compared to 51 during the same period in 2023. 
 The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects our reduced revenue due to lower certified loan volume and the impact of profit share revenue change in estimate as well as increased cost of services and operating expenses during each period.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our operations include activities in the U.S. These operations expose us to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates and changes in consumer attitudes toward financing a vehicle purchase. We monitor and manage these financial exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. 
 Market Risk 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk and have established policies designed to protect against the adverse effects of this exposure. We are exposed to risks associated with general economic conditions and the impact of the economic environment on consumer spending levels, the willingness of consumers to enter into loans to finance purchases and consumers ability to afford financial obligations. Consumer spending and borrowing patterns related to auto purchases are influenced by economic factors such as unemployment rates, inflation, rising interest rate levels, changes in monetary and related policies, market volatility and overall consumer confidence. We also face risk from competition to acquire, maintain and develop new relationships with automotive lenders as well as competition from a wide variety of automotive lenders who are (or are affiliated) with financial institutions and have capacity to hold loans on their balance sheets. 
 Concentration Risk 
 We rely on our three largest insurance partners for a significant portion of our profit share and claims administration service fee revenue. Termination or disruption of these relationships could materially and adversely impact our revenue. See Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business If we lose one or more of our insurance carriers and are unable to replace their commitments, it could have a material adverse effect on our business in our Annual Report. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates on investment of available cash balances in money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities. Our Term Loan due 2027 also exposes us to changes in short-term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding amounts of 142.5 million under the Term Loan due 2027, which is scheduled to mature on September 9, 2027. There were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to Adjusted SOFR plus a spread that is based upon our total net leverage ratio. The spread ranges from 1.625 to 2.375 per annum for Adjusted SOFR loans. We are also charged an unused commitment fee that ranges from 0.15 to 0.225 per annum on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which is paid quarterly in arrears and is based on our total net leverage ratio.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, regardless of how well they were designed and are operating, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
