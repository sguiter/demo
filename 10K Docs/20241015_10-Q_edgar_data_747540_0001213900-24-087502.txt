ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

This report contains forward-looking
statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained herein, including statements regarding our future results
of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking
statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance
or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements. Furthermore, we cannot at this time assess the affect that the global outbreak of the novel Coronavirus may have on the Company. 

In some cases, forward-looking
statements can be identified by terms such as may, will, should, expects, plans, 
 anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, 
 believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative
of these terms or other similar words. These statements are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on
our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations. We discuss many of the risks in greater detail under the heading Risk Factors in our most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Also, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of the
filing of this report. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of the
filing of this report. 

Overview 

The Company operates with
two sales groups, Surge Components Surge and Challenge Electronics Challenge ). Surge is a supplier of electronic
products and components. These products include capacitors, which are electrical energy storage devices, and discrete semiconductor components,
such as rectifiers, transistors and diodes, which are single function low power semiconductor products that are packaged alone as compared
to integrated circuits such as microprocessors. The products sold by Surge are typically utilized in the electronic circuitry of diverse
products, including, but not limited to, automobiles, audio products, temperature control products, lighting products, energy related
products, computer related products, various types of consumer products, garage door openers, household appliances, power supplies and
security equipment. These products are sold to both original equipment manufacturers, commonly referred to as OEMs, who incorporate them
into their products, and to distributors of the lines of products we sell, who resell these products within their customer base. These
products are manufactured predominantly in Asia by approximately sixteen independent manufacturers. We act as the master distribution
agent utilizing independent sales representative organizations in North America to sell and market the products for one such manufacturer
pursuant to a written agreement. When we act as a sales agent, our supplier who sold the product to the customer that we introduced to
our supplier pays us a commission. The amount of the commission is determined on a sale by sale basis depending on the profit margin of
the product. Commission revenue totaled 73,235 and 135,130 for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023 respectively. 

Challenge is engaged
in the sale of electronic components. In 1999, Challenge began as a division to sell audible components. We have been able to increase
the types of products that we sell because some of our suppliers introduced new products, and we also located other products from new
suppliers. Our core products include buzzers, speakers, microphones, resonators, alarms, chimes, filters, and discriminators. We now also
work with our suppliers to have our suppliers customize many of the products we sell for many customers through the customers own
designs and those that we work with our suppliers to have our suppliers redesign for them at our suppliers factories. We have engineers
on our staff who work with our suppliers on such redesigns and assists with the introduction of new product lines. We are continually
looking to expand the line of products that we sell. We sell these products through independent representatives that earn a commission
on the products we sell. We are also working with local, regional, and national distributors to sell these products to local accounts
in every state. Challenge also at times handles the brokering of certain products, helping its customers find parts that regular suppliers
can t deliver. 

The Company has a Hong Kong
office to effectively handle the transfer business from United States customers purchasing and manufacturing in Asia after designing the
products in the United States. This office has strengthened the Company s global position, improving our capabilities and service
to our customer base.

The world of business continues
to change. Customers continue to centralize purchasing from regional purchasing and are stretching their payment terms. These changes
also include customers moving their manufacturing operations from North America to Asia, and the trend of globalization. Some of our customers
have been involved in mergers and acquisitions, causing consolidation. This trend makes business more complicated and costly for the Company.
The Company must have a presence in Asia to service and further develop the business. For these reasons, we established Surge Ltd., our
Hong Kong subsidiary. Currency fluctuations may also have an effect on doing business outside of North America. Customers have moved to
reduce their supply chain, which could adversely affect the Company. In some market segments, demand for electronic components has decreased,
and in other segments, the demand is still strong. Some technologies have become obsolete, while customers develop new products using
different kinds of components. One division in the Company has had success in designing new products for customers to better their products
performance capabilities. This proactive approach separates the Company from selling commodity products to also selling more customized
products. Management expects the remainder of 2024 to continue to be a period of continued challenge, in regard to inflation and general
economic conditions, in maintaining consistent flow of products during shortages of certain products, and growth, as we see our customers
change their manufacturing and buying practices. These challenges could affect the Company in negative ways, possibly reducing sales and
or profitability. Because of a labor shortage, our customers , engineering staff has been challenged, so getting our products approved
has been and will continue to take longer to achieve. Additionally, if costs of raw materials continues to increase, our costs have increased.
In order for the Company to continue to grow, we will depend on, among other things, the continued growth of the electronics and semiconductor
industries, our ability to withstand intense price competition, our ability to obtain new customers, our ability to retain and attract
good sales and other key personnel in order to expand our marketing capabilities, our ability to secure adequate sources of products,
which are in demand on commercially reasonable terms, our success in executing and managing growth, including monitoring an expanded level
of operations and systems, controlling costs, the availability of adequate cash flow, the continued supply of products from our factories,
the ability to withstand higher transportation costs and longer travel times. The tariffs continue to impact the Company, although less
now then previously. Supply chain challenges can present both a challenge and opportunity to the Company. The Company is cautiously optimistic
about its ability to meet these challenges with continued growth unless the general global or electronics industry economic conditions
deteriorate. Financial news has been talking about the decreases in consumer demand which could impact negatively the demand for the Company s
products, as the customers are producing less of their products. These economic conditions could have a negative impact on sales into
2025. The combination of possible increased costs and longer lead times from factories to the Company could also have negative impacts
on the business in the future. The tense relations between America and China could also impact the Company s business. China could
impose rules and laws that make it more difficult to do business in Hong Kong and China. The Company is taking steps to be well prepared
in case of any actions from China that would cause us business disruption. For example, many of the Company s factory partners have
opened production facilities outside of China. As economic conditions have deteriorated, it has impacted the Company s business.
Customers at the end of 2022 had started to push back delivery dates, and in some cases required cancellations because they over ordered,
creating a significant excess inventory. We are watching closely as customers slowly consume their excess inventory levels that reflect
this new business demand, and the Company will respond accordingly. This consumption of inventory by the customers is taking longer than
expected. As of the end of the first quarter of 2024 we have seen some customers begin to start ordering products again. We expect to
see customers getting back to normal ordering levels by the second half of 2025. The three main United States automotive companies, GM, Ford and Stellantis, are experiencing major headwinds due to over inventory at
dealerships and competition from the automakers in China. This could have a negative impact on the Company s overall activity in
the automotive market segment. A dock workers strike was threatened for the docks along the east coast of America. It has been tentatively
settled until January 2025. If the strike should start again, it could negatively impact the Company s business, as we won t
be able to receive shipments from our factories that were in transit. President Biden announced that the United States will increase tariffs on certain products coming in from China from 25 to 50 . This
includes some of Surge s products and could have negative impacts on the business. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Accounts Receivable 

The allowance for credit losses
is based on the Company s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and an assessment of international, political
and economic risk as well as the aging of the accounts receivable. If there is a change in actual defaults from the Company s historical
experience, the Company s estimates of recoverability of amounts due could be affected and the Company would adjust the allowance
accordingly. 

Revenue Recognition 

Revenue is recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed and determinable, collectability is reasonably
assured and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer. This occurs when product is shipped from the Company s
warehouse. For direct shipments from our suppliers to our customer, revenue is recognized when product is shipped from the Company s
supplier. The Company acts as a sales agent for certain customers buying direct from one of its suppliers. The Company reports these commissions
as revenues in the period earned. 

20 

The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers and maintains reserves for potential credit losses. 

Inventory Valuation 

Inventories are recorded at
the lower of cost or net realizable value. Write-downs of inventories to net realizable value are based on stock rotation, historical
sales requirements and obsolescence as well as in the changes in the backlog. Reserves required for obsolescence were not material in
any of the periods in the financial statements presented. Reserves related to stock rotation and future sales requirements for specific
inventory parts involve subjective estimates to be made by management based on current and expected market conditions. If market conditions
are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs of inventories could be required. For example, each additional
1 of obsolete inventory would reduce operating income by approximately 62,000. 

The Company does not have
price protection agreements with any of its vendors and assumes the risk of changes in the prices of its products. The Company does not
believe there to be a significant risk with regards to the lack of price protection agreements as many of its inventory items are purchased
to fulfill purchase orders received. 

Income Taxes 

We have made a number of estimates
and assumptions relating to the reporting of a deferred income tax asset to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. These estimates may have a significant impact on our valuation allowance relating to deferred income taxes.
Our estimates could materially impact the financial statements. 

Results of Operations 

Consolidated net sales for
the nine months ended August 31, 2024 decreased by 5,879,836 or 20.8 , to 22,369,017 as compared to net sales of 28,248,853 for the
nine months ended August 31, 2023. Consolidated net sales for the three months ended August 31, 2024 decreased by 887,543 or 10.0 , to
 7,970,316 as compared to net sales of 8,857,859 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. We attribute the decrease to a decrease
in business with new customers as well as a decrease in business with existing customers. We can also attribute the decrease to customers
pushing out orders due to them over ordering in 2022. The customers have excess inventory that they need to consume before re-ordering
those products. Additionally, many customers, because of having this excess inventory have not launched new product development as their
cash is tied up in their inventory. Net sales for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023 reflect 386,343 and 872,224,
respectively of tariff costs that the Company was able to pass on to its customers. 

Our gross profit for the nine
months ended August 31, 2024 decreased by 1,334,498 to 6,532,263, or 17 , as compared to 7,866,761 for the nine months ended August
31, 2023. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 29.2 for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 27.8 for
the nine months ended August 31, 2023. Gross profit for the three months ended August 31, 2024 increased by 191,569 to 2,487,570, or
8.3 , as compared to 2,296,001 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 31.2 
for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 25.9 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease in gross profit
for the nine months ending August 31, 2024 can be attributed to decreases in sales from some of our higher margin customers. The increase
in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the nine and three months ended August 31, 2024 can be attributed to increases in sales from
customers whose sales carry a higher profit margin. Our industry will continue to receive pressure from customers for price reductions.
Some of them further demand periodic price reductions on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, as opposed to annual fixed pricing. We work
with electronic manufacturing service subcontractor customers who manufacture products for other customers who do not have their own manufacturing
operations. At times we are not able to recover these price reductions from our suppliers. The Company has agreements with these subcontractor
customers to provide periodic cost reductions through rebates in the amount of 5 . These reductions only affect future shipments
of our products, and do not affect existing orders. These reductions can have a negative impact on our profit margins since they reduce
the amount of commissions we can earn. Even though this rebate can impact the Company s gross profit margin, these subcontractor
customers represent very significant potential growth for the Company, because they can help the Company become an approved supplier at
the customers they manufacture for, and they purchase our components for these customers. We believe it would be very difficult for the
Company to achieve business at these customers without the help of these subcontractor customers. During the nine months ended August
31, 2024, the Company was impacted by tariff costs on certain products imported from China, which went into effect as of July 6, 2018.
The Company has been able to pass along a portion of these costs to its customers. The Company is also moving some customer deliveries
directly to Hong Kong in order to mitigate some of these costs.

Selling and shipping expenses
for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 was 2,028,864, a decrease of 230,881, or 10.2 , as compared to 2,259,745 for the nine months
ended August 31, 2024. Selling and shipping expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was 683,894, a decrease of 65,026, or
8.7 , as compared to 748,920 for three months ended August 31, 2023. We attribute the decrease to decreases in sales and the resulting
selling expenses such as commission expenses, travel expenses, and trade show expenses, offset by increases in salesman payroll due to
hiring of additional sales employees in the nine months ended August 31, 2024, as well as entertainment, freight out and auto expenses. 

General and administrative
expenses for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 was 3,887,238, a decrease of 219,049, or 5.3 , as compared to 4,106,287 for the
nine months ended August 31, 2023. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was 1,250,294, a decrease
of 66,310, or 5.0 as compared to 1,316,604 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease is due primarily to decreases in
officer salaries for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 as well as health and rent and general insurance expenses, as well as temporary
help expenses, directors fees and consulting expenses as partially offset by increases in salaries and related payroll tax expenses, telephone,
office expenses and professional fees and bank charges as well as public company expenses and officer salaries for the three months ended
August 31, 2024. 

Depreciation expense for the
nine months ended August 31, 2024 was 52,788, an increase of 272, or less than 1.0 , as compared to 52,516 for the nine months ended
August 31, 2023. Depreciation expense for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was 18,020, an increase of 515, or 2.9 , as compared
to 17,505 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. 

Other income for the nine
months ended August 31, 2024 was 241,300, an increase of 179,156 as compared to 62,144 for the nine months ended August 31, 2023. Other
income for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was 88,120, an increase of 55,242 as compared to 32,878 for the three months ended
August 31, 2023. We attribute the increase to income the investment in the acquisition of Treasury Bonds and notes issued by the United
States Treasury. 

Tax expense for the nine months
ended August 31, 2024 was 234,383, a decrease of 233,273 as compared to a tax expense of 457,656 for the nine months ended August 31,
2023. Tax expense for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was 179,130, a decrease of 66,560 as compared to tax expense of 112,570
for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decreases result from our decrease in net income for the 2024 period. 

As a result of the foregoing,
net income for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 was 570,290 compared to net income of 1,052,701 for the nine months ended August
31, 2023. The net income for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was 444,352, compared to a net income of 133,280 for the three months
ended August 31, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of August 31, 2024 we had
cash of 4,416,717, marketable securities of 7,822,358, and working capital of 18,744,108. We believe that our working capital levels
are adequate to meet our operating requirements during the next twelve months. The Company is exploring and evaluating opportunities for
growth and expansion using the Company s cash and marketable securities resources, including hiring new sales managers to help to
grow the business as well as opening up new offices globally and expanding the Company s existing offices. In addition, The Company
believes that during these hard economic times the Company should ensure it has sufficient cash flow to support the business until the
anticipated turnaround in 2025. 

During the nine months ended
August 31, 2024, we had net cash flow provided by operating activities of 954,964, as compared to net cash flow provided by operating
activities of 1,269,583 for the nine months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities was primarily
the result of lower net income and accrued expenses and an increase in inventory, as partially offset by lower accounts receivable and
higher accounts payable. 

We had net cash flow used
in investing activities of (4,443,046) for the nine months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to net cash flow used in investing activities
of (4,002,538) for the nine months ended August 31, 2023. We attribute the change to the acquisition of 6,052,055 of Treasury bills
and notes issued by the United States Treasury and the acquisition of fixed assets, as partially offset by the proceeds from maturing
Treasury bills and notes of approximately 1,620,000. 

We had net cash flow provided
by financing activities of 0 during the nine months ended August 31, 2024 as compared to 0 for the nine months ended August 31, 2023. 

22 

As a result of the foregoing,
including investing excess cash into short term treasury bills, the Company had a net decrease in cash of (3,488,082) for nine months
ended August 31, 2024, as compared to a net decrease in cash of 2,732,955 for the nine months ended August 31, 2023.
