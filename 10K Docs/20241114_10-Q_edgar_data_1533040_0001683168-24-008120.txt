The
Company will pay to AgonOx all Company payment obligations that accrued prior to the termination of the Clinical Co-Development Agreement.
Remaining payments to be made to AgonOx as of September 30, 2024 were 35,000, which primarily related to remaining accrued obligations
for patient fees and other miscellaneous costs as of the date of termination. Pursuant to the terms of the Clinical Co-Development Agreement,

stock in abeyance. Accordingly, an aggregate of shares of common stock were held in abeyance (the July 2024 Abeyance

holder. Until such time, the Abeyance Shares were evidenced through the holder s existing warrants and have been included in the
Company s table of outstanding warrants below. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, of the July 2024 Abeyance
Shares were released. The remainder of the July 2024 Abeyance Shares were subsequently released in October 2024.

the amendments to the exercise price of the warrants under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC
815 and determined that the amendment to the exercise price was completed in connection with and contingent on the close of

of the Company s existing warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 236,695 shares of the Company s common stock (the December
2023 Financing ). Pursuant to the terms of the December 2023 Inducement Letter Agreement, in the event that the exercise of
the existing warrants in the December 2023 Financing would have otherwise caused a holder to exceed the beneficial ownership limitations
set forth in the existing warrant, the Company issued the number of shares that would not cause a holder to exceed such beneficial ownership
limitation and agreed to hold such balance of shares of common stock in abeyance. Accordingly, an aggregate of 91,820 shares of common
stock were held in abeyance (the December 2023 Abeyance Shares with such December 2023 Abeyance Shares evidenced
through the holder s existing warrants and which were deemed to be prepaid. The December 2023 Abeyance Shares were held until notice

limitations and were exercised pursuant to a notice of exercise from the holder. Until such time, the December 2023 Abeyance Shares were
evidenced through the holder s existing warrants and have been included in the Company s table of outstanding warrants below.

would have otherwise caused a holder to exceed the beneficial ownership limitations set forth in the existing warrant, the Company issued
the number of shares that would not cause a holder to exceed such beneficial ownership limitation and agreed to hold such balance of shares

the Company s table of outstanding warrants below. The remainder of the December 2023 Abeyance Shares were subsequently released during the first quarter of 2024. 

Warrants 

The Company first assesses
warrants that are issued by the Company under the FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC
480 to determine whether the warrants are within the scope of ASC 480. If there are no instances outside of the Company s
control that could require cash settlement, the Company then applies and follows the applicable accounting guidance in ASC 815. Financial
instruments are accounted for as either derivative liabilities or equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the agreement.
Based on the assessment of the warrants issued by the Company under the guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815, the warrants issued by the Company
have been classified within stockholder s equity. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, of the July 2024 Abeyance Shares were released and issued. During the three months
ended September 30, 2023, shares of common stock were issued related to the exercise of pre-funded warrants from the June 2023
Financing.

Abeyance Shares were released and issued. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, shares of common stock were issued related
to the exercise of pre-funded warrants from the June 2023 Financing.

year after the grant date. Upon vesting, each outstanding RSU will be settled for one share of the Company s common stock.
Employee RSU recipients may elect to net share settle upon vesting, in which case the Company pays the employee s income taxes
due upon vesting and withholds a number of shares of equal value. The Company does not expect to repurchase shares to satisfy RSU vests.
The fair value of the RSUs awarded are based upon the Company s closing stock price at the grant date and are expensed over the
requisite service period. 

On September 11, 2024, the
Company modified all unvested RSUs to reduce the vesting term for employees from 3 years after the grant date to 1 year after the grant
date. No incremental expense was recognized as a result of the modification, as the fair value of the RSUs immediately before and after
the modification was unchanged.

subject to graded vesting and the satisfaction of service requirements. Stock options granted by the Company to employees generally vest
annually over years after the grant date and generally vest over year after the grant date for non-employee members of the Board of
Directors and expire within ten years of grant. Upon the exercise of a stock option, the Company issues new shares and delivers them to
the recipient. The Company does not expect to repurchase shares to satisfy stock option exercises. 

The Company uses the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to determine the fair value of all its option grants. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant was based upon
the yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities with a term similar to the expected life of the related option. The Company s
expected stock price volatility assumption is based upon the Company s own implied volatility. As the Company has limited stock
option exercise information, the expected life assumption used for option grants is based upon the simplified method provided for under
the FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation . The dividend yield assumption is based upon
the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and presently has no intention of paying cash dividends. 

The Company did not grant
any stock options during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Overview 

Phio is a clinical stage biotechnology
company whose proprietary INTASYL small interfering RNA gene silencing technology is designed to make immune cells more effective
in killing tumor cells. We are developing therapeutics that are designed to leverage INTASYL to precisely target specific proteins that
reduce the body s ability to fight cancer, without the need for specialized formulations or drug delivery systems. 

Cost
Rationalization 

In
2023, we implemented a cost rationalization program driven by our transition from a research company to a product development company.
This transition resulted in a decision not to renew the lease for our corporate headquarters and primary research facility in Marlborough,
Massachusetts, which expired on March 31, 2024. As of April 1, 2024, we have continued operations primarily as a remote business with
a laboratory facility in Worcester, Massachusetts. Additionally, we rationalized research personnel and reduced our headcount by approximately
36 . These expense reductions have been redirected to funding the Phase 1b clinical trial with PH-762 directed toward skin cancer. 

17 

PH-762 

PH-762 is an INTASYL compound
designed to reduce the expression of cell death protein 1 PD-1 ). PD-1 is a protein that inhibits T cells 
ability to kill cancer cells and is a clinically validated target in immunotherapy. Decreasing the expression of PD-1 can thereby increase
the capacity of T cells, which protect the body from cancer cells and infections, to kill cancer cells. 

Our preclinical studies have
demonstrated that direct-to-tumor application of PH-762 resulted in potent anti-tumoral effects and have shown that direct-to-tumor treatment
with PH-762 inhibits tumor growth in a dose dependent fashion in PD-1 responsive and refractory models. Importantly, direct-to-tumor administration
of PH-762 resulted in activity against distant untreated tumors, indicative of a systemic anti-tumor response. We believe these data further
support the potential for PH-762 to provide a strong local immune response without the dose immune-related adverse effects seen with systemic
antibody therapy. 

PH-762 is currently being
evaluated in a U.S. multi-center Phase 1b dose-escalating clinical trial through the intratumoral injection of PH-762 for the treatment
of patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety and
tolerability of neoadjuvant use of intratumorally injected PH-762, assess the tumor response, and determine the dose or dose range for
continued study of PH-762 and is expected to enroll up to 30 patients. In November 2023, we announced the dosing of the first patient
under a previously cleared Investigational New Drug IND application by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In
May 2024, a safety monitoring committee reviewed data from the first dose cohort treated and recommended the escalation to the next dose
concentration. Five (5) patients with cutaneous carcinomas have enrolled in Cohorts 1 and 2. Intratumoral injection of PH-762 has been
well tolerated in all patients enrolled in the trial to date. There were no related adverse events, no serious adverse events, and no
dose limiting toxicities or dose adjustments. The trial is open for the continued enrollment of patients and expects to complete enrollment
of patients in the third quarter of 2025. 

AgonOx Collaboration 

Due to INTASYL s ease
of administration, we have shown that our compounds can easily be incorporated into current adoptive cell therapy ACT manufacturing processes. In ACT, T cells are usually taken from a patient's own blood or tumor tissue, grown in large numbers in a laboratory,
and then given back to the patient to help the immune system fight cancer. By treating T cells with our INTASYL compounds while they are
being grown in the laboratory, we believe our INTASYL compounds can improve these immune cells to make them more effective in killing
cancer. Preclinical data generated in collaboration with AgonOx, Inc. AgonOx ), a private company developing a pipeline
of novel immunotherapy drugs targeting key regulators of the immune response to cancer, demonstrated that treating AgonOx s double
positive tumor infiltrating lymphocytes DP TIL with PH-762 increased their tumor killing activity by two-fold. 

In February 2021, we
entered into a clinical co-development collaboration agreement (the Clinical Co-Development Agreement with AgonOx
to develop a T cell-based therapy using PH-762 and AgonOx s DP TIL. Under the Clinical Co-Development Agreement, we and AgonOx were
working to develop a T cell-based therapy using the our lead product candidate, PH-762, and AgonOx s DP TIL technology. We had agreed
to reimburse AgonOx up to 4 million in expenses incurred to conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial of PH-762 treated DP TIL in patients with
advanced melanoma and other advanced solid tumors. We were also eligible to receive certain future development milestones and low single-digit
sales-based royalty payments from AgonOx s licensing of its DP TIL technology. 

In May 2024, we terminated
the Clinical Co-Development Agreement with AgonOx, which such termination was effective immediately. Effective as of the date of termination,
the Clinical Co-Development Agreement and our continuing obligations and those of AgonOx thereunder were terminated in their entirety.
We are no longer required to provide financial support for the development of costs incurred under the Clinical Co-Development Agreement,
and we are no longer entitled to future development milestones or royalty payments from AgonOx s licensing of its DP TIL technology.
We will pay to AgonOx all payment obligations that accrued prior to the termination of the Clinical Co-Development Agreement. Remaining
payments to be made to AgonOx as of September 30, 2024 total 35,000, which primarily relate to accrued obligations for patient fees and
other miscellaneous costs as of the date of termination. Pursuant to the terms of the Clinical Co-Development Agreement, we and AgonOx
are coordinating the orderly wind-down of the Phase 1 clinical trial. Each of us and AgonOx shall be responsible for its own costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the wind-down of the Phase 1 clinical trial. 

18 

Prior to the termination
of the Clinical Co-Development Agreement with AgonOx, PH-762 treated DP TIL were being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in the United
States with up to 18 patients with advanced melanoma and other advanced solid tumors by AgonOx. The primary trial objectives were to
evaluate the safety and to study the potential for enhanced therapeutic benefit from the administration of PH-762 treated DP TIL. AgonOx
had enrolled three patients. The first two patients were treated with DP TIL only and the third patient was treated with a combination
of DP TIL and PH-762. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and base our estimates on
historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could have a material impact on our reported results. 

There have been no material
changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expenses
relate to compensation and benefits for research and development personnel, facility-related expenses, supplies, external services, costs
to acquire technology licenses, research activities under our research collaboration agreement, expenses associated with preclinical and
clinical development activities and other operating costs. Our research and development programs are focused on the development of immuno-oncology
therapeutics based on our INTASYL therapeutic platform. Since we commenced operations, research and development expenses have been a significant
portion of our total operating expenses and are expected to constitute the majority of our spending for the foreseeable future. 

Research and development expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 64 as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in
research and development expenses was primarily driven by our cost rationalization measures in transitioning from a research company to
a product development company resulting in a decrease of 286,000 in salary-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense,
and 85,000 due to the wind-down of preclinical studies, and 835,000 primarily related to our former Clinical Co-Development Agreement
from the prior year period. 

Research and development expenses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 50 as compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in
research and development expenses was primarily driven by our cost rationalization measures in transitioning from a research company to
a product development company resulting in a decrease of 880,000 of expense due to the wind-down of preclinical studies, 1,108,000 in
salary-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and 204,000 in lab supplies associated with the reduction in headcount,
in addition to decreases in clinical consulting fees of 350,000 incurred in connection with our IND filing for PH-762 in the prior period,
decreases in clinical trial-related fees for our former PH-762 trials in ACT and European clinical trial, and a decrease of 208,000 in
manufacturing fees for PH-762. 

We anticipate our research
and development expenses will remain relatively consistent for the remainder of 2024. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative
expenses relate to compensation and benefits for general and administrative personnel, facility-related expenses, professional fees for
legal and patent-related activities, audit, tax and consulting services, as well as other general corporate expenses. 

General and administrative
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2 as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in salary-related expenses. 

General and
administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 15 as compared with the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreases in salary-related expenses due to
reductions in headcount of 196,000, in professional fees for a total of 229,000 primarily related to legal and patent expenses,
and in our D O insurance premium of 74,000 as compared to the prior year period. 

We anticipate our general
and administrative expenses will remain relatively consistent for the remainder of 2024. 

20 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Historically, our primary
source of funding has been through the sale of our securities. In the future, we will be dependent on obtaining funding from third parties,
such as proceeds from the issuance of debt, sale of equity or strategic opportunities, in order to maintain our operations. We have reported
recurring losses from operations since inception and expect that we will continue to have negative cash flows from our operations for
the foreseeable future. At September 30, 2024, we had cash of 5,390,000 as compared with 8,490,000 at December 31, 2023. 

On May 16, 2024, we entered
into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement with Triton Funds LP Triton ), pursuant to
which we agreed to sell, and Triton agreed to purchase, upon our request in one or more transactions, up to 95,833 shares of our common
stock at a purchase of 6.48 per share (the Purchase Price ), for aggregate gross proceeds of up to 621,000. On July
3, 2024, we terminated the Purchase Agreement with Triton effective immediately. No shares of common stock were sold by us pursuant to
the Purchase Agreement prior to termination. 

In July 2024, we entered into
inducement letter agreements (the July 2024 Inducement Letter Agreements with certain holders of certain of our
existing warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 545,286 shares of the Company s common stock. The existing warrants were originally
issued in February 2020 through December 2023, having exercise prices between 324.00 and 9.72 per share. Pursuant to the July 2024 Inducement
Letter Agreements, these warrants were exercised for cash at a reduced exercise of 5.45 per share in consideration of our agreement to
issue new unregistered five and one-half year term Series C warrants to purchase up to 583,098 shares of common stock at an exercise price
of 5.45 and new unregistered eighteen month term Series D warrants to purchase up to 507,474 shares of common stock at an exercise price
of 5.45, both issued and sold at a price of 0.125 per warrant share (the July 2024 Financing ). The net proceeds
to us from the July 2024 Financing were approximately 2,646,000, after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. 

We have limited cash resources,
have reported recurring losses from operations since inception, have negative operating cash flows and have not yet received product revenues.
These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern, and our current cash resources may not provide
sufficient capital to fund operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of the release of the condensed consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Our continuation as a going concern depends upon our ability to raise additional
capital through equity offerings, debt offerings and/or strategic opportunities to fund our operations. There can be no assurance that
we will be successful in accomplishing any of these plans in order to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

our cash flows for the periods indicated, in thousands:

Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating
activities was 5,741,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 8,379,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net loss of 3,407,000, a decrease in non-cash related items of 298,000 primarily
related to reduced stock-based compensation expense, and a decrease in the changes in operating assets and liabilities of 472,000 primarily
as a result of liabilities owed for the completion of preclinical studies in the prior year period. 

Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities 

There
were no investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 5,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to laboratory and computer equipment purchases for our
facility during the prior year period . 

Net Cash Flow from Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing
activities was 2,641,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 5,010,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the net proceeds from the completion of our financing activities during the prior year period
as compared with the current year period. 

Contractual Obligations 

Details of our obligations
under the Clinical Co-Development Agreement with our former collaboration partner AgonOx can be found in Note 2 of the condensed consolidated
financial statements. Outside of the above, there have been no material changes to the contractual obligations as disclosed in our 2023
Form 10-K. 

Future
Funding Requirements 

At
September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 5,390,000 and received estimated net proceeds of 2,646,000 from our July
2024 Financing . We expect that our cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our current
operating plan into Q2 2025. Due to the difficulty and uncertainty associated with the design and implementation of preclinical studies
and clinical trials, we will continue to assess our cash and cash equivalents and future funding requirements. However, there is no assurance
that additional funding will be achieved and that we will succeed in our future operations. We expect to continue to incur substantial
additional operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue to develop our product candidates and seek marketing approval
and, subject to obtaining such approval, the eventual commercialization of our product candidates. If we obtain marketing approval for
any of our product candidates, we will incur significant sales, marketing and manufacturing expenses. We also expect to continue to incur
significant costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls and similar requirements associated with operating as a public
reporting company. 

Actual
cash requirements could differ from management s projections due to many factors including additional investments in research and
development programs, clinical trial expenses for PH-762 , competing technological and market
developments, general and administrative expenses, and the costs of any strategic acquisitions and/or development of complementary business
opportunities. 

We
expect to seek additional funding to sustain our future operations and while we have successfully raised capital in the past, the ability
to raise capital in future periods is not assured. We do not know if additional capital will be available when needed or on terms favorable
to us or our stockholders. Collaboration, licensing or other agreements may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we seek
to sell our equity securities, we do not know whether and to what extent we will be able to do so, or on what terms. If available, additional
equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, debt financing may involve restrictive covenants or other unfavorable terms and dilute
our existing stockholders equity, and funding through collaboration, licensing or other commercial agreements may be on unfavorable
terms, including requiring us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products. If adequate financing is not available
if and when needed, we may delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate research or development programs, if any, postpone or cancel the pursuit
of product candidates, or otherwise significantly curtail our operations to reduce our cash requirements and extend our capital.

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a smaller reporting company,
we are not required to provide this information. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation
of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ))
as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information that we are required to disclose in reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 

Our disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. We believe that a control system, no matter how
well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Based
on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, management, with the participation
of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ending September 30, 2024 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

23 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may
become a party to various legal proceedings and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to
any actual or threatened material legal proceedings of which we are aware. 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

Other than set forth below,
there have been no material changes in our risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K.
The risk factor set forth below and risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in
these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including these risks. Additional risks not currently known or currently
material to us may also harm our business. 

We may not be able to maintain compliance
with the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market. 

Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1)
requires companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain stockholders equity of at least 2.5 million for continued listing.
As of September 30, 2024, our stockholders equity was 4.9 million and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain
or increase our stockholders equity in the future. If our stockholders equity falls below 2.5 million, as a result of operating
losses or for other reasons, or if we are unable to demonstrate to Nasdaq s satisfaction that we subsequently regained compliance
with this requirement, Nasdaq will notify us of such non-compliance. If we receive such notice from Nasdaq, in accordance with the Nasdaq
Listing Rules, we will have 45 calendar days from the date of the notification to submit a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(b)(1). If our compliance plan is accepted, we may be granted up to 180 calendar days from the date of the initial notification
to evidence compliance. If our compliance plan is not accepted or we are otherwise unable to evidence compliance within Nasdaq s
allotted timeframe, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. 

Such a delisting would have
an adverse effect on the market liquidity of our securities, decrease the market price of our securities, result in the potential loss
of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities, and adversely affect our
ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations. We are actively monitoring our stockholders equity and will
consider any and all options available to us to maintain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1).
