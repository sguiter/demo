Total Net Revenues 

The revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 includes of prior period sales tax refunds. The Company s service specific revenue recognition policies are as follows: Pharmacy The Company s revenue is derived primarily from providing pharmacy goods and services to patients and is recognized on the date goods and services are provided at amounts billable to individual patients, adjusted for estimates for variable consideration. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the Company, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under customer arrangements. Significant portions of the revenue from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products are reimbursed by the federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. The Company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as other third-party insurance payors, and reduces revenue at the revenue recognition date, to properly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the total net revenues and receivables reported in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors. Receivables and Provision for Credit Losses The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 326, Financial Statements Credit Losses Topic 326 with an adoption date of July 1, 2023. This standard requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial assets. The Company evaluates the valuation of accounts receivable concessions allowances based upon its historical collection trends, as well as its understanding of the nature and collectability of accounts based on their age and other factors. The model is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset based on the Company s expectations as of the balance sheet date through analyzing historical customer data as well as taking into consideration current and estimated future economic trends. The Company adopted Topic 326 and determined it did not have a material financial impact.

 which resulted in a pre-tax gain on the sale of for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. On September 6, 2024, the Company sold 24.7 acres of undeveloped land in Ellijay, GA, for cash of which resulted in a pre-tax gain on the sale of for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

income tax expense was recorded for continuing operations for the three months ended September 30 2024. Income tax expense of (all state income taxes) was recorded for continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ASC 740, we evaluate our deferred taxes quarterly to determine if adjustments to our valuation allowance are required based on the consideration of available positive and negative evidence using a more likely than not standard with respect to whether deferred tax assets will be realized. Our evaluation considers, among other factors, our historical operating results, our expectation of future results of operations, the duration of applicable statuary carryforward periods and conditions of the healthcare industry. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which the related temporary differences in the financial basis and the tax basis of the assets become deductible. The value of our deferred tax assets will depend on applicable income tax rates. At September 30, 2024, consistent with the above process, we evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and determined that it was more likely than not that none of our deferred tax assets would be realized. As a result, in accordance with ASC 740, we recognized a valuation allowance of against the deferred tax asset so that there is net long-term deferred income tax asset at September 30, 2024. We conducted our evaluation by considering available positive and negative evidence to determine our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. In our evaluation, we gave more significant weight to evidence that was objective in nature as compared to subjective evidence. A long-term deferred tax liability of is recorded within other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of September 30, 2024 to reflect the deferred tax liability for the non-amortizing trade name intangible asset.

For federal income tax purposes, at September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 26,502 of estimated net operating loss carry-forwards available for use in future years subject to the possible limitations of the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 382. These net operating loss carryforwards expire primarily in fiscal year ; however, with the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017, federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 now have no expiration date.

Net operating loss carry-forwards generated in tax years prior to June 30, 2020 are still subject to redetermination in potential federal income tax examination.

negative consequences of Federal and state insurance exchanges and their rules relating to reimbursement terms; 

the regulatory environment for our businesses, including pharmacy licensing laws and regulations and rules and judicial cases relating thereto; 

the failure of government and private reimbursement to cover our increasing costs; 

15 

changes in or failure to comply with Federal, state and local laws and regulations and enforcement interpretations of such laws and regulations affecting our pharmacy business; and 

the possible enactment of additional Federal healthcare reform laws or reform laws or regulations in states where our subsidiaries operate pharmacy facilities or additional healthcare facilities (including Medicaid waivers, bundled payments, managed care programs, accountable care and similar organizations, competitive bidding and other reforms).

 Business Strategy: Operations, Dispositions and Acquisitions 
 The Board of Directors of SunLink (the "Board of Directors" or the "Board") believes management of the Company should, among other things, actively pursue one or more extraordinary corporate transactions, any of which transactions may involve merger or consolidation with a third party, as a result of which the Company's shareholders may not hold a majority of the equity in, or otherwise control the resulting entity. The Company is seeking to achieve a merger or other transaction which, among other things, provides the potential for growth in shareholder value on what it believes is a reasonable risk/reward basis.

 The Company expects to use existing cash primarily to sustain its operations and to fund activities related to such extraordinary transactions when available and appropriate, and for other general corporate purposes. The Company believes certain portions of its businesses continue to under-perform and the Company periodically entertains overtures for the sale of one or more of its businesses when deemed appropriate, including to better position the company for an extraordinary corporate business transaction such as a merger or consolidation. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been made could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 
 Our critical accounting estimates are more fully described in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and continue to include the following areas: receivables net and provision for doubtful accounts; revenue recognition and net patient service revenues; goodwill, intangible assets and accounting for business combinations; professional and general liability claims; and accounting for income taxes. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates for the periods presented other than amounts readily computable from the financial statements included in this form 10-Q. 
 
 Financial Summary 
 Results of Operations 
 The Company s operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 continued to be negatively impacted by the effects of the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, although mitigated somewhat from prior quarters, including among other factors, difficulty hiring qualified employees, rising labor and supply costs and supply chain challenges resulting in inability to obtain pharmacy and DME products on a timely, cost effective basis.

Pharmacy net revenues for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased 632 or 7 from the three month period ended September 30, 2023. The revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 include 321 of prior period sales tax refunds. The decrease in pharmacy net revenues for the three months period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period last fiscal year resulted from lower retail pharmacy scripts filled and lower durable medical equipment ("DME") orders shipped. Institutional pharmacy scripts filled increased 10 in the three months ended September 30, 204 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Costs and expenses, including depreciation and amortization, were 9,117 and 9,005 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Almost all categories of costs and expenses increased as a percent of net revenues in the three ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year due to the decreased net revenues this year. Cost of goods sold decreased 6 in total due to the reduced volume. Salaries, wages and benefits ("SWB") increased in total for the three ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period last year due to higher salaries and wages required in connection with current labor markets and operating challenges of labor allocation relating to the pandemic aftereffects, including the use of contract labor and higher employee benefit costs. Depreciation expense also increased this year due to the 1,467 of capital expenditures last fiscal year. 
 Operating Profit (Loss) 
 
 The Company reported an operating loss of 1,194 for the three months period ended September 30, 2024 compared to an operating loss of 450 for the three months period ended September 30, 2023. The increased operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months period ended September 30, 2023 resulted from the 7 decrease in net revenues this quarter and increased costs as a percentage of net revenues. 
 Gain on Sale of Assets 
 On August 2, 2024, the Company sold its all its minority equity ownership investment in a subsidiary to the majority owner for cash of 1,064 which resulted in a pre-tax gain on the sale of 665 for the quarter ended 
 18 

September 30, 2024. On September 6, 2024, the Company sold 24.7 acres of undeveloped land for cash of 401 which resulted in a pre-tax gain on the sale of 29 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 	No income tax expense was recorded for continuing operations for the three months ended September 30 2024. Income tax expense of 2 (all state income taxes) was recorded for continuing operations for the three months ended September 30 2023. 
 In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ASC 740, we evaluate our deferred taxes quarterly to determine if adjustments to our valuation allowance are required based on the consideration of available positive and negative evidence using a more likely than not standard with respect to whether deferred tax assets will be realized. Our evaluation considers, among other factors, our historical operating results, our expectation of future results of operations, the duration of applicable statuary carryforward periods and conditions of the healthcare industry. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which the related temporary differences in the financial basis and the tax basis of the assets become deductible. The value of our deferred tax assets will depend on applicable income tax rates. 
 At September 30, 2024, consistent with the above process, we evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and determined that it was more likely than not that none of our deferred tax assets would be realized. As a result, in accordance with ASC 740, we recognized a valuation allowance of 8,183 against the deferred tax asset so that there is no net long-term deferred income tax asset at September 30, 2024. We conducted our evaluation by considering available positive and negative evidence to determine our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. In our evaluation, we gave more significant weight to evidence that was objective in nature as compared to subjective evidence. A long-term deferred tax liability of 69 is recorded within other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of September 30, 2024 to reflect the deferred tax liability for the non-amortizing trade name intangible asset. 
 The principal negative evidence that led us to determine at September 30, 2024 that all the deferred tax assets should have full valuation allowances was historical tax losses and the projected current fiscal year tax loss. For purposes of evaluating our valuations allowances, the Company s history of losses represent significant historical negative evidence and we have recognized none of our federal income tax net operating loss carry-forward of approximately 26,502. 
 For federal income tax purposes, at September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 26,502 of estimated net operating loss carry-forwards available for use in future years subject to the possible limitations of the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 382. These net operating loss carryforwards expire primarily in fiscal year 2025 through fiscal year 2038; however, with the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017, federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 now have no expiration date. The Company s returns for the periods prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 are no longer subject to potential federal and state income tax examination. Net operating loss carry-forwards generated in tax years prior to June 30, 2020 are still subject to redetermination in potential federal income tax examination. 
 
 Loss from Continuing Operations after Income Taxes 
 The loss from continuing operations after income taxes was 442 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss from continuing operations after income taxes of 428 for the three month period ended September 30,2023. The decreased loss in the current quarter resulted from the 694 of gains on asset sales. 
 Loss from Discontinued Operations after Income Taxes 
 The loss from discontinued operations after income taxes was 107 for the quarter September 30, 2024 compared to a loss from discontinued operations after income taxes of 916 for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. The loss this year results from transaction costs for the sale of the Trace Real Estate which was closed on October 9, 2024 and additional reserves for uncollectible receivables retained on the sale of the nursing home last fiscal year. The 
 19 

loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 results from primarily from the loss incurred by the operations of the Trace hospital and nursing home. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 
 All of the businesses discussed below are reported as discontinued operations and the condensed consolidated financial statements for all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. 
 
 Sale of Trace Regional Hospital, medical office building, three patient clinics, and Trace Extended Care operations On January 22, 2024, the Company's indirect subsidiary, Southern Health Corporation of Houston, Inc. Southern ), reached revised agreements (the "Revised Agreements") for the sale of Trace Regional Hospital, a vacant medical office building and three (3) patient clinics in Chickasaw County, MS, (collectively Trace to Progressive Health of Houston, LLC Progressive pursuant to which (i) Southern sold certain personal and intangible property to Progressive for 500 under to an asset purchase agreement ('Trace Hospital Assets Sale"), (ii) entered into a six-month net lease of the real property of the hospital, medical office building and the clinics real property (the "Trace Real Estate") for 20 per month, (iii) entered into a contract to sell the Trace Real Estate to Progressive (the "Trace Real Estate Sale") for 2,000 and (iv) engaged Progressive under a management agreement to manage the operations of Trace pending receipt of certain regulatory approvals, which were received February 29, 2024. The Company recorded a loss of 962 on the Trace Hospital Assets Sale during the year ended June 30, 2024, which included sale expenses of 174. The Trace Real Estate Sale was completed on October 9, 2024. The Company reported an additional asset impairment reserve of 44 in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 for transaction expenses incurred at the sale date. SunLink earlier reported an impairment loss of 1,974 at December 31, 2023 to reduce the net value of the Trace hospital assets to the estimated sale proceeds under the Revised Agreement. An impairment reserve of 1,739 remains at September 30, 2024 for the Trace Real Estate Sale assets. On June 3, 2024, the Company's indirect subsidiary, Southern Health Corporation of Houston, Inc. and an affiliate completed the sale of its Trace Extended Care Rehab senior care facility and related real estate in Houston, Mississippi for approximately 7,100 (the "Trace Extended Care Facility Sale"). The net proceeds of approximately 6,522 have been retained for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company recorded a gain of 5,584 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 on the Trace Extended Care Facility Sale, which included sale expenses of 578. 
 
 Sold Hospitals Subsidiaries of the Company have sold substantially all the assets of five (5) other hospitals Sold Facilities during the period July 2, 2012 to March 17, 2019. The loss before income taxes of the Sold Facilities results primarily from the effects of retained professional liability insurance and claims expenses and settlement of a lawsuit. 
 
 Life Sciences and Engineering Segment SunLink retained a defined benefit retirement plan which covered substantially all the employees of this segment when the segment was sold in fiscal year 1998. Effective February 28, 1997, the plan was amended to freeze participant benefits and close the plan to new participants. Pension expense and related tax benefit or expense is reflected in the results of discontinued operations for this segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net Loss 
 
 Net loss for the three months period ended September 30, 2024 was 549 (or a loss of 0.08 per fully diluted share) as compared to a net loss of 1,344 (or a loss of 0.19 per fully diluted share) for the three months period ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 The Company and its subsidiaries' primary source of liquidity for working capital and operational needs, and for general corporate purposes, is unrestricted cash on hand, which was 7,529 at September 30, 2024, and the proceeds 
 20 

of approximately 1,932 from the sale of the Trace Real Estate on October 9, 2024. From time-to-time, we may, nevertheless, seek to obtain financing for the liquidity needs of the Company or individual subsidiaries 
 Subject to the effects, risks and uncertainties associated with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic , we believe, as discussed further below, that we have adequate liquidity to support our current level of operations through the next twelve months. 
 
 Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies 
 Contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies related to noncancelable operating leases from continuing operations at September 30, 2024 were as follows:

As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding debt. 
 The Company currently expects its pharmacy business to purchase approximately 800 of capitalizable DME by the pharmacy operations (to be rented to customers) during the next twelve months. The timing and actual amount which will be expended is difficult to predict due to various factors including varying demand for such equipment as well as its availability given current supply sourcing challenges. The pharmacy business also has a 50 capital commitment for the upgrade of its drug compounding facility. Other capital expenditures for replacement and upgrade of current facilities and equipment of the pharmacy business may be needed during the next twelve months although there is no estimate of those expenditures other than being expected to be at a lower level than fiscal years 2024 and 2023. The Company anticipates funding such expenditures primarily from cash on hand. Other cash expenditures for the next twelve months currently are expected to be in-line with expenditures for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, subject to further operating and administrative cost increases, and other settlements of cost reports and other liabilities in the ordinary course of business as well as cash receipts and disbursements relating to possible asset sales. Other than reported above, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business relating to our upcoming cash obligations which have occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Other than with respect to scheduled cash expenditures (based on current operating levels) for operating leases, and the specific items previously disclosed here, as well as continued uncertainties relating to the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic and asset sales, the Company is currently unaware of other trends or unusual uncertainties that are likely to cause a material change in its cash expenditures in periods beyond the next twelve months. See Note 9, to our condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company is also unaware of events that are reasonably likely to cause a material change in the relationship between its costs and revenues (such as known or reasonably likely future increases in costs of labor or materials, price increases or inventory adjustments, beyond those discussed herein); however, we are unable to predict 
 21 

with any degree of accuracy when, or the extent to which, recent inflationary price trends, labor disruptions and supply chain challenges experienced in 2023 and 2024 to date will mitigate or accelerate. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 A former director of the Company, who resigned in July 2024, is senior counsel in a law firm which provides services to SunLink. The Company expensed an aggregate of 161 and 187 for legal services to this law firm in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Included in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 is outstanding legal expenses to this firm 173 and 156, respectively. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We have not entered into any transactions using derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and believe that our exposure to market risk associated with other financial instruments (such as investments and borrowings) and interest rate risk is not material. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and the changes in our disclosure controls and procedures during the quarter. Under the direction of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 
 Disclosure controls and procedures and other procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms.

 Based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures performed in connection with the preparation of this Form 10-Q, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.

 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 	 
 	The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various claims and litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including, among other things, tax, contract, workers compensation and medical malpractice claims and other claims and litigation. Medical malpractice and certain other claims are generally covered by malpractice, general liability or other insurance but are subject to provisions under which the Company retains a portion of the risk, which retention, particularly in the case of claims of medical malpractice, can be material. Based on current knowledge, the Company s management does not believe that any current pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or its liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved and indeterminate damages sought in some such legal proceedings, an adverse outcome could be material to our results of operations or cash flows in any reporting period.
