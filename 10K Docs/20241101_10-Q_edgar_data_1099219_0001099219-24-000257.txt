 (1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net effect of changes in cash flow assumptions was partially offset by the corresponding impact in DPL associated with the RIS segment s annuity products of million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net effect of changes in cash flow assumptions was largely offset by the corresponding impact in DPL associated with the RIS segment s annuity products of million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net effect of changes in cash flow assumptions was primarily driven by updates in assumptions related to mortality.

 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net effect of actual variances from expected experience was largely offset by the corresponding impact in DPL associated with the RIS segment s annuity products of million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net effect of actual variances from expected experience was primarily driven by favorable mortality. 
 Significant Methodologies and Assumptions 
 The principal inputs used in the establishment of the FPB for the RIS segment s annuity products include actual premiums, actual benefits, in-force data, locked-in claim-related expense, the locked-in interest accretion rate, the current upper-medium grade discount rate at the balance sheet date and best estimate mortality assumptions. 
 When single premium annuity contracts are issued, the FPB reserve is required to be measured at an upper-medium grade discount rate. Due to differences between the upper-medium grade discount rate and pricing assumptions used to determine the contractual premium, the initial FPB reserve at issue for a particular cohort may be greater than the contractual premium received, and the difference must be recognized as an immediate loss at issue. On these cohorts, future experience that differs from expected experience and changes in cash flow assumptions result in the recognition of remeasurement gains and losses with net remeasurement gains limited to the amount of the original loss at issue, after which any favorable experience is deferred and recorded within the DPL. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a loss at issue of million. Substantially all the loss at issue was offset by a deferred gain on ceded reinsurance, which will be amortized over the life of the reinsurance agreement. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a net remeasurement gain related to the net effect of changes in cash flow assumptions.

 Significant Methodologies and Assumptions 
 The Company issues certain retirement assurance products with guarantees that meet the definition of MRBs, which are measured, in aggregate, as one compound MRB, at estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net income, except for changes in nonperformance risk of the Company which are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) OCI ). 
 The Company calculates the fair value of these MRBs, which is estimated as the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected attributed fees, using actuarial and capital market assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. The calculation is based on in-force business, projecting future cash flows from the MRB over multiple risk neutral stochastic scenarios using observable risk-free rates. 
 Capital market assumptions, such as risk-free rates and implied volatilities, are based on market prices for publicly traded instruments to the extent that prices for such instruments are observable. Implied volatilities beyond the observable period are extrapolated based on observable implied volatilities and historical volatilities. Actuarial assumptions, including mortality, lapse, withdrawal and utilization, are unobservable and are reviewed at least annually based on actuarial studies of historical experience. See Note 12 for additional information on significant unobservable inputs. 
 The valuation of these MRBs includes a nonperformance risk adjustment and adjustments for a risk margin related to non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance adjustment is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc. s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries as compared to MetLife, Inc. 
 Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions at annuitization, premium persistency, partial withdrawal and surrenders.

 6. Market Risk Benefits (continued) 

 Significant Methodologies and Assumptions 
 The Company issues GMDBs, GMWBs, guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits GMABs and GMIBs that typically meet the definition of MRBs, which are measured, in aggregate, as one compound MRB, at estimated fair value separately from the variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net income, except for changes in nonperformance risk of the Company which are recorded in OCI. 
 The Company calculates the fair value of these MRBs, which is estimated as the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected attributed fees, using actuarial and capital market assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. The calculation is based on in-force business, projecting future cash flows from the MRB over multiple risk neutral stochastic scenarios using observable risk-free rates. 
 Capital market assumptions, such as risk-free rates and implied volatilities, are based on market prices for publicly traded instruments to the extent that prices for such instruments are observable. Implied volatilities beyond the observable period are extrapolated based on observable implied volatilities and historical volatilities. Actuarial assumptions, including mortality, lapse, withdrawal and utilization, are unobservable and are reviewed at least annually based on actuarial studies of historical experience. See Note 12 for additional information on significant unobservable inputs. 
 The valuation of these MRBs includes a nonperformance risk adjustment and adjustments for a risk margin related to non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance adjustment is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc. s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries as compared to MetLife, Inc. 
 Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions at annuitization, premium persistency, partial withdrawal and surrenders. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees. 
 These guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions, including changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; and variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, impact the estimated fair value of the guarantees and affect net income, and changes in nonperformance risk of the Company affect OCI.

 Evaluation of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS in an Unrealized Loss Position 
 Gross unrealized losses on securities without an ACL decreased billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to billion primarily due to a decrease in interest rates. 
 As shown in the table above, most of the gross unrealized losses on securities without an ACL that have been in a continuous gross unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater at September 30, 2024, relate to investment grade securities. These unrealized losses are principally due to widening credit spreads since purchase and, with respect to fixed-rate securities, rising interest rates since purchase. 
 As of September 30, 2024, million of gross unrealized losses on securities without an ACL that have been in a continuous gross unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater on below investment grade securities were concentrated in the utility, consumer, and communications sectors within corporate securities and in foreign government securities. These unrealized losses are the result of significantly wider credit spreads resulting from higher risk premiums since purchase, largely due to economic and market uncertainty and, with respect to fixed-rate securities, rising interest rates since purchase.

 The change in estimated fair values and earned income of derivatives hedging variable annuity guarantees, recorded in net derivative gains (losses), were million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Based on gross notional amounts, a substantial portion of the Company s derivatives was not designated or did not qualify as part of a hedging relationship a t both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company s use of derivatives includes (i) derivatives that serve as macro hedges of the Company s exposure to various risks and that generally do not qualify for hedge accounting due to the criteria required under the portfolio hedging rules, (ii) derivatives that economically hedge insurance liabilities that contain mortality or morbidity risk and that generally do not qualify for hedge accounting because the lack of these risks in the derivatives cannot support an expectation of a highly effective hedging relationship, (iii) derivatives that economically hedge MRBs that do not qualify for hedge accounting because the changes in estimated fair value of the MRBs are already recorded in net income, and (iv) written credit default swaps and interest rate swaps that are used to synthetically create investments and that do not qualify for hedge accounting because they do not involve a hedging relationship. For these nonqualified derivatives, changes in market factors can lead to the recognition of fair value changes on the statement of operations without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged.

 For the Company s foreign currency forwards, the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative related to the changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward price is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The Company has elected to record changes in estimated fair value of excluded components in earnings. For all other derivatives, all components of each derivative s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
 
 In certain instances, the Company discontinued cash flow hedge accounting because the forecasted transactions were no longer probable of occurring. Because certain of the forecasted transactions also were not probable of occurring within two months of the anticipated date, the Company reclassified amounts from AOCI into income. These amounts were million and million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 A t both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company was hedging its exposure to variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions did not exceed . 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance in AOCI associated with cash flow hedges was million and million, respectively. 
 All components of each derivative s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company expected to reclassify million of deferred net gains (losses) on derivatives in AOCI to earnings within the next 12 months.

 (2) Estimated fair value of derivatives is limited to the amount that is subject to set-off and includes income or expense accruals. 
 (3) Cash collateral received by the Company for OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives, where the central clearinghouse treats variation margin as collateral, is included in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments or in fixed maturity securities AFS, and the obligation to return it is included in payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions on the balance sheet. For certain collateral agreements, cash collateral is pledged to the Company as initial margin on its OTC-bilateral derivatives. 
 (4) The receivable for the return of cash collateral provided by the Company is inclusive of initial margin on exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives and is included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the balance sheet. The amount of cash collateral offset in the table above is limited to the net estimated fair value of derivatives after application of netting agreements. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, th e Company received excess cash collateral of million and million, respectively, and provided excess cash collateral of million and million, respectively, which is not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation.

 of the c ollateral had been sold or re-pledged. Securities collateral pledged by the Company is reported in fixed maturity securities AFS on the balance sheet. Subject to certain constraints, the counterparties are permitted by contract to sell or re-pledge this collateral. The amount of securities collateral offset in the table above is limited to the net estimated fair value of derivatives after application of netting agreements and cash collateral. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company received excess securities collateral with an estimated fair value of million and million, respectively, for its OTC-bilateral derivatives, which are not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company provided excess securities collateral with an estimated fair value of billion, at both periods, for its OTC-bilateral derivatives, million and million, respectively, for its OTC-cleared derivatives, and million and million, respectively, for its exchange-traded derivatives, which are not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation. 
 The Company s collateral arrangements for its OTC-bilateral derivatives generally require the counterparty in a net liability position, after considering the effect of netting agreements, to pledge collateral when the collateral amount owed by that counterparty reaches a minimum transfer amount. Substantially all of the Company s netting agreements for derivatives contain provisions that require both the Company and the counterparty to maintain a specific investment grade credit rating from each of Moody s and S P. If a party s credit or financial strength rating, as applicable, were to fall below that specific investment grade credit rating, that party would be in violation of these provisions, and the other party to the derivatives could terminate the transactions and demand immediate settlement payment based on such party s reasonable valuation of the derivatives. A small number of these arrangements also include credit-contingent provisions that include a threshold above which collateral must be posted. Such agreements provide for a reduction of these thresholds (on a sliding scale that converges toward zero) in the event of downgrades in the credit ratings of MetLife, Inc. and/or the counterparty. At September 30, 2024, the amount of collateral not provided by the Company due to the existence of these thresholds was million.

 (1) The weighted average for fixed maturity securities AFS and derivatives is determined based on the estimated fair value of the securities and derivatives. The weighted average for MRBs is determined based on a combination of account values and experience data. 
 (2) The impact of a decrease in input would have resulted in the opposite impact on estimated fair value. For MRBs, changes to direct and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits are based on liability positions; changes to ceded guaranteed minimum benefits are based on asset positions. 
 (3) Significant increases (decreases) in expected default rates in isolation would have resulted in substantially lower (higher) valuations. 
 (4) Range and weighted average are presented in accordance with the market convention for fixed maturity securities AFS of dollars per hundred dollars of par. 
 (5) Changes in the assumptions used for the probability of default would have been accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for the loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumptions used for prepayment rates. 
 (6) Ranges represent the rates across different yield curves and are presented in basis points. The swap yield curves are utilized among different types of derivatives to project cash flows, as well as to discount future cash flows to present value. Since this valuation methodology uses a range of inputs across a yield curve to value the derivative, presenting a range is more representative of the unobservable input used in the valuation.

 All other classes of securities classified within Level 3, including those within Unit-linked and FVO securities, Other investments, Separate account assets, and Embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance, use the same valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs as previously described for Level 3 securities. Generally, all other classes of assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 that are not included above use the same valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs as previously described for Level 3. The sensitivity of the estimated fair value to changes in the significant unobservable inputs for these other assets and liabilities is similar in nature to that described in the preceding table. The valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement for the more significant assets measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis and determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are summarized in Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.

 Matters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made 
 For other matters, the Company is not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The Company is often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings by the court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts, and the progress of settlement negotiations. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to litigation contingencies and updates its accruals, disclosures and estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews. 
 Asbestos-Related Claims 
 MLIC is and has been a defendant in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and seek both actual and punitive damages. MLIC has never engaged in the business of manufacturing or selling asbestos-containing products, nor has MLIC issued liability or workers compensation insurance to companies in the business of manufacturing or selling asbestos-containing products. The lawsuits principally have focused on allegations with respect to certain research, publication and other activities of one or more of MLIC s employees during the period from the 1920s through approximately the 1950s and allege that MLIC learned or should have learned of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among other things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health risks. MLIC believes that it should not have legal liability in these cases. The outcome of most asbestos litigation matters, however, is uncertain and can be impacted by numerous variables, including differences in legal rulings in various jurisdictions, the nature of the alleged injury and factors unrelated to the ultimate legal merit of the claims asserted against MLIC. 
 MLIC s defenses include that: (i) MLIC owed no duty to the plaintiffs; (ii) plaintiffs did not rely on any actions of MLIC; (iii) MLIC s conduct was not the cause of the plaintiffs injuries; and (iv) plaintiffs exposure occurred after the dangers of asbestos were known. During the course of the litigation, certain trial courts have granted motions dismissing claims against MLIC, while other trial courts have denied MLIC s motions. There can be no assurance that MLIC will receive favorable decisions on motions in the future. While most cases brought to date have settled, MLIC intends to continue to defend aggressively against claims based on asbestos exposure, including defending claims at trials. 
 As reported in the 2023 Annual Report, MLIC received approximately asbestos-related claims in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MLIC received approximately and new asbestos-related claims, respectively. See Note 24 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 Annual Report for historical information concerning asbestos claims and MLIC s update in its recorded liability at December 31, 2023. The number of asbestos cases that may be brought, the aggregate amount of any liability that MLIC

 million to million, with a cumulative maximum of million, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future. Management believes that it is unlikely the Company will have to make any material payments under these indemnities or guarantees. 
 In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of their representation of the Company s interests. Since these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these indemnities in the future. 
 The Company also has minimum fund yield requirements on certain pension funds. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future. 
 The Company s recorded liabilities were million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, for indemnities and guarantees.

 Industry Trends 
 We continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment that has been affecting the industry. 
 
 Financial and Economic Environment 
 Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally due to our market presence in numerous countries, our large investment portfolio and the sensitivity of our insurance liabilities and derivatives to changing market factors. 
 We are closely monitoring political and economic conditions that might contribute to global market volatility and impact our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives, such as global inflation, supply chain disruptions, acts of war, and banking sector volatility. We are also monitoring the imposition of tariffs, sanctions or other barriers to international trade, changes to international trade agreements, and their potential impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Investments Current Environment, as well as Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Industry Trends Impact of Market Interest Rates Effects of Inflation in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 Governments and central banks around the world use fiscal and monetary policies to address uncertain economic conditions. In the United States U.S. ), the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC took various actions in 2023 to promote economic stability and combat inflation, including raising interest rates. Rates remained steady through most of 2024. However, in September 2024, the FOMC lowered interest rates, and market forecasts suggest it will continue to reduce interest rates through the remainder of 2024 and 2025 reflecting expectations for continued lower inflation. Similarly, the European Central Bank and Bank of England have recently lowered interest rates, and market forecasts suggest the banks will continue reductions through the remainder of 2024 and 2025. The Bank of Japan raised interest rates in July 2024, but has since then mostly kept its policy settings on hold, reflecting a more cautious view on growth and inflation. 
 
 Impact of Market Interest Rates 
 Market interest rates are a key driver of our results. Increases and decreases in such rates, as well as extended periods of stagnation, may impact our business and investments in various ways. For a discussion of the potential impact of low and rising interest rates, and inflation, as well as management actions taken in response to the changing U.S. interest rate environment, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Industry Trends Impact of Market Interest Rates and Risk Factors Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks included in the 2023 Annual Report.

 Regulatory Developments 
 The following discussion on regulatory developments should be read in conjunction with Business Regulation and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Industry Trends Regulatory Developments included in the 2023 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented here. 
 State Insurance Regulation 
 Surplus and Capital 
 Investments 
 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC is focused on enhancing regulatory oversight of insurers investments in complex assets, such as structured securities. In connection with evaluating the risks of investing in leveraged loans and collateralized loan obligations CLOs ), the NAIC adopted an amendment to the Purposes and Procedures Manual in 2023. Under the amendment, the NAIC Structured Securities Group SSG will assign risk weights to CLOs based on its own modeling, as opposed to credit ratings. The SSG will model CLO investments and evaluate tranche level losses across all debt tranches under a series of calibrated and weighted collateral stress scenarios to assign NAIC designations that minimize risk-based capital RBC arbitrage. The NAIC s goal is to ensure that the aggregate RBC factor for owning all tranches of a CLO is similar to that required for owning all of the underlying loan collateral. In August 2024, the NAIC adopted an amendment to the Purposes and Procedures Manual, in which insurers are now required to begin reporting the financially modeled NAIC designations for CLOs with their year-end 2025 financial statement filings. The NAIC is collaborating with interested parties to refine the process for modeling CLO investments. 
 Innovation and Technology 
 The NAIC and state insurance regulators have been focused on addressing unfair discrimination in the use of consumer data and technology, and some states have passed laws targeting unfair discrimination practices. In July 2024, the New York State Department of Financial Services released its final circular letter focused on how insurers should develop and manage their use of external consumer data and artificial intelligence AI systems in underwriting and pricing so as not to harm consumers. 
 The European Union s Artificial Intelligence Act EU AI Act has been enacted and entered into force in August 2024. Most of the provisions of the EU AI Act will apply starting August 2026, however certain key provisions will apply earlier, including the EU AI Act s prohibition of certain unacceptable AI practices. The EU AI Act seeks to ensure AI systems are safe while boosting innovation and ensuring fundamental rights are not infringed by the technology. We continue to monitor the developments of the EU AI Act and other governmental initiatives around the world, particularly in jurisdictions where we operate. 
 Standards of Conduct, ERISA, Fiduciary Considerations, and Other Pension and Retirement Regulation 
 In 2023, the U.S. Department of Labor (the DOL proposed a regulation to change the definition of fiduciary for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA and parallel provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), when a financial professional, including an insurance producer, provides investment advice, and to amend various existing prohibited transaction exemptions PTEs that financial professionals rely on when making recommendations. On April 23, 2024, the DOL finalized and published this new definition of fiduciary for purposes of ERISA and parallel provisions of the Code and finalized and published amendments to these PTEs. Shortly thereafter, these changes were challenged in court, including by a coalition of insurance industry trade associations that filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the amendments. In July 2024, two federal district courts entered separate stays of the effective date of the new regulation regarding the definition of fiduciary and the amendments to the PTEs, pending further orders of the courts. We are evaluating the potential impact of these developments on our business, particularly as it pertains to the sale of insurance, annuity and welfare benefit products to retirement investors.

 Management of Climate Risk 
 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC is also continuing its focus on climate, and environmental, social and governance ESG risks and opportunities and has published its rulemaking list which contains certain ESG-related rulemakings that the SEC is considering. In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules requiring registrants to provide additional climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports, including in their financial statements. The final rules set forth requirements for disclosure of material climate-related risks, mitigation activities, targets and goals, and governance. The rules also require disclosure of certain greenhouse gas emissions metrics and attestation of emissions disclosures. In addition, the final rules require disclosure of information relating to the financial statement effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions. The rules include a phased-in compliance period beginning with the 2025 fiscal year for large accelerated reporting companies, including MetLife, Inc. Multiple parties initiated litigation challenging the final rules, and in April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the final rules pending completion of judicial review. In 2022, the SEC also proposed rules requiring registered investment companies, business development companies, and registered and certain unregistered investment advisers to disclose in their fund prospectuses, annual reports and Form ADV information about how funds and advisers incorporate ESG factors into their investment strategies. 
 
 Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining: 
 (i) future policy benefit liabilities, market risk benefits MRBs and the accounting for reinsurance; 
 (ii) estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values; 
 (iii) investment allowance for credit loss ACL and impairments; 
 (iv) estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives; 
 (v) measurement of goodwill and related impairment; 
 (vi) measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities; 
 (vii) measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and 
 (viii) liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters. 
 In addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical accounting estimates. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 The Company s critical accounting estimates are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates and Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 Goodwill 
 Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. 
 For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, the Company will consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying value of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected adjusted earnings, current book value, the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business, long-term growth rates, comparative market multiples, the account value of in-force business, projections of new and renewed business, as well as margins on such business, interest rate levels, credit spreads, equity market levels, and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit.

Table of Contents 

 We apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent reasonable expectations regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based may differ from actual future results. The estimated fair value of the reporting units tested can be impacted by unexpected changes in the legislative, regulatory and macroeconomic environment. Declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment tests on all reporting units using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The quantitative assessment utilized the market multiple or embedded value approaches, and, when appropriate, was supplemented with a discounted cash flow valuation based on best available data as of June 30, 2024. The Company concluded that the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.

 Investments 
 
 Overview 
 We maintain a diversified global general account investment portfolio to support our mix of liabilities in our global businesses. We position our portfolio based on relative value and our view of the economy and financial markets. We maintain our focus on appropriate level of diversification and asset quality. 
 We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined asset/liability management ALM principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with the vast majority of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities available-for-sale AFS and mortgage loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities. 
 
 Current Environment 
 As a global insurance company, we continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment, the fiscal and monetary policy of governments and central banks around the world and other governmental measures. Global inflation, supply chain disruptions, acts of war and banking sector volatility continue to impact the global economy and financial markets and have caused volatility in the global equity, credit and real estate markets. See Industry Trends Financial and Economic Environment for further information regarding conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally which may affect us. These factors may persist for some time and may continue to impact pricing levels of risk-bearing investments, as well as our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives. Rising market interest rates have impacted our investment portfolio and derivatives. See Results of Operations Consolidated Results and Results of Operations Consolidated Results Adjusted Earnings for impacts on our derivatives and analysis of the period over period changes in investment portfolio results and Investments Fixed Maturity Securities AFS Evaluation of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS for Credit Loss Evaluation of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS in an Unrealized Loss Position in Note 10 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for impacts on the net unrealized gain (loss) on our fixed maturity securities AFS. 
 Selected Country Investments 
 We have a market presence in numerous countries and, therefore, our investment portfolio, which supports our insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities, as well as our global portfolio diversification objectives, is exposed to risks posed by local political and economic conditions. The countries included in the following table have been the most affected by these risks. The table below presents a summary of selected country fixed maturity securities AFS, at estimated fair value, on a country of risk basis (i.e., where the issuer primarily conducts business).

 (1) We calculate annualized yields using adjusted net investment income as a percent of average quarterly asset carrying values. Adjusted net investment income excludes realized gains (losses) from sales and disposals, and includes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Asset carrying values utilized in the calculation of yields exclude unrecognized unrealized gains (losses), mortgage loans originated for third parties, collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, annuities funding structured settlement claims, freestanding derivative assets, collateral received from derivative counterparties and contractholder-directed equity securities. Invested assets reclassified to held-for-sale and ceded policy loans are included in the calculation of yields, but are otherwise excluded from asset carrying values. A yield is not presented for other invested assets, as it is not considered a meaningful measure of performance for this asset class.

 Net Investment Gains (Losses) 
 We purchase investments to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. Changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of provision for credit loss and impairments on our investment portfolio, as well as realized gains and losses on investments sold. 
 See Results of Operations Consolidated Results for an analysis of the period over period changes in realized gains (losses) on investments sold, provision (release) for credit loss and impairments and non-investment portfolio gains (losses).

 The majority of the Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities were concentrated in three sectors at September 30, 2024: foreign corporate securities, U.S. corporate securities and ABS CLO. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS increased by 608 million, or 1.7 . The increase was driven by purchases in excess of sales and an increase in estimated fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), offset by transfers out of Level 3 in excess of transfers into Level 3. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS increased by 2.8 billion, or 8.5 . The increase was driven by purchases in excess of sales and an increase in estimated fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), offset by transfers out of Level 3 in excess of transfers into Level 3.

 NRSRO ratings and NAIC designations are as of the dates shown below. Over time, credit ratings and designations can migrate, up or down, through the NRSRO s and NAIC s continuous monitoring process. NRSRO ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings. If no NRSRO rating is available, then an internally developed rating is used. If no NAIC designation is available, then, as permitted by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used. NAIC designations are generally similar to the credit quality ratings of the NRSRO, except for (i) non-agency RMBS and CMBS and (ii) securities rated Ca or C by NRSROs, included within Caa and lower, that are designated NAIC 6; accordingly, NAIC designations may not correspond to NRSRO ratings.

 Securities Lending Transactions, Repurchase Agreements and Third-Party Custodian Administered Programs 
 We participate in securities lending transactions, repurchase agreements and third-party custodian administered programs with unaffiliated financial institutions in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio. 
 Securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements: We account for these arrangements as secured borrowings and record a liability in the amount of the cash received. We obtain collateral, usually cash, from the borrower, which must be returned to the borrower when the securities are returned to us. Through these arrangements, we were liable for cash collateral under our control of 14.2 billion and 13.8 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, including a portion that may require the immediate return of cash collateral we hold. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Investments Securities Lending Transactions and Repurchase Agreements in Note 1 and Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 Annual Report for further information about the secured borrowings accounting and the classification of revenues and expenses. 
 Third-party custodian administered programs: The estimated fair value of securities we own which are loaned in connection with these programs was 650 million and 362 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The estimated fair value of the related non-cash collateral on deposit with third-party custodians on our behalf, which is not reflected in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements and cannot be sold or re-pledged, was 675 million and 371 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Our commercial mortgage loan investments are well positioned with exposures concentrated in high quality underlying properties located in primary markets typically with institutional investors who are better positioned to manage their assets during periods of market volatility. Our portfolio is comprised primarily of lower risk loans with higher debt service coverage ratios DSCR and lower loan-to-value LTV ratios, as shown below. 
 Credit Quality Monitoring Process. We monitor our mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, including a review by credit quality indicator and by the performance indicators of current, past due, restructured and under foreclosure. See below for further information on net mortgage loans by credit quality indicator. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information by performance indicator. 
 We review our commercial mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, LTV ratios, DSCR and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher LTV ratios and lower DSCR. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loan investments is generally similar, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as loans with higher LTV ratios. Agricultural mortgage loan investments are reviewed on an ongoing basis which include property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, LTV ratios and borrower creditworthiness, including reviews on a geographic and property-type basis. We review our residential mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as nonperforming loans. See Notes 1 and 10 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our evaluation of residential mortgage loan investments and related ACL methodology.

 LTV ratios and DSCR are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loan investments. LTV ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loan investments. LTV ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. An LTV ratio greater than 100 indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. An LTV ratio of less than 100 indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. Generally, the higher the LTV ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The DSCR compares a property s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. Generally, the lower the DSCR, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. For our net commercial mortgage loans, our average LTV ratio was 68 and 64 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and our average DSCR was 2.2x and 2.3x at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The DSCR and the values utilized in calculating the ratio are updated routinely. In addition, the LTV ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of our ongoing review of our commercial mortgage loan investments. For our net agricultural mortgage loans, our average LTV ratio was 47 at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The values utilized in calculating our agricultural mortgage loan investments LTV ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of our portfolio and are routinely updated. 
 The distribution of our net commercial mortgage loan portfolios totaling 50.5 billion at amortized cost at September 30, 2024 by key credit quality indicators of LTV and DSCR was as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 DSCR LTV > 1.2x

 September 30, 2024 LTV Total 
 80 0.5 Total 100.0 
 Mortgage Loan Allowance for Credit Loss. Our ACL is established for both pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and for mortgage loan investments with dissimilar risk characteristics, such as collateral dependent loans, individually and on a loan specific basis. We record an allowance for expected lifetime credit loss in earnings within net investment gains (losses) in an amount that represents the portion of the amortized cost basis of mortgage loan investments that the Company does not expect to collect, resulting in mortgage loan investments being presented at the net amount expected to be collected. 
 In determining our ACL, management (i) pools mortgage loans that share similar risk characteristics, (ii) considers expected lifetime credit loss over contractual terms of mortgage loans, as adjusted for expected prepayments and any extensions, and (iii) considers past events and current and forecasted economic conditions. Actual credit loss realized could be different from the amount of the ACL recorded. These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, which can cause the ACL to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. Negative credit migration, including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans, will result in an increase in the ACL. Positive credit migration, including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans, will result in a decrease in the ACL. See Notes 1 and 10 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on how the ACL is established and monitored, and activity in and balances of the ACL.

 Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures 
 Our real estate investments are comprised of wholly-owned properties, and interests in both real estate joint ventures and real estate funds which invest in a wide variety of properties and property types, including single and multi-property projects, and are broadly diversified across multiple property types and geographies. 
 The carrying value of our real estate investments was 13.7 billion and 13.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, or 2.9 of cash and invested assets at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Our real estate investments are typically stabilized properties that we intend to hold for the longer-term for portfolio diversification and long-term appreciation. Our real estate investment portfolio had appreciated to a 3.8 billion unrealized gain position at September 30, 2024. 
 We continuously monitor and assess our real estate investments for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the real estate may be impaired. As a result of our impairment analyses, we recorded impairment (loss) of 17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There was no impairment (loss) recognized on our real estate investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We diversify our real estate investments by property type, form of equity interest (wholly-owned, joint venture and funds) and geographic region to reduce risk of concentration. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our real estate investments, by income type, as well as income earned. 
 
 Other Limited Partnership Interests 
 Other limited partnership interests are comprised of investments in private funds, including private equity funds and hedge funds. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of other limited partnership interests was 14.2 billion and 14.8 billion, which included 18 million and 27 million of hedge funds, respectively. Other limited partnership interests were 3.0 and 3.2 of cash and invested assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Cash distributions on these investments are generated from investment gains, operating income from the underlying investments of the funds and liquidation of the underlying investments of the funds. 
 We use the equity method of accounting for most of our private equity funds. We generally recognize our share of a private equity fund s earnings in net investment income on a three-month lag, which is when the information is reported to us. Accordingly, changes in equity market levels, which can impact the underlying results of these private equity funds, are recognized in earnings within our net investment income on a three-month lag.

 Derivatives 
 Overview 
 We are exposed to various risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market. We use a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives, such as market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for: 
 A comprehensive description of the nature of our derivatives, including the strategies for which derivatives are used in managing various risks.

See also Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Management of Market Risk Exposures Hedging Activities in the 2023 Annual Report for more information about our use of derivatives by major hedge program. 
 Net Derivative Gains (Losses) 
 A portion of our derivatives are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those derivatives not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. We actively evaluate market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure our free cash flow and capital objectives are met under a range of market conditions. 
 Certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits are accounted for as MRBs and measured at estimated fair value. We use freestanding derivatives to hedge the market risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. 
 We continuously review and refine our hedging strategy in light of changing economic and market conditions, evolving NAIC and the New York Department of Financial Services statutory requirements, and accounting rule changes. As a part of our current hedging strategy, we maintain portfolio level derivatives in our macro hedge program. These macro hedge program derivatives mitigate the potential deterioration in our capital positions from significant adverse economic conditions.

 The Company 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity refers to the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs. In the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs, we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These available alternatives include cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets, global funding sources including commercial paper and various credit and committed facilities. 
 Capital 
 We manage our capital position to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings. Our capital position is supported by our ability to generate strong cash flows within our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates, as well as by our demonstrated ability to raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs despite adverse market and economic conditions.

 Cash Flows from Operations 
 The principal cash inflows from our insurance activities come from insurance premiums, net investment income, annuity considerations and deposit funds. The principal cash outflows are the result of various life insurance, annuity and pension products, operating expenses and income tax, as well as interest expense. 
 Cash Flows from Investments 
 The principal cash inflows from our investment activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and settlements of freestanding derivatives. The principal cash outflows relate to purchases of investments, issuances of policy loans and settlements of freestanding derivatives. In addition, cash inflows and outflows relate to sales and purchases of businesses. We typically have a net cash outflow from investing activities because cash inflows from insurance operations are reinvested in accordance with our ALM discipline to fund insurance liabilities. We closely monitor and manage these risks through our comprehensive investment risk management process. 
 Cash Flows from Financing 
 The principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt and other securities, deposits of funds associated with PABs and lending of securities. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt and the collateral financing arrangement, payments of dividends on and repurchases or redemptions of MetLife, Inc. s securities, withdrawals associated with PABs and the return of securities on loan.

 Liquidity and Capital Sources 
 Liquidity and capital are provided by a variety of global funding sources, including: (i) preferred and common stock; (ii) short-term debt, which includes commercial paper; (iii) long-term debt; collateral financing arrangement; and junior subordinated debt securities; (iv) PABs, which includes funding agreements; (v) credit and committed facilities; (vi) shelf registration statement, which permits the issuance of public debt, equity and hybrid securities and provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing and has no stated issuance capacity; and (vii) dispositions. Additional details regarding certain of our primary sources of liquidity and capital are included in the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 Annual Report referenced in Overview and are discussed below. 
 The diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one market or source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. We have no reason to believe that our lending counterparties will be unable to fulfill their respective contractual obligations under our credit and committed facilities. As commitments under these facilities may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements. 
 Credit and Committed Facilities 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company maintained its unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ), as well as certain committed facilities (the Committed Facilities ). When drawn upon, these facilities bear interest at varying rates in accordance with the respective agreements.

Additional details regarding certain of our primary uses of liquidity and capital are included in the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 Annual Report referenced in Overview and are discussed below. 
 Common Stock Repurchases and Dividends 
 Among other factors that could restrict MetLife, Inc. s ability to repurchase or pay dividends on its common stock are the dividend stopper provisions in MetLife, Inc. s preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company Liquidity and Capital Uses Dividend Stopper Provisions in MetLife s Preferred Stock and Junior Subordinated Debentures included in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MetLife, Inc. paid dividends on its preferred stock of 168 million and 165 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, MetLife, Inc. paid dividends on its common stock of 1.1 billion and 1.2 billion, respectively. 
 Debt Repurchases, Redemptions and Exchanges 
 We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, redemptions and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases, redemptions, or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions, and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not to repurchase or redeem any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases or redemptions will be determined at our discretion. 
 Pledged Collateral 
 We pledge collateral to, and have collateral pledged to us by counterparties in connection with our derivatives, the collateral financing arrangement related to the reinsurance of closed block liabilities, and with funding and advance agreements. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding derivatives.

 Mortgage Loan Secured Financing 
 See Investments Net Mortgage Loans. 
 Insurance Liabilities 
 Liabilities arising from our insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under various life insurance, annuity and group pension products, as well as payments for policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans. For annuity or deposit type products, surrender or lapse behavior differs somewhat by segment. In the MetLife Holdings segment, which includes individual annuities, lapses and surrenders tend to occur in the normal course of business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general account surrenders and withdrawals from annuity products were 1.3 billion and 1.4 billion, respectively. In the RIS segment, which includes pension risk transfers, bank-owned life insurance and other fixed annuity contracts, as well as funding agreements and other capital market products, most of the products offered have fixed maturities or fairly predictable surrenders or withdrawals. With regard to the RIS business products that provide customers with limited rights to accelerate payments, at September 30, 2024, there were funding agreements totaling 127 million that could be put back to the Company.

 MetLife, Inc. 
 Liquidity and Capital Management 
 Liquidity and capital are managed to preserve stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash to meet all current and future financial obligations and are provided by a variety of sources, including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified mix of short- and long-term funding sources from the wholesale financial markets and the ability to borrow through credit and committed facilities. Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on MetLife, Inc. s liquidity. MetLife, Inc. is an active participant in the global financial markets through which it obtains a significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of MetLife, Inc. s liquidity and capital management. Decisions to access these markets are based upon relative costs, prospective views of balance sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile and capital structure. A disruption in the financial markets could limit MetLife, Inc. s access to liquidity. 
 MetLife, Inc. s ability to maintain regular access to competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies. We view our capital ratios, credit quality, stable and diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity sources and our liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining such credit ratings. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company Rating Agencies included in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 Liquid Assets 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, MetLife holding companies had 4.5 billion and 5.2 billion, respectively, in liquid assets. Of these amounts, 3.6 billion and 4.2 billion were held by MetLife, Inc. and 911 million and 1.0 billion were held by other MetLife holding companies at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with derivatives and the collateral financing arrangement. 
 Liquid assets held in non-U.S. holding companies are generated in part through dividends from non-U.S. insurance operations. Such dividends are subject to local insurance regulatory requirements, as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Sources Dividends from Subsidiaries. 
 See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Company Outlook included in the 2023 Annual Report for the targeted level of liquid assets at the holding companies. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources MetLife, Inc. Liquid Assets included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information on the sources and uses of liquid assets, as well as sources and uses of liquid assets included in free cash flow for MetLife, Inc. and other MetLife holding companies. 
 Liquidity and Capital Sources 
 MetLife, Inc. s primary sources of liquidity and capital are provided by a variety of global funding sources, including: (i) dividends from subsidiaries; (ii) issuances of long-term debt; (iii) collateral financing arrangement and junior subordinated debentures; (iv) credit and committed facilities; and (v) dispositions. Additional details regarding certain of MetLife, Inc. s primary sources of liquidity and capital are included in The Company Liquidity and Capital Sources, the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 Annual Report referenced in Overview and are discussed below. 
 Dividends from Subsidiaries 
 MetLife, Inc. relies, in part, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements. MetLife, Inc. s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their respective domiciles. The dividend limitation for U.S. insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the surplus to policyholders at the end of the immediately preceding calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which we conduct business, differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the treatment of DAC, certain deferred income tax, required investment liabilities, statutory reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes.

Table of Contents 

 The table below sets forth the dividends permitted to be paid in 2024 by MetLife, Inc. s primary U.S. insurance subsidiaries without insurance regulatory approval and the actual dividends paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Company Paid (1) Permitted Without Approval (2) (In millions) MLIC 2,738 3,476 American Life Insurance Company 1,090 945 Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company 184 373 
 __________________ 
 (1) Reflects all amounts paid, including those where regulatory approval was obtained as required. 
 (2) Reflects dividend amounts that may be paid during 2024 without prior regulatory approval. However, because dividend tests may be based on dividends previously paid over rolling 12-month periods, if paid before a specified date during 2024, some or all of such dividends may require regulatory approval. 
 In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, MetLife, Inc. also received from certain other subsidiaries cash dividends of 29 million, as well as cash returns of capital of 16 million. 
 The dividend capacity of our non-U.S. operations is subject to similar restrictions established by the local regulators. The non-U.S. regulatory regimes also commonly limit dividend payments to the parent company to a portion of the subsidiary s prior year statutory income, as determined by the local accounting principles. The regulators of our non-U.S. operations, including Japan s Financial Services Agency, may also limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers are deemed to be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of the non-U.S. operations, or for other reasons. Most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are second tier subsidiaries which are owned by various non-U.S. holding companies. The capital and rating considerations applicable to our first-tier subsidiaries may also impact the dividend flow into MetLife, Inc. 
 We proactively manage target and excess capital levels and dividend flows and forecast local capital positions as part of the financial planning cycle. The dividend capacity of certain U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries is also subject to business targets in excess of the minimum capital necessary to maintain the desired rating or level of financial strength in the relevant market. 
 Long-term Debt Outstanding 
 The following table summarizes the outstanding long-term debt of MetLife, Inc. at: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In millions) Long-term debt unaffiliated 
 14,594 14,516 Long-term debt affiliated 
 1,566 1,585 Junior subordinated debt securities 2,470 2,468 
 Liquidity and Capital Uses 
 MetLife, Inc. s primary uses of liquidity and capital include: (i) debt service; (ii) cash dividends on common and preferred stock; (iii) capital contributions to subsidiaries; (iv) common stock, preferred stock and debt repurchases and/or redemptions; (v) payment of general operating expenses; (vi) support agreements; and (vii) acquisitions. Additional details regarding certain of MetLife, Inc. s primary uses of liquidity and capital are included in The Company Liquidity and Capital Uses, the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 Annual Report referenced in Overview and are discussed below. 
 Based on our analysis and comparison of our current and future cash inflows from the dividends we receive from subsidiaries that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval, our investment portfolio and other cash flows and anticipated access to the capital markets, we believe there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable MetLife, Inc. to make payments on debt, pay cash dividends on its common and preferred stock, contribute capital to its subsidiaries, repurchase its common stock and certain of its other securities, pay all general operating expenses and meet its cash needs under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios.

 Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures 
 In this report, the Company presents certain measures of its performance on a consolidated and segment basis that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding for the Company and our investors of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. Segment-specific financial measures are calculated using only the portion of consolidated results attributable to that specific segment. 
 The following non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP: 
 Non-GAAP financial measures: Comparable GAAP financial measures: (i) adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues 
 (i) premiums, fees and other revenues 
 (ii) adjusted earnings (ii) net income (loss) (iii) adjusted earnings available to common shareholders (iii) net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc. s common shareholders (iv) adjusted net investment income (iv) net investment income 
 Any of these financial measures shown on a constant currency basis reflect the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates for the current period and applied to the comparable prior period constant currency basis ). 
 Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures are included in Results of Operations and Investments. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible without unreasonable effort to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range and from period to period and may have a material impact on net income. 
 Our definitions of non-GAAP and other financial measures discussed in this report may differ from those used by other companies. 
 Adjusted earnings and related measures: 
 adjusted earnings; 
 adjusted earnings available to common shareholders; and 
 adjusted earnings available to common shareholders on a constant currency basis. 
 154 

Table of Contents 

 These measures are used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings and components of, or other financial measures based on, adjusted earnings are also our GAAP measures of segment performance. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings are also the measures by which senior management s and many other employees performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results. 
 Adjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, net of income tax. Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders is defined as adjusted earnings less preferred stock dividends. For additional information relating to adjusted earnings, see Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies in Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In addition, adjusted earnings available to common shareholders excludes the impact of preferred stock redemption premium, which is reported as a reduction to net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc. s common shareholders. 
 Return on equity, allocated equity and related measures: 
 Total MetLife, Inc. s common stockholders equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments FCTA ), is defined as total MetLife, Inc. s common stockholders equity, excluding the net unrealized investment gains (losses), future policy benefits discount rate remeasurement gains (losses), MRBs instrument-specific credit risk remeasurement gains (losses) and defined benefit plans adjustment components of AOCI, net of income tax. 
 Return on MetLife, Inc. s common stockholders equity: net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc. s common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc. s average common stockholders equity. 
 Adjusted return on MetLife, Inc. s common stockholders equity: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc. s average common stockholders equity. 
 Adjusted return on MetLife, Inc. s common stockholders equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc. s average common stockholders equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA. 
 Allocated equity is the portion of MetLife, Inc. s common stockholders equity that management allocates to each of its segments based on local capital requirements and economic capital. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Economic Capital in the 2023 Annual Report. Allocated equity excludes the impact of AOCI other than FCTA. 
 The above measures represent a level of equity consistent with the view that, in the ordinary course of business, we do not plan to sell most investments for the sole purpose of realizing gains or losses. 
 Expense ratio and direct expense ratio: 
 Expense ratio: other expenses, net of capitalization of DAC, divided by premiums, fees and other revenues. 
 Direct expense ratio: adjusted direct expenses divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues. Direct expenses are comprised of employee-related costs, third-party staffing costs, and general and administrative expenses. 
 Direct expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses and pension risk transfers: adjusted direct expenses excluding total notable items related to direct expenses, divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding pension risk transfers. 
 The following additional information is relevant to an understanding of our performance results and outlook: 
 We sometimes refer to sales activity for various products. These sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of business activity. Further, sales statistics for our Latin America, Asia and EMEA segments are on a constant currency basis. 
 Near-term represents one to three years. 
 155 

Table of Contents 

 Notable items reflect the unexpected impact of events that affect the Company s results, but that were unknown and that the Company could not anticipate when it devised its business plan. Notable items also include certain items regardless of the extent anticipated in the business plan, to help investors have a better understanding of MetLife s results and to evaluate and forecast those results. Notable items represent a positive (negative) impact to adjusted earnings available to common shareholders. 
 The Company uses a measure of free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of its ability to generate cash for reinvestment into its businesses or use in non-mandatory capital actions. The Company defines free cash flow as the sum of cash available at MetLife s holding companies from dividends from operating subsidiaries, expenses and other net flows of the holding companies (including capital contributions to subsidiaries), and net contributions from debt to be at or below target leverage ratios. This measure of free cash flow is prior to capital actions, such as common stock dividends and repurchases, debt reduction and mergers and acquisitions. Free cash flow should not be viewed as a substitute for net cash provided by (used in) operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP. The free cash flow ratio is typically expressed as a percentage of annual adjusted earnings available to common shareholders. 
 For further detail relating to total adjusted revenues and total adjusted expenses, as set forth in Results of Operations Segment Results and Corporate Other, see total revenues and total expenses, respectively, within the tables in Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies in Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We regularly analyze our exposure to interest rate, equity market price and foreign currency exchange rate risks. As a result of that analysis, we have determined that the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities are materially exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the equity markets. We have exposure to such market risks through our insurance operations and investment activities. We use a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives. A description of our market risk exposures may be found under Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in the 2023 Annual Report. There have been no material changes to our market risk exposures from those previously disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report.

 address redacted 
 
 Dear Shurawl, 
 
 I am pleased to offer you the following sign-on payments in connection with the beginning of your employment with MetLife Group, Inc. in the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, as approved by MetLife Inc. s Compensation Committee and Board of Directors. 
 Sign-on Payments 
 Based on the information you provided us, we understand you will forfeit certain compensation awards from your current employer if you accept employment with us. With the understanding you will be joining MetLife on or near August 1, 2024, and as a result will be considered for MetLife incentive compensation awards for this performance year on a prorated basis, and other considerations, MetLife s Compensation Committee and Board of Directors has approved that you be offered the following one-time cash payments, subject to appropriate verification of loss forfeiture and your beginning of employment with MetLife 
 
 550,000 payable to you in January 2025, to help address forfeiture of your unvested LTI. 
 
 480,000 payable to you in March 2025, to address forfeiture of your partial performance year 2024 cash incentive. 
 
 370,000 payable to you in February 2026, to help address forfeiture of your unvested LTI. 
 
 Each of these cash sign-on payments will be paid to you in a lump sum less applicable taxes and other required withholding. Payments will be made to you only if you maintain continuous employment and satisfactory performance (as determined in MetLife s sole discretion) through each payable date. To the extent your current employer pays or credits you for any amounts that these grants or payments are intended to cover, MetLife will reduce the payment. In each case of the above cash sign-on payments, in the event that you voluntarily terminate your employment for any reason whatsoever, or your employment is terminated for cause, within 24 months following each payable date, you must repay the full amount of each payment to MetLife to the extent permissible under law. You may not defer these payments. Termination for cause is defined under the MetLife, Inc. 2015 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan. 
 1 

Other Terms 
 
 This is not an employment contract, and does not represent a guarantee of continued employment for any period of time. Employment at MetLife is employment at will, which means that either you or MetLife may terminate the relationship at any time with or without cause or notice. For the avoidance of doubt, this letter supersedes any and all other correspondence or oral statements previously provided to you on the subject of sign-on payments from MetLife, and such other correspondence or statements are hereby null and void and of no further effect. 

Sincerely, I accept this offer.
