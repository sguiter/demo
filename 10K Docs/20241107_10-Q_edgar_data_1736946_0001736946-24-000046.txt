 Litigation and Other Legal Matters 
 
 We are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. In all cases, at each reporting period, we evaluate whether or not a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable under the provisions of the authoritative guidance that addresses accounting for contingencies. In such cases, we accrue for the amount or, if a range, we accrue the low end of the range, only if there is not a better estimate than any other amount within the range, as a component of legal expense within general and administrative expenses. We monitor developments in these legal matters that could affect the estimate we had previously accrued. In relation to such matters, we currently believe that there are no existing claims or proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position within the next 12 months, or the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments, which could have an adverse effect in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses. 
 
 Indemnifications 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to customers, distributors, resellers, vendors, lessors, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising from breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with members of our board of directors and certain of our executive officers that require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnification obligations and we are not currently aware of any indemnification claims.

For RSUs and PSUs vested prior to September 29, 2024, the tax withholding method is the net withholding method, in which shares with a market value equivalent to the tax withholding obligation are withheld and the net shares are issued to the RSU and PSU holders. Effective the fourth quarter of 2024, the tax withholding policy changed and our Named Executive Officers NEOs will use the sell-to-cover method for their tax withholding, in which shares with a market value equivalent to the tax withholding obligation are sold on behalf of the NEOs of their RSUs and PSUs upon vesting and settlement to cover the tax withholding liability, and the cash proceeds from such sales are remitted by Arlo to taxing authorities. The sell-to-cover method will apply to all Arlo employees effective on January 1, 2025.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this Quarterly Report. Unless expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms we, our, us, the Company, and Arlo refer to Arlo Technologies, Inc. and our subsidiaries. 

Business and Executive Overview 
 
 Arlo is transforming the ways in which people can protect everything that matters to them with advanced home, business, and personal security services that combine a globally scaled cloud platform, advanced monitoring and analytics capabilities, and award-winning app-controlled devices to create a personalized security ecosystem. Arlo s deep expertise in cloud services, cutting-edge AI and computer vision analytics, wireless connectivity and intuitive user experience design delivers seamless, smart home security for Arlo users that is easy to setup and engage with every day. Our highly secure, cloud-based platform provides users with visibility, insight and a powerful means to help protect and connect in real-time with the people and things that matter most, from any location with a Wi-Fi or a cellular connection all rooted in a commitment to safeguard privacy for our users and their personal data. 
 
 Since the launch of our first product in December 2014, we have shipped over 36.1 million smart connected devices. As of September 29, 2024, the Arlo platform had approximately 10.4 million cumulative registered accounts across more than 100 countries around the world coupled with approximately 4.2 million cumulative paid subscribers and annual recurring revenue of 241.6 million. 
 
 We conduct business across three geographic regions (i) the Americas; (ii) Europe, Middle-East and Africa EMEA and (iii) Asia Pacific APAC and we primarily generate revenue by selling devices through retail, wholesale distribution, security solution providers, Arlo s direct to consumer store and paid subscription services. For the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, we generated total revenue of 137.7 million and 130.0 million, respectively, and loss from operations was 5.5 million and 2.3 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, we generated total revenue of 389.3 million and 356.1 million, respectively, and loss from operations was 28.9 million and 24.4 million, respectively. 
 
 Our goal is to continue to develop innovative, world-class smart security solutions to expand and further monetize our current and future user and paid account bases. We believe that the growth of our business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to innovate and launch successful new products on a timely basis and grow our installed base, to increase subscription-based recurring revenue, to invest in channel partnerships and to continue our global expansion. We expect to increase our investment in research and development going forward as we continue to introduce new and

 innovative products and services to enhance the Arlo platform and compete for engineering talent. We also expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in the future as we invest in marketing to drive demand for our products and services. 
 
 Key Business Metrics 
 
 In addition to the measures presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts and make strategic decisions. We believe these key business metrics provide useful information by offering the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our on-going operating results and a better understanding of how management plans and measures our underlying business. Our key business metrics may be calculated in a manner different from the same key business metrics used by other companies. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we may discover a need to make adjustments to better reflect our business or to improve their accuracy, including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics. We believe that any such inaccuracies or adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated. 
 As of 
 September 29, 2024 Change October 1, 2023 (In thousands, except percentage data) Cumulative registered accounts 10,383 26.7 8,193 Cumulative paid accounts (1) 
 4,235 70.4 2,486 Annual recurring revenue ARR (2)

 _________________________ 
 (1) The number of cumulative paid accounts as of September 29, 2024 included paid accounts managed by Verisure S rl Verisure in our EMEA region which are now onboarded with us. This does not have an impact to our financial statements and key business metrics other than our number of cumulative paid accounts. 
 
 (2) As described further below, in the first fiscal quarter of 2024, we changed the methodology on paid service revenue recognition from a mid-month convention to a daily recognition model. As a result, ARR as of September 29, 2024 was calculated using the daily recognition model while ARR as of October 1, 2023 was calculated using our former methodology, the mid-month convention. ARR as of October 1, 2023 calculated using the daily recognition model does not represent a material change from the mid-month convention over the same period. 
 
 Cumulative Registered Accounts . We believe that our ability to increase our user base is an indicator of our market penetration and growth of our business as we continue to expand and innovate our Arlo platform. We define our registered accounts at the end of a particular period as the number of unique registered accounts on the Arlo platform as of the end of such period. The number of registered accounts does not necessarily reflect the number of end-users on the Arlo platform as one registered account may be used by multiple end-users to monitor the devices attached to that household. 
 
 Cumulative Paid Accounts . Paid accounts are defined as any account worldwide where a subscription to a paid service is being collected (either by us or by our customers or channel partners, including Verisure). 
 
 Annual Recurring Revenue . We believe ARR enables measurement of our business initiatives and serves as an indicator of our future growth. ARR represents the amount of paid service revenue that we expect to recur annually. In the first fiscal quarter of 2024, we changed the methodology on paid service revenue recognition from a mid-month convention to a daily recognition model which recognizes paid service revenue based on the number of service days within the fiscal reporting period, commencing on the start date of the subscription and continuing over the term of the arrangement. Accordingly, the methodology used to calculate ARR was also changed in the first fiscal quarter of 2024 and is now calculated by taking the average daily paid service revenue of the last calendar month in the fiscal quarter, multiplied by 365 days. We believe the daily recognition model aligns with our customers subscription period and service usage and allows for a more precise measurement of paid service revenue relative to the former methodology of a mid-month convention, which was based on paid service revenue for the last calendar month in the fiscal quarter, multiplied by 12 months. This change in calculation methodology has no material impact on our financial statements or any previously reported ARR numbers. ARR is a performance metric and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue, and is not intended to be a substitute for, or combined with, any of these items.

Impact of Global Geopolitical, Economic and Business Conditions 
 
 During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we remained focused on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, hostilities in the Middle-East, supply chain disruptions, the inflationary macro environment, fluctuating consumer confidence and high interest rates by preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. These actions include, but are not limited to, proactively managing working capital by closely monitoring customers credit and collections, renegotiating payment terms with third-party manufacturers and key suppliers, closely monitoring inventory levels and purchases against forecasted demand, reducing or eliminating non-essential spending, and subleasing or reducing excess office space. We continue to monitor the situation and may, as necessary, reduce expenditures further, borrow under our revolving credit facility, or pursue other sources of capital that may include other forms of external financing in order to maintain our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in response to the uncertainty in the United States and global markets resulting from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, hostilities in the Middle-East, supply chain disruptions, the inflationary macro environment, fluctuating consumer confidence and high interest rates, current financial conditions within the banking industry, including the effects of recent failures of other financial institutions, and liquidity levels.

 Revenue 
 
 Our gross revenue consists primarily of sales of devices and paid subscription service revenue. We generally recognize revenue from product sales at the time the product is shipped and transfer of control from us to the customer occurs. Our paid subscription services are billed in advance of the start of the monthly subscription and revenue is recognized ratably over subscription period. 
 
 Our revenue consists of gross revenue, less customer rebates and other channel sales incentives, allowances for estimated sales returns, price protection, and net changes in deferred revenue. A significant portion of our marketing expenditure is with customers and is deemed to be a reduction of revenue under authoritative guidance for revenue recognition.

We conduct business across three geographic regions (i) the Americas; (ii) EMEA; and (iii) APAC and generally base revenue by geographic region on the bill-to location of the customer.

 Revenue by classification is as follows: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 Change October 1, 2023 September 29, 2024 Change October 1, 2023 (In thousands, except percentage data) Product revenue 75,784 (4.0) 78,961 210,463 (0.1) 210,770 Service revenue 61,883 21.2 51,042 178,851 23.1 145,313 Total revenue 137,667 5.9 130,003 389,314 9.3 356,083 

Product revenue decreased by 3.2 million, or 4.0 , and 0.3 million, or 0.1 , for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the prior year periods, respectively, primarily driven by the decrease in product sales in the Americas and APAC due to seasonality and a reduction in average selling prices ASPs of our products as we increased promotional activities to stimulate household acquisition and subscriber growth. The decline was partially offset by the increase in product shipments in EMEA due to stronger customer demand and the lower sales returns that are deemed to be reductions of revenue. The decrease in product revenue for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 was also offset by the lower sales incentives that are deemed to be reductions of revenue. 
 
 Service revenue increased in all regions by 10.8 million, or 21.2 , and 33.5 million, or 23.1 , for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the prior year periods, respectively, primarily due to a 70.4 increase in cumulative paid accounts and continued increase in average revenue per user ARPU of retail subscriptions. 
 
 Cost of Revenue 
 
 Cost of revenue consists of both product costs and service costs. Product costs primarily consist of the cost of finished products from our third-party manufacturers and overhead costs, including personnel expense for operation staff, purchasing, product planning, inventory control, warehousing and distribution logistics, third-party software licensing fees, inbound freight, IT and facilities overhead, warranty costs associated with returned goods, write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory and excess components, and royalties to third parties. Service costs consist of costs attributable to the provision and maintenance of our cloud-based platform, including personnel, storage, security and computing, IT and facilities overhead. 
 
 Our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue can vary based upon a number of factors, including those that may affect our revenue set forth above and factors that may affect our cost of revenue, including, without limitation, product mix, sales channel mix, registered accounts acceptance of paid subscription service offerings, and changes in our cost of

 goods sold due to fluctuations in prices paid for components, net of vendor rebates, cloud platform costs, warranty and overhead costs, inbound freight and duty costs, and charges for excess or obsolete inventory. We outsource our manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution logistics. We also outsource certain components of the required infrastructure to support our cloud-based back-end IT infrastructure. We believe this outsourcing strategy allows us to better manage our product and service costs and gross margin and allows us to adapt to changing market dynamics and supply chain constraints.

 Product cost of revenue increased by 2.0 and 3.3 for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to a decrease in inventory net realizable value. 
 
 Service cost of revenue increased by 6.7 and 11.0 for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to service revenue growth as a result of the increase in cumulative paid accounts, partially offset by cost optimizations. 
 
 Gross Profit

 Product gross profit decreased by 4.7 million and 6.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods, primarily driven by a reduction in the ASPs of our products as we increased promotional activities to stimulate household acquisition and subscriber growth and an increase in inventory reserves. 
 
 Service gross profit increased by 9.9 million and 29.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to service revenue growth in all regions as a result of increases in cumulative paid accounts, continued increase in ARPU of retail subscriptions, and cost optimizations.

 Operating Expenses 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related expense, safety, security, regulatory services and testing, other research and development consulting fees, and allocated IT and facilities overhead. Generally, we recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. We have invested in and expanded our research and development organization to enhance our ability to introduce innovative products and services. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we develop new product and service offerings and compete for engineering talent. We believe that innovation and technological leadership are critical to our future success, and we are committed to continuing a significant level of research and development to develop new technologies, products, and services, including our hardware devices, cloud-based software, AI-based algorithms, and machine learning capabilities.

 Research and development expense increased by 0.7 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an increase of 1.1 million in personnel-related expenses mainly from stock-based compensation and merit increases, partially offset by a decrease of 0.3 million in corporate IT and facilities overhead. 
 
 Research and development expense increased by 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increases of 5.0 million in personnel-related expenses mainly from stock-based compensation and merit increases, and 0.6 million in professional services. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 
 Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel expense for sales and marketing staff, technical support expense, advertising, trade shows, media and placement, corporate communications and other marketing expense, product marketing expense, allocated IT and facilities overhead, outbound freight costs, and credit card processing fees. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in the future as we invest in marketing to drive demand for our products and services.

 of continued investment in customer experience improvements across customer care and engineering, and 0.8 million in credit card processing fees as a result of increases in paid subscriber accounts, partially offset by a decrease of 1.1 million in freight-out expenses. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expense for certain executives, finance and accounting, investor relations, human resources, legal, information technology, professional fees, allocated IT and facilities overhead, strategic initiative expense, and other general corporate expense. We expect our general and administrative expense to fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue in future periods based on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing of such expense.

 General and administrative expense increased by 14.7 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increases of 11.1 million in personnel-related expenses mainly from stock-based compensation due to the achievement of certain performance-based equity awards target and 3.3 million in legal and professional services. 
 
 Others 
 
 Others include restructuring charges, which consist of severance costs, office exit expense, and other exit expense associated with the abandonment of certain lease contracts and cancellation of contractual services arrangements with certain suppliers. Others also include the write-off of deferred financing and separation related expenses, which consist primarily of costs of legal and professional services.

 The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 was lower than the U.S. federal income tax rate due to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets and certain foreign tax attributes as it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Table of Contents 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 29, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled 146.6 million. We have a history of losses and may incur operating and net losses in the future. As of September 29, 2024, our accumulated deficit was 393.1 million. Historically, we have funded our principal business activities through cash flows generated from operations and available cash on hand. 
 
 Our current revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. matured on October 27, 2024. We are in the final stage of entering into a new credit agreement and a security agreement with HSBC Bank USA, N.A, for a three-year revolving credit facility of 45.0 million with an uncommitted accordion feature of 30.0 million. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 
 We believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months and beyond. However, in the future we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient, we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity. We have no commitments to obtain such additional financing and cannot provide assurance that additional financing will be available at all or, if available, that such financing would be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive. 
 
 Our future liquidity and cash requirements may vary from those currently planned and will depend on numerous factors, including the introduction of new products, the growth in our service revenue, the ability to increase our gross margin dollars, as well as cost optimization initiatives and controls over our operating expenditures. As we grow our installed base and related cost structure, there will be a need for additional working capital, hence, we may increase our product and subscription rates in the future. 
 
 Leases and Contractual Commitments 
 
 Our operating lease obligations mostly include offices, equipment, and distribution centers. Our contractual commitments are primarily inventory-related purchase obligations with suppliers. 
 
 Contingencies 
 
 We are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. We evaluate whether or not a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable under the provisions of the authoritative guidance that addresses accounting for contingencies. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss. In such cases, we accrue for the amount or, if a range, we accrue the low end of the range, only if there is not a better estimate than any other amount within the range, as a component of legal expense within litigation reserves, net. 
 
 Refer to Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report for further information about our operating leases, purchase obligations, and legal contingencies.

 Operating activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 14.3 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to favorable working capital movements as the results of (i) higher accounts payable balances mainly due to timing of the payments and increased marketing expenditures for new products launch and upcoming holiday sales; and (ii) higher accounts receivable balances due to the growth of sales, offset by increased inventory purchases. 
 
 Investing activities 
 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities increased by 57.3 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher proceeds from maturities of short-term investments. 
 
 Financing activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased by 18.6 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the increase in withholding tax from RSU releases, offset by higher proceeds related to employee benefit plans.

 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), has evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, our management, including our CEO and our CFO, has concluded that, due to the material weakness described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 29, 2024 at a reasonable assurance level. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within an organization have been detected. 
 
 Notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below, our management believes that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related financial information included in this Quarterly Report for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates presented, and for the periods ended on such dates, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Previously Reported Material Weaknesses 
 
 As reported in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, in connection with our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, our management identified certain control deficiencies in the area of our Information Technology General Control ITGC related to (i) user access and segregation of duty controls that restrict user and privileged access to appropriate personnel; (ii) program change management controls; and (iii) certain computer operations controls that, when aggregated, arise to a material weakness. 
 
 Management is committed to remediating the material weakness in a timely manner. Our remediation process includes, but is not limited to: (i) increasing timely reviews of information technology system changes made; (ii) rationalizing access privileges for developer system users; (iii) implementing or modifying controls related to program change management and certain computer operations; and (iv) training of relevant personnel on the design and operation of any new or modified ITGCs. These steps are subject to ongoing management review, as well as oversight by the audit committee of our board of directors. 
 
 Status of Remediation Efforts 
 
 Management has implemented measures designed to remediate the material weakness in fiscal year 2024. The remedial measures implemented include but are not limited to: 
 
 Implementation of a software solution to identify and facilitate review of changes made to our Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system via newly designed detective controls to supplement our existing preventative controls.

Table of Contents 

 Implementation of a tool to better monitor access via a secure gateway to our operating systems, as well as better management of credentials across all financially impactful applications and the underlying internally managed infrastructure. 
 
 Enhancement of our user access review procedures to increase scope and precision. 
 
 Minimize number of users with elevated access within our ERP system, limiting sensitive roles to only individuals with functional requirements. 
 
 Redesign and implementation of ITGCs and deployment of additional trainings to further mature the overall control environment. 
 
 We have substantially implemented the remedial measures described above relating to the control deficiencies associated with the previously identified material weakness within the IT function. We believe that upon completion of such measures, we will have strengthened our ITGCs to address and successfully remediate the identified material weakness. However, the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remediated controls are fully implemented and have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through formal testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect to continue to assess their operating effectiveness throughout fiscal 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than the ongoing remediation efforts described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 29, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
