Liquidity and Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and a working capital deficit of . The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. The Company expects that it will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, shareholders, officers, directors or third parties. The Company s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity.

The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable ordinary shares are affected by charges against additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit.

Results of Operations 

We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering described below, and subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for an initial business combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents. Our expenses have increased substantially after the closing of our initial public offering as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 450,355 which consists of interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 435,437 and the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 529,550, offset by operational costs of 514,632.

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern 

Until the consummation of the initial public offering, our only source of liquidity was an initial purchase of Founder Shares by our Former Sponsor, TKB Sponsor, LLC, for 25,000 and a 300,000 loan from our Former Sponsor which has been repaid in full in connection with the closing of the IPO. 

On October 29, 2021, we consummated the initial public offering of 23,000,000 units, at 10.00 per unit, which included the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,000,000 units, generating gross proceeds of 230,000,000. 

Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 10,750,000 warrants to our sponsor at a purchase price of 1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 10,750,000. 

A total of 234,600,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants were placed in a U.S.-based Trust Account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, acting as trustee. 

28 

Transaction costs of the initial public offering amounted to 21,140,059, consisting of 3,850,000 of underwriting discount, 8,800,000 of deferred underwriting discount, 7,748,431 of excess fair value of Founder Shares and 741,628 of actual offering costs. Of these amounts, 19,774,814 was recorded to additional paid-in capital and 1,365,245 costs related to the warrant liability was expensed immediately using the residual allocation method. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 317,074. Net income of 450,355 was adjusted by 435,437 of interest income on marketable securities held in trust and a 529,550 change in fair value of warrant liabilities. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 197,558 of cash for operating activities. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 664,645. Net income of 1,345,709 was adjusted by 2,204,264 of interest income on marketable securities held in trust, 4,692,176 of forgiveness of debt, 1,328,325 change in fair value of warrant liabilities, 125,000 of interest expense and 3,432,761 changes in operating assets and liabilities. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Trust account was fully liquidated. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 43,585. We intend to use the funds primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination. 

On July 1, 2023 the Company entered into a promissory note with the Buyers for up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 (the 2023 Promissory Note). The 2023 Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable upon the earlier of the date on which the Company consummates an initial business combination, the liquidation of the Company, or October 29, 2024. The Note does not bear any interest. On August 8, 2024, the Company amended the terms of the 2023 Promissory Note to increase the aggregate principal amount that may be borrowed to 2,000,000 and to extend the maturity to June 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had drawn 1,109,412 on the 2023 Promissory Note and had 890,588 available to be drawn. 

We expect that we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business prior to our initial business combination. We expect to incur significant costs related to identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year from the date that the condensed financial statements are issued. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we will repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account. 

On April 29, 2024, the shareholders approved the amendment of the Articles of Association Third Amendment ). As a result of the Third Amendment, the Company distributed all remaining sums in the trust account to shareholders and also permitted shareholders to retain 10 of their shares, after subtracting amounts for taxes and up to 100,000 for dissolution expenses. 

The Company assessed going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 205-40, Basis of Presentation Going Concern . Management has determined that the liquidity condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities, other than described below. 

We had an agreement to pay our sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, utilities and administrative support. We began incurring these fees on October 29, 2021 and incurred these fees monthly through June 28, 2023 when the agreement was terminated. 

The underwriters of the initial public offering were entitled to a deferred fee 8,800,000. The deferred fee would have become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we completed our initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. In June 2023, the underwriters agreed to waive its entitlement to the deferred underwriting commission of 8,800,000 to which it became entitled upon completion of the Company s Initial Public Offering, subject to the consummation of the Transaction. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the fair value of warrant liabilities, which requires a Black-Scholes model to fair value the warrants. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: 

Warrant Liabilities 

The Company accounts for the warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements from equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s own ordinary shares, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. 

For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the condensed statements of operations. See Note 9 for valuation methodology of warrants. 

30 

Class A Shares Subject to Possible Redemption 

The Company accounts for its ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC 480. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders deficit. The Company s ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at September 30, 2024, the Company had no ordinary shares subject to possible redemption. At December 31, 2023, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of the Company s condensed balance sheets. 

The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable ordinary shares are affected by charges against additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit. 

Net Income Per Ordinary Share 

The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share . Net income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. The Company has two classes of ordinary shares, which are referred to as Class A Shares and Class B Shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of ordinary shares. Accretion associated with the redeemable Class A Shares is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. The calculation of diluted income per share does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the (i) IPO and (ii) the private placement since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. The warrants are exercisable to purchase 22,250,000 Class A Shares in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have any dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ), which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. ASU 2020-06 removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception and it also simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity s effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as information related to income taxes paid to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This ASU will be effective for the annual period ending December 31, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and impacts of adoption of this ASU. 

The Company s management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. As a result, pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and our Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective, due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the Company s accounting for complex financial instruments and approval process of shareholder redemptions, including making greater use of third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding accounting applications. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our condensed financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the condensed financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the period presented. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, with the exception noted below. 

The co-principal executive officers and principal financial and accounting officer performed additional post-closing review procedures including reviewing historical filings and consulting with subject matter experts related to the accounting for complex financial instruments. While we have processes to properly identify and evaluate the appropriate accounting technical pronouncements and other literature for all significant or unusual transactions, we have improved, and will continue to improve, these processes to ensure that the nuances of such transactions are effectively evaluated in the context of the increasingly complex accounting standards.
