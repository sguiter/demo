 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements, and should be evaluated as such. Forward-looking statements include any statement or information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business plan and strategies, and our operational and financial outlook, estimates, projections, and guidance. These statements often include words such as anticipate, expect, plan, believe, intend, project, forecast, estimates, projections, should, might, may, will, ensure and other similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. Factors that might materially affect such forward-looking statements include: our ability to continue as a going concern; our ability to comply with the terms of our credit facilities or any credit facility into which we enter in the future; our ability to receive the remaining proceeds from the sale of our Medicare Advantage MA business in California in a timely manner; our ability to obtain any short or long-term debt or equity financing needed to operate our business; our ability to quickly and efficiently complete the wind down of our remaining Individual and Family Plan IFP businesses and MA businesses, including by satisfying liabilities of those businesses when due and payable; potential disruptions to our business due to corporate restructuring and any resulting headcount reduction; our ability to accurately estimate and effectively manage the costs relating to changes in our business offerings and models; a delay or inability to withdraw regulated capital from our subsidiaries; a lack of acceptance or slow adoption of our business model; our ability to retain existing consumers and expand consumer enrollment; our Care Partners abilities to obtain and accurately assess, code, and report risk adjustment factor scores; our ability to contract with care providers and arrange for the provision of quality care; our ability to obtain claims information timely and accurately; the impact of any pandemic or epidemic on our business and results of operations; the risks associated with our reliance on third-party providers to operate our business; the impact of modifications or changes to the U.S. health insurance markets; our ability to manage any growth of our business; our ability to operate, update or implement our technology platform and other information technology systems; our ability to retain key executives; our ability to successfully pursue acquisitions, integrate acquired businesses and divest businesses as needed; the occurrence of severe weather events, catastrophic health events, natural or man-made disasters, and social and political conditions or civil unrest; our ability to prevent and contain data security incidents and the impact of data security incidents on our members, patients, employees and financial results; our ability to comply with requirements to maintain effective internal controls; our ability to adapt to mitigate risks associated with our Accountable Care Organizations ACO Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health REACH businesses, including any unanticipated market or regulatory developments; and the other factors set forth under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, that was filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024 2023 Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. 
 
 The preceding list is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all of the factors that might affect our forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of future performance, taking into account the information currently available to us. These statements are only predictions based upon our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. 
 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances reflected in such forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur at all. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this release to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.

 market facing segments: NeueCare and NeueSolutions. NeueCare is our value-driven care delivery business that manages risk in partnership with external payors and serves all populations across The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ACA Marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid. NeueSolutions is our provider enablement business that includes a suite of technology, services, and clinical care solutions that empower providers to thrive in performance-based arrangements. 

Centrum Transaction: Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement dated October 29, 2024, among our wholly owned subsidiary Medical Practice Holding Company, LLC, RRD Healthcare, LLC RRD ), the Company, Centrum Medical Holdings, LLC Centrum and the other parties named therein, pursuant to which, we purchased RRD s equity in Centrum for total consideration of million, comprised of million in cash, a credit of million in previous distributions to RRD as the noncontrolling interest holder and a secured promissory note with a principal of million Centrum Promissory Note (such equity purchase and related transactions, the Centrum Transaction ). The Centrum Promissory Note is due on October 29, 2028 and bears a cash interest rate of per annum, payable monthly. Upon the close of the Centrum Transaction, NeueHealth fully owns Centrum. 
 
 In connection with the Centrum Transaction, the Company will make payment of million to the P Unit Holders of RRD (as define in Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies), generally payable by October 29, 2028, bearing cash interest at a rate of per annum. 
 
 Amended 2023 Credit Agreement and 2024 NEA Warrantholders Agreement: As described in further detail in Note 5 Borrowings and Common Stock Warrants Note 5 ), on April 8, 2024 we entered into an amendment increasing the amount available to borrow under the 2023 Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 5) by million . In conjunction with this amendment, we entered into the 2024 NEA Warrantholders Agreement (as defined in Note 5) s etting forth the rights and obligations of the NEA Lenders (as defined in Note 5) as holders of the warrants to acquire up to shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of per share, and providing for the issuance of warrants. Additionally, the 2023 Credit Agreement was amended on June 21, 2024, in conjunction with the execution of the Hercules Credit Agreement (defined below), to change the maturity date to be August 31, 2028. 
 
 Hercules Credit Agreement and Warrantholders Agreement: As described in further detail in Note 5, on June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the Hercules Credit Agreement ), among the Company, Hercules Capital, Inc. Hercules ), certain affiliates of Hercules (together with Hercules, the Lenders and other parties thereto to provide for a credit facility pursuant to which, among other things, Hercules has provided up to tranches of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of million, which mature on June 1, 2028. The Hercules Credit Agreement has

 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of per share. 
 
 Held-for-Sale Operations: During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we committed to a plan to sell AssociatesMD Medical Group, Inc. AMD ), which met the criteria to be classified as held for sale under ASC 360-10 Property, Plant, and Equipment . As a result, the major classes of assets and liabilities of AMD are now presented separately on the balance sheet within current assets of held-for-sale operations and current liabilities of held-for-sale operations. The results of AMD s operations remain included in continuing operations and are detailed in full at Note 15 Held-for-Sale Operations . 
 
 million subject to certain contingencies adjustments relating to Tangible Net Equity TNE . Upon completion of the sale, the Bright HealthCare reporting unit of our discontinued operations was no longer included in our operations. Refer to Note 16 Discontinued Operations for discussion of the transaction. 
 
 Debt Payoff: On December 27, 2023, we entered into an agreement regarding our revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Agent and a syndicate of banks (the 2021 Credit Agreement providing that, upon closing of the sale of our California Medicare Advantage business, and payments for debt and interest of million to the Agent and million to the issuers of letters of credit outstanding under the 2021 Credit Agreement, all liabilities of the Company under the 2021 Credit Agreement would be terminated (other than those under the outstanding letters of credit that remained outstanding thereafter) (collectively, the Termination ). These amounts were paid on January 2, 2024, and on that date the Termination occurred. 
 
 We evaluated this amendment to the 2021 Credit Agreement in accordance with ASC 470-60 Troubled Debt Restructuring and ASC 470-50 Debt - Modification and Extinguishments . The evaluation for troubled debt restructuring includes assessing both qualitative and quantitative factors such as whether the creditor granted a concession and if the Company is experiencing financial difficulties. Our quantitative analysis consisted of comparing the cash paid as part of the Payoff Condition to the total amount of outstanding indebtedness immediately prior to the payoff. Given the Company is experiencing financial difficulties, and the lenders granted a concession by accepting total payments of million for the remaining balance of the principal and interest due, we accounted for the transaction as a troubled debt restructuring and recognized a total gain of million from the debt settlement. 

million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company experienced negative operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Certain of the Company s insurance subsidiaries have material risk adjustment program obligations remaining related to the Company s discontinued commercial insurance business, totaling million , as noted further in Note 16. The subsidiaries entered into repayment agreements with the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS with respect to the unpaid obligations which are due March 15, 2025. 
 
 As described in Note 5, Borrowings and Common Stock Warrants , in April 2024 the Company entered into an amendment to our existing 2023 Credit Agreement, which allows the Company to borrow an additional million under the agreement.

 million available on this facility on October 1, 2024. In June 2024, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. for term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to million. We drew million of this facility in June 2024. Access to the remaining tranches of this facility is subject to several terms and conditions outside of management s control. 
 
 Cash and investment balances held at regulated insurance entities are subject to regulatory restrictions and can only be accessed through dividends declared to the non-regulated parent company or through reimbursements from administrative services agreements with the parent company. The regulated legal entities are required to hold certain minimum levels of risk-based capital and surplus to meet regulatory requirements. As noted further in Note 16, Discontinued Operations , we are out of compliance with the minimum levels for certain of our regulated insurance legal entities. In certain of our other regulated insurance legal entities, we hold surplus levels of risk-based capital, and as we complete the wind-down exercise related to these entities over the next , we expect to recapture through dividends and final liquidation actions the remaining cash positions of these entities. 
 
 We believe that the existing cash and investments will not be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months following the date the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are issued. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 In response to these conditions, management continues to implement plans to drive positive operating cash flow and achieve the requirements in the existing agreements to access additional liquidity. However, the Company may not fully collect the contingent consideration associated with the sale of the California Medicare Advantage business, may not be able to access other tranches of the new loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., and may not be able to recapture through dividends additional cash from its regulated insurance entities, as these matters are all subject to conditions that are not fully within the Company s control. In the event the Company is unable to access this additional liquidity or take other management actions, among other potential consequences, the Company forecasts that it will be unable to satisfy its obligations. As a result, the Company has concluded that management s plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was million of impairments to definite-lived intangible assets. There were impairments to definite-lived intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The current year impairment was a result of classifying AMD as held-for-sale, resulting in a write-down of the business carrying value to the fair value as approximated by the expected sale price. There were impairments to definite-lived intangible assets for the equivalent periods in 2023. 
 
 We are continuously evaluating whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that an intangible asset may not be recoverable including an adverse change in the extent in which an intangible asset is used, our market capitalization, macroeconomic trends, and other events and uncertainties. Negative trends in these factors could result in a non-cash charge for impairment to intangible assets in a future period. 
 
 Amortization expense relating to intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively, and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively.

 Profit sharing award: In June 2021, upon our acquisition of Centrum Medical Holdings, LLC. Centrum the noncontrolling interest holder granted profit-sharing awards to certain members of Centrum s management team. The outstanding awards are connected to the exercise of the 2026 Put/Call Events (as defined in the Centrum Purchase Agreement) and is contingent upon the achievement of the Centrum specific EBITDA calculation for the year ending December 31, 2025 surpassing a predetermined hurdle (the Performance Metric ). As the noncontrolling interest holder is considered to be an economic interest holder of NeueHealth, if the Performance Metric is achieved, the Company will incur compensation costs associated with the profit-sharing award that will have an offsetting impact in net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests on our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). As of September 30, 2024, no compensation cost has been recognized as we do not believe it is probable the Performance Metric will be achieved. This expectation is based on current performance projections; however, the actual compensation cost we will be required to recognize may vary depending on actual performance outcomes. 
 
 We will continue to monitor and assess the probability of the Performance Metric being achieved at each reporting period. Any future recognition of compensation cost will be disclosed in the financial statements as it becomes probable that the performance metric will be met. 
 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, in connection with the Centrum Transaction, we will pay million to the P Unit Holders payable by October 29, 2028, bearing cash interest at a rate of per annum. 
 
 Other commitments: As of September 30, 2024 , we had letters of credit unrelated to the 2021 Credit Agreement of million, as well as surety bonds of million. On our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, million of the cash and cash equivalents and million of the short-term investments is restricted as collateral to our undrawn letters of credit and surety bonds.

 operating segments within our continuing operations based on our primary product and service offerings: NeueCare and NeueSolutions. The NeueCare and NeueSolutions segments were new starting in the second quarter of 2023 and were formerly reported together within the aggregated Consumer Care segment. The updates to our reportable segments conform with the Company s CODM s view of our ongoing operations. 
 
 NeueCare and NeueSolutions, which make up o ur value-driven Consumer Care business that manages risk in partnership with external payors, aim to significantly reduce the friction and current lack of coordination between payors by delivering on our Fully Aligned Care Model with multiple payors. The following is a description of the types of products and services from which the reportable segments of our continuing operations derive their revenues: 
 
 NeueCare: Provides care services in our clinics with wrap around care management and care coordination activities for those members where we take full or partial risk. As of September 30, 2024, NeueCare provides virtual and in-person clinical care through its owned primary care clinics within an integrated care delivery system. Through these risk-bearing clinics and our affiliated network of care providers, our NeueCare segment serves approximately consumers. NeueCare customers include external payors, third party administrators, affiliated providers and direct-to-government programs. 
 
 NeueSolutions: Our provider enablement business that facilitates care coordination activities through the use of population health tools including technology, data analytics, care and utilization management, and clinical solutions and care teams to support patients.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, income tax was an expense of million and a benefit of million, respectively. The impact from income taxes varies from the federal statutory rate of 21.0 due to state income taxes, changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and adjustments for permanent differences. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the expense largely relates to estimated state income taxes attributable to income earned in separate filing states without state net operating loss carryforwards and in combined filing states that restrict which entities within the group may use specific net operating loss carryforwards. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the benefit largely relates to the removal of the accrued amortization of originating goodwill from asset acquisitions due to goodwill impairment and estimated state income taxes attributable to income earned in separate filing states without state net operating loss carryforwards.

 REACH ACOs participating through the global risk arrangement and assuming full risk for the total cost of care of aligned beneficiaries. As part of our participation in the ACO REACH Model, we are guaranteeing the performance of our care network of participating and preferred providers. The intention of the ACO REACH Model is to enhance the quality of care for Medicare FFS beneficiaries while reducing the administrative burden, supporting a focus on complex, chronically ill patients, and encouraging physician organizations that have not typically participated in Medicare FFS programs to serve Medicare FFS beneficiaries. 
 
 Key components of the financial agreement for the ACO REACH Model include: 
 
 Performance Year Benchmark: The target amount for Medicare expenditures on covered services (Medicare Part A and B) furnished to a REACH ACO s aligned beneficiaries during a performance year. The Performance Year Benchmark will be compared to the REACH ACO s performance year expenditures. This comparison will be used to calculate shared savings and shared losses. The Performance Year Benchmark is established at the beginning of the performance year utilizing prospective trend estimates and is subject to retrospective trend adjustments, if warranted, before the Financial Reconciliation. 
 Risk-Sharing Arrangements: Used in determining the percent of savings and losses that REACH ACOs are eligible to receive as shared savings or may be required to repay as shared losses. 
 Financial Reconciliation: The process by which CMS determines shared savings or shared losses by comparing the calculated total benchmark expenditures for a given REACH ACO s aligned population to the actual expenditures of 
 27

 of our REACH ACOs elected to participate in a stop-loss arrangement offered by CMS, while REACH ACO elected third-party coverage. The stop-loss arrangement and third-party coverage are designed to reduce the financial uncertainty associated with high-cost expenditures of individual beneficiaries. Additionally, CMS has created a mandatory risk corridor program that allocates the REACH ACO s shared savings and losses in bands of percentage thresholds, after a deviation of greater than of the Performance Year Benchmark. 
 
 Performance Guarantees 
 
 Through our participation in the ACO REACH Model, we determined that our arrangements with the providers of our REACH ACO beneficiaries require us to guarantee their performance to CMS. At the beginning of the performance year, we recognized the ACO REACH estimated performance year obligation and receivable for the duration of the performance year. This receivable and obligation are measured at an amount equivalent to the estimated Performance Year Benchmark per CMS that is representative of the expected Medicare expenditures for beneficiaries aligned to our REACH ACOs. As we fulfill our obligation, we amortize the guarantee on a straight-line basis for the amount that represents the completed portion of the performance obligation. The receivable is reduced as we receive payments from CMS for in-network claims or receive CMS reporting detailing out-of-network claims paid by CMS on behalf of our aligned beneficiaries. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate both in-network claims and out-of-network claims incurred by beneficiaries aligned to our REACH ACOs but not yet reported and record a reserve for the estimated amount which is included in medical costs payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For each performance year, the final consideration due to the REACH ACOs by CMS (shared savings) or the consideration due to CMS by the REACH ACOs (shared loss) is reconciled in the year following the performance year. On a periodic basis CMS adjusts the estimated Performance Year Benchmark based upon revised trend assumptions and changes in attributed membership. CMS will also estimate the shared savings or loss for the REACH ACO on a quarterly basis based upon the estimated Performance Year Benchmark, changes to membership, payments made to the REACH ACO for in-network claims, out-of-network claims paid on behalf of the REACH ACO and various other assumptions including incurred but not reported reserves. The estimated Performance Year Benchmark is our best estimate of our obligation as we are unable to estimate the potential shared savings or loss due to the stop-loss arrangement , risk corridor components of the agreement, and a number of variables including but not limited to risk ratings and benchmark trends that could have an inestimable impact on estimated future payments. 
 
 ACO REACH performance year obligation 
 
 (1) As of September 30, 2024, we estimate there to be in-network and out-of-network claims incurred by beneficiaries aligned to our REACH ACOs but not reported of million related to performance year 2024; this is included in medical costs payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Under ASC 810, Consolidatio n , this loss of control would likely trigger a gain or loss for the parent as the parent would remeasure its retained noncontrolling investment at fair value. Upon deconsolidation, the Company valued its investment in BHIC-Texas to be million , which is equivalent to the Deconsolidated Entity's carrying value. Upon valuing the investment in BHIC-Texas we assessed the current expected credit loss associated with the underlying receivables; as a result of our analysis we recorded a full valuation allowance on the investment due to uncertainties related to the collection of the risk share receivable.

 In October 2022, we announced that we will no longer offer commercial plans through our Bright HealthCare - Commercial segment in 2023. As a result, we exited the Commercial marketplace effective December 31, 2022. We determined this exit represented a strategic shift that will have a material impact on our business and financial results that requires presentation as discontinued operations. 
 
 While we are no longer offering plans in the Commercial marketplace as of December 31, 2022, we will continue to be involved in the states where we formerly operated in, as we support run out activities of medical claims incurred in the 2022 plan year and perform other activities necessary to wind down our operations in each state. We are substantially complete with medical claim payments as of the end of 2023, and we will continue to make remaining medical claim payments and payments towards the remaining risk adjustment obligations through 2024 and into 2025.

 Revenue Recognition: We record adjustments for changes to the risk adjustment balances for individual policies in premium revenue. The risk adjustment program adjusts premiums based on the demographic factors and health status of each consumer as derived from current-year medical diagnoses as reported throughout the year. Under the risk adjustment program, a risk score is assigned to each covered consumer to determine an average risk score at the individual and small-group level by legal entity in a particular market in a state. Additionally, an average risk score is determined for the entire subject population for each market in each state. Settlements are determined on a net basis by legal entity and state and are made in the middle of the year following the end of the contract year. Each health insurance issuer s average risk score is compared to the state s average risk score. Risk adjustment is subject to audit by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services HHS ), which could result in future payments applicable to benefit years.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes as well as the Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Form 10-K. Unless the context otherwise indicates or requires, the terms we , our , and the Company as used herein refer to NeueHealth, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Business Overview 
 
 NeueHealth, Inc. was founded in 2015 to transform healthcare. Although the business has evolved, our commitment to making high-quality, coordinated healthcare accessible and affordable to all populations remains unchanged. NeueHealth consists of two reportable segments within our continuing operations: NeueCare and NeueSolutions. Additionally, we have one reportable segment in our discontinued operations: Bright HealthCare - Commercial. 
 
 NeueCare. Our value-driven care delivery business that manages risk in partnership with external payors and serves all populations across the ACA Marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid. NeueCare aims to significantly reduce the friction and current lack of coordination between payors and providers to enable a truly consumer-centric healthcare experience. As of September 30, 2024, NeueCare delivers high-quality in-person and virtual clinical care through its 74 owned primary care clinics within an integrated care delivery system. Through these risk-bearing clinics and our affiliated network of care providers, NeueCare maintained approximately 404,000 consumers, inclusive of 347,000 value-based consumers and 57,000 fee-for-service consumers. 
 
 NeueSolutions. Our provider enablement business that includes a suite of technology, services, and clinical care solutions that empower providers to thrive in performance-based arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, NeueSolutions had approximately 43,000 value-based care consumers attributed to its REACH ACOs and 119,000 enablement services lives. 
 
 Bright HealthCare - Commercial. Included in our discontinued operations, our Commercial healthcare financing and distribution business focused on commercial plans. In October 2022, we announced that we would no longer offer commercial health plans effective at the end of 2022. 

Business Update 
 
 NeueHealth delivered its strongest financial performance to date in the third quarter, driving Adjusted EBITDA profitability for the third consecutive quarter. Both our NeueCare and NeueSolutions business segments continued delivering value for consumers, providers, and payors across the healthcare industry driving our Adjusted EBITDA profitability in the Third Quarter. Looking ahead, we believe our strong performance through the third quarter provides a solid foundation to continue to advance our value-driven, consumer-centric care model, positioning NeueHealth for continued success and growth in 2025. 
 
 Growth areas we are focusing on in the future include continuing to diversify and grow our consumer base across all product categories, including the ACA Marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid, driving capital-efficient growth in existing and new markets by leveraging the strong relationships we have formed with our payor partners, and growing our relationships with a diverse set of providers, no matter where they are on their path to participating in performance-based arrangements. 
 
 On October 30, we announced that we acquired full ownership of Centrum Health, one of our value-driven clinic brands. This simplifies our corporate structure, streamlining operations to support our ongoing focus on advancing our value-driven, consumer-centric care model. We are pleased to announce this transaction as it further supports our belief in our Centrum Health clinics and their ability to create a more coordinated, seamless healthcare experience for all consumers. 
 
 Overall, we believe we are well-positioned to finish 2024 on a strong note, and we are focused on continuing the positive momentum we have generated through the end of the year and beyond. We believe we have established a solid foundation to

 continue to advance our model, grow the consumers we serve, and deepen our relationships with payor and provider partners as we make high-quality healthcare accessible and affordable for all. 

Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to our GAAP financial information, we use several operating and financial metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate our business plan and make strategic decisions. The following table includes two key metrics used to measure our performance: approximate consumers and patients served as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 2023 Value-Based Consumers served 390,000 355,000 Enablement Services Lives 119,000 31,000 
 
 Value-Based Care Consumers 
 
 Value-based care consumers are consumers attributed to providers contracted under various value-based care delivery models in which the responsibility for control of an attributed patient s medical care is transferred, in part or wholly, to our NeueHealth owned or affiliated medical groups. We believe growth in the number of value-based care consumers is a key indicator of the performance of our NeueHealth business. It also informs our management of the operational, clinical, technological and administrative functional area needs that will require further investment to support expected future patient growth and effective medical management practices. We saw a year over year increase in value-based care consumers of approximately 35,000 consumers; driven by an increase of 55,000 value-based care consumers through our third-party payor relationships, partially offset by a decline of approximately 20,000 ACO REACH lives. Our focus is to continue to grow the number of value-based care consumers through third-party payor relationships. 
 
 Enablement Services Lives 
 
 Enablement services lives are members attributed to NeueHealth by provider partner groups that are outside of the NeueHealth owned network. We bring the people, process, and technology platforms necessary to manage the administrative support for these value-based and risk arrangement members, on behalf of our provider partners. As a result of the value we drive, we ended the quarter with approximately 119,000 enablement services lives under contract within those organizations.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net Loss excluding loss from discontinued operations, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, transaction costs, share-based and other long-term compensation expense, gains on troubled debt restructuring, changes in the fair value of equity securities and derivatives, restructuring and contract termination costs, held-

 for-sale operations, losses related to the bankruptcy of contractual counterparties, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, and the tax effect of all such items. Adjusted EBITDA has been presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP, because we believe it assists management and investors in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to establish discretionary annual incentive compensation and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of financial performance or cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, this measure is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management s discretionary use as we do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. The presentation of this measure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentation of this measure may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company.

 (a) Transaction costs include accounting, tax, valuation, consulting, legal and investment banking fees directly relating to financing initiatives and acquisitions or dispositions. These costs can vary from period to period and impact comparability, and we do not believe such transaction costs reflect the ongoing performance of our business.

 awards. Also includes estimated compensation expense that the Company has the option to pay in cash or shares of 3.0 million and 5.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which is a 2024-only deviation from the long-term incentive award plan. 
 (c) Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of gains on troubled debt restructuring. The comparable periods in 2023 have been recast to exclude these impacts. 
 (d) Represents the non-cash change in the fair value of the warrant liability established for warrants included in our financing arrangements, which are remeasured at fair value each reporting period. 
 (e) Restructuring and contract termination costs represent severance costs as part of a workforce reduction, amounts paid for early termination of leases, and impairment of certain long-lived assets primarily relating to our decision to exit the Commercial business for the 2023 plan year. 
 (f) Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of our operations classified as held-for-sale. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no intangible asset impairment expense and 11.4 million of intangible asset impairment expense was incurred, respectively, as a result of classifying operations as held-for-sale. The comparable periods in 2023 have been recast to exclude these impacts. 
 (g) Represents the costs expected to be incurred as a result of one of our ACO REACH care partners filing for bankruptcy; includes the full allowance established for the outstanding receivable and ongoing costs incurred to manage and provide service to members attributed to the care partner that would have otherwise been reimbursed prior to the care partner s bankruptcy.

 Total revenues decreased by 36.5 million, or 13.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 163.9 million or 18.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. These decreases were primarily driven by a decrease of approximately 20,000 beneficiaries aligned to our REACH ACOs resulting in decreased ACO REACH revenue of 50.6 million and 205.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. These decreases were offset by increases in our capitated revenue of 11.0 million and 37.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in capitated revenue is a result of increased membership through our third-party payor contracts as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Medical costs decreased by 43.7 million , or 19.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Medical costs decreased by 174.5 million or 23.8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in medical costs was primarily driven by a decrease in beneficiaries aligned to our REACH ACOs. 
 
 Operating costs decreased by 8.5 million , or 11.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Operating costs decreased by 20.6 million, or 9.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in operating costs was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees incurred in the 2024 periods as compared to the 2023 periods; specifically, in 2023 we incurred transaction costs as we worked towards the sale of the California Medicare Advantage business while in 2024 there was no equivalent activity. 
 
 Our operating cost ratio of 27.5 and 28.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 60 and 310 basis points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase is driven by the decrease in revenue due to a decline in our ACO REACH aligned beneficiaries outweighing the decreases in our operating costs that have continued to decrease as part of our restructuring efforts. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized 11.4 million in impairments of intangible assets as a result of classifying AMD as held-for-sale. In our held-for-sale analysis we concluded the carrying value of the AMD disposal group exceeded its estimated fair value set equivalent to an expected sale price; as such we fully impaired all long-lived assets. We recognized no impairments of intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024. There was no equivalent activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased by 0.6 million and 2.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, respectively. The decrease is primarily driven by a corresponding decrease in property and equipment assets as well as intangible assets. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 4.6 million and 14.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to the payoff of the 2021 Credit Agreement in January 2024. 
 
 We recognized warrant expense of 0.5 million and warrant income of 3.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a warrant expense of 9.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. This is a result of the 2023 Warrantholders Agreement executed in conjunction with the 2023 Credit Agreement. In the third quarter of 2023 we recognized the expense for the warrants available to be issued under the 2023 Warrantholders Agreement executed in conjunction with the 2023 Credit Agreement. In 2024, we continued to fair value the warrants available to be issued under the 2023 Warrantholders Agreement as well as the warrantholders agreements executed in conjunction with the Commitment Increase of the Amended 2023 Credit Agreement and the Hercules Credit Agreement in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Income tax was an expense of 2.8 million and a benefit of 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income tax was an expense of 3.3 million and a benefit of 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The impact from income taxes varies from the federal statutory rate of 21 due to state income taxes, changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and adjustments for permanent differences. For

 the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the expense largely relates to estimated state income taxes attributable to income earned in separate filing states without state net operating loss carryforwards and in combined filing states that restrict which entities within the group may use specific net operating loss carryforwards. 
 
 Loss from discontinued operations decreased by 53.5 million and 197.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease is primarily driven by the sale of the California Medicare Advantage business that occurred in January 2024, significantly decreasing our total discontinued operations. Additionally, the decrease is attributable to being more than a year into the runout of our Commercial business as of September 30, 2024 compared to only nine months into runout as of September 30, 2023.

 NeueCare s capitated revenue increased by 11.0 million or 18.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. NeueCare s capitated revenue increased by 37.1 million , or 23.2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was a result of increased membership through our third-party payor contracts as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 NeueCare s service revenue increased 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in NeueCare s service revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in fee-for-service contracts in the current period for our Centrum subsidiary where these contracts were negligible for Centrum in 2023. NeueCare s service revenue decreased 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in NeueCare s service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a change in our estimated implicit price concessions for our fee-for-service contracts to reflect more current collection trends. 
 
 NeueCare s investment income increased by 0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The investment income in the current year is attributable to a financial guarantee with a third-party payor invested in a certificate of deposit; there were no equivalent investments in the same periods in 2023.

 Affiliated revenue increased by 4.5 million and 2.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023 due to fluctuations in ACO surplus at our owned providers. 
 
 NeueCare s medical costs increased by 10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. NeueCare s medical costs increased by 28.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily a result of increases in our value-based care lives through third-party payor contracts including increases of 2.6 million and 7.8 million in provider capitation paid to our affiliate partners for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Operating costs for the NeueCare segment increased 0.5 million and 7.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily driven by higher payroll expense to support the increase in value-based care lives attributed to third-party payor contracts. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized 11.4 million in impairments of intangible assets as a result of classifying AMD as held-for-sale. In our held-for-sale analysis we concluded the carrying value of the AMD disposal group exceeded its estimated fair value set equivalent to an expected sale price; as such we fully impaired all long-lived assets. We recognized no impairments of intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024. There was no equivalent activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 NeueCare s depreciation and amortization remained relatively flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The 0.4 million decrease over the three-month period is a result of a decrease in intangible asset amortization expense recognized in the third quarter of 2024 due to the AMD intangibles impairment in the second quarter of 2024. The 0.3 million increase for the nine-month period is primarily due to the decrease in the estimated useful lives for certain fixed assets at our clinic locations. NeueCare s operating income is inclusive of AMD s net loss of 2.4 million and 20.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

 NeueSolutions s ACO REACH revenue decreased 50.6 million , or 25.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. NeueSolutions s ACO REACH revenue decreased 205.8 million or 30.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is attributable to a decrease of approximately 20,000 beneficiaries aligned to our REACH ACOs as of September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. See Note 13, ACO REACH , for additional information regarding our remaining performance obligation based on the most recent benchmark data.

 NeueSolutions s service revenue increased 1.8 million and 5.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in service revenue was driven by revenue from our enablement services contracts. 
 
 NeueSolutions s medical costs decreased by 50.2 million and 200.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. This decrease is attributable to a decrease of approximately 20,000 beneficiaries aligned to our REACH ACOs as of September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 NeueSolutions s operating costs increased by 0.3 million and 3.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. These increases were driven by the additional compensation and technology expenses supporting the growing business and increased membership. 
 
 NeueSolutions s bad debt expense decreased by 22.4 million f or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in bad debt expense was primarily driven by one of our ACO REACH care partners filing for bankruptcy in the third quarter of 2023 and a full allowance being established on the corresponding receivables with no equivalent activity in the same periods of 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet current and future needs. Our expected primary uses on a short-term and long-term basis are for geographic and service offering expansion, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. We have historically funded our operations and acquisitions primarily through the sale of preferred stock and sales of our common stock. 
 
 We believe that the existing cash and investments will not be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months following the date the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are issued. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In response to these conditions, management continues to implement plans to drive positive operating cash flow and achieve the conditions in the existing agreements to access additional liquidity. However, the Company may not fully collect the contingent consideration associated with the sale of the California Medicare Advantage business, may not be able to access other tranches of the new loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., and may not be able to recapture through dividends additional cash from its regulated insurance entities, as these matters are all subject to conditions that are not fully within the Company s control. In the event the Company is unable to access this additional liquidity or take other management actions, among other potential consequences, the Company forecasts that it will be unable to satisfy its obligations. As a result, the Company has concluded that management s plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 In addition to our current capital needs, we regularly evaluate our future capital needs to support our future growth plans and other strategic opportunities that may arise. We may seek funds through borrowings or through additional rounds of financing, including private or public equity offerings. Our longer-term future capital requirements and ability to raise additional capital will depend on many forward-looking factors, including: 
 
 investor confidence in our ability to continue as a going concern, 
 our ability to continue executing on cost saving measures previously described, and 
 our ability to successfully improve our profitability. 
 
 Our expected primary short-term uses of cash include the purchase of the remaining equity interest of Centrum Medical Holdings, LLC Centrum ), risk adjustment payable principal and interest and ongoing run out disbursements for medical claims and provider settlements related to our regulated insurance entities, the ACO REACH performance year obligation, and other general and administrative costs. Our long-term cash requirements primarily include operating lease obligations, redeemable noncontrolling interest and ongoing general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Cash and investment balances held at regulated insurance entities are subject to regulatory restrictions and can only be accessed through dividends declared to the non-regulated parent company, pending regulatory approval, or through reimbursements

 related to administrative services agreements with the parent company. The Company declared 28.2 million of dividends from the regulated insurance entities to the parent company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and no dividends from the regulated insurance entities to the parent company for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The regulated legal entities are required to hold certain minimum levels of risk-based capital and surplus to satisfy regulatory requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we were out of compliance with the minimum levels for certain of our regulated insurance legal entities within our Bright HealthCare-Commercial segment. 

Indebtedness 
 
 In March 2021, we entered into a 350.0 million revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Agent and a syndicate of banks (the 2021 Credit Agreement ), which was set to mature on February 28, 2024. On January 2, 2024, the Termination (as defined below) occurred and, as of that date we had no outstanding borrowings on the Credit Agreement. 
 
 On December 27, 2023, we entered into an agreement regarding our 2021 Credit Agreement with the Agent providing that upon closing of the sale of our California Medicare Advantage business, and payments of 274.6 million to the Agent and 24.1 million to the issuers of letters of credit outstanding under the 2021 Credit Agreement, all liabilities of the Company under the 2021 Credit Agreement would be terminated (other than those under the outstanding letters of credit that remained outstanding thereafter) (collectively, the Termination ). These amounts were paid on January 2, 2024, and on that date the Termination occurred, and we had no outstanding borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement. 
 
 On August 4, 2023, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (as amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the 2023 Credit Agreement ), among the Company, NEA and the lenders from time to time party thereto (together with NEA and each of their respective successors and assigns, the Lenders to provide for a credit facility pursuant to which, among other things, the lenders have provided 60.0 million delayed draw term loan commitments. The Company may borrow delayed draw term loans under such commitments at any time and from time to time on or prior to the date that is nine months after the effective date of the 2023 Credit Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions. Borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement accrue interest at a rate per annum of 15.00 , payable quarterly in arrears at the Company s election, subject to limitations set forth in the Fourth Waiver (as defined below) in respect of cash payments under the 2023 Credit Agreement, either in cash or in kind by adding the amount of accrued interest to the principal amount of the outstanding loans under the 2023 Credit Agreement. The 2023 Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to make certain restricted payments, incur additional debt, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change its business or make investments. 
 
 In connection with the 2023 Credit Agreement, on August 4, 2023, the Company and the Lenders entered into a warrantholders agreement setting forth the rights and obligations of the Company and the Lenders as holders (in such capacity, the Holders of the warrants to acquire shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of 0.01 per share (the Warrants ), and providing for the issuance of the Warrants to purchase up to 1,656,789 shares of Common Stock.

 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the periods shown: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (98,823) (2,395,319) Net cash provided by investing activities 189,230 1,145,441 Net cash (used in)/provided by financing activities (239,274) 41,005 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (148,867) (1,208,873) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 375,280 1,932,290 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 226,413 723,417 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities decreased by 2.3 billion compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, primarily a result of being further into the run out of our Commercial operations at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. More specifically, in the third quarter of 2023, we settled a substantial portion of our risk adjustment payable related to our BHC-Commercial business while we continued to make payments towards our CMS Repayment Agreement; they are presently in a much lesser value than the payment that occurred in 2023. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities decreased by 956.2 million compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 we sold a significant majority of our investment holdings to cover remaining liabilities of our run out operations for the Commercial business including our risk adjustment payable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not have equivalent investment activity as the majority of our investment portfolio was liquidated in 2023. The cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to the net proceeds received for the sale of our California Medicare Advantage business that closed effective January 1, 2024; there was not equivalent activity during the prior year. The liquidated investment portfolios in 2023 were more substantial than the net proceeds received for the sale of our California Medicare Advantage business in 2024. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities increased by 280.3 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This fluctuation is a result of the payoff of our short-term debt using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our California Medicare Advantage business during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net proceeds from long term borrowings of 42.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net proceeds from borrowings on the 2023 Credit Agreement of 50.0 million; there were no equivalent debt payoff activities during this period.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024 , our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. In light of this fact, our management has performed additional analyses, reconciliations, and other post-closing procedures and has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. 
 
 Previously Reported Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 As disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K, in 2022 we identified a material weakness related to the control activities component of internal control over financial reporting, based upon the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO framework ). Specifically, multiple deficiencies constituted a material weakness, in the aggregate, relating to deployment of control activities through internal control policies that establish what is expected and procedures that put policies into action. This material weakness remained as of December 31, 2023, as we were unable to conclude control activities consistently had sufficient time to demonstrate operational effectiveness. 
 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company continues to take action to support its ongoing efforts to remediate the material weakness. This includes working with control owners to refine control procedures to improve the design, consistency, timeliness and sufficiency of documentation supporting the performance and review of controls and/or significant or material transactions. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than the material weakness remediation actions discussed above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management continues to advance its remediation program to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated.
