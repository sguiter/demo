Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ from our beliefs, expectations, estimates and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements are not historical in nature and can be identified by words such as anticipate, estimate, will, should, expect, target, believe, outlook, potential, continue, intend, seek, plan, goals, future, likely, may and similar expressions or their negative forms, or by references to strategy, plans or intentions. By their nature, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, are not statements of historical facts or guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions or changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Our expectations, beliefs and estimates are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs and estimates will prove to be correct or be achieved and actual results may vary materially from what is expressed in or indicated by the forward-looking statements. 
 These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under the caption Risk Factors .

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Important factors that may affect our actual results include, among others: 
 the general political, economic and competitive conditions in the markets in which we invest and their impact on our investment portfolio, financial condition and business operations; 
 inflationary trends which have led to higher interest rates and increased market volatility 
 reduced demand for office, multifamily or retail space, including as a result of increased hybrid work schedules which allow work from remote locations other than the employer's office premises 
 defaults by borrowers in paying debt service on outstanding indebtedness and borrowers' abilities to manage and stabilize properties; 
 our ability to obtain or maintain financing arrangements on terms favorable to us or at all; 
 the level and volatility of prevailing interest rates and credit spreads; 
 reductions in the yield on our investments and increases in the cost of our financing; 
 general volatility of the securities markets in which we participate and the potential need to post additional collateral on our financing arrangements; 
 the return or impact of current or future investments; 
 changes in our business, investment strategies or target investments; 
 increased competition from entities investing in our target investments; 
 effects of hedging instruments on our target investments; 
 changes in governmental regulations, tax law and rates and similar matters;

The increase in the allowance was primarily related to specific reserves on loans that were assessed individually as of September 30, 2024, partially offset by a reduction in the general reserve due to loan repayments and credit migration within the loan portfolio.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company resolved a million senior loan secured by a multifamily property located in Chicago, IL. The loan had been considered collateral-dependent and had previously been placed on nonaccrual status. In connection with the resolution, the Company incurred a write-off of ) million. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company modified a million senior loan secured by a mixed-use multifamily, event space and office property located in Pittsburgh, PA.

See below for further details. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recovered million of amounts previously written off related to a held-for-investment legacy loan that was secured by an office property in San Diego, CA. The recovery was associated with a cooperation agreement between the Company and the prior sponsor, and related to the settlement of an arbitration process between that sponsor and an unaffiliated party. The Company had recognized a write-off of ) million at the time of the resolution of the legacy nonaccrual loan during the year ended December 31, 2023. The recovery of million was recognized in the provision for credit losses on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of income during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had collateral-dependent loans with an aggregate principal balance of million, for which the Company recorded an allowance for credit losses of million. These loans were individually assessed in accordance with the CECL framework and the allowance for credit losses was determined based on the estimates of the collateral properties fair value. The performance of the collateral properties securing these loans, which include office buildings, mixed-use properties with an office component, and hotel assets, has been impacted by an uncertain commercial real estate market and macroeconomic outlook, which includes weakening in credit fundamentals, capital markets volatility and significantly reduced real estate transaction activity, especially for certain property types, such as office assets located in underperforming markets with reduced tenant demand, and a meaningfully higher cost of capital driven by high interest rates. These macroeconomic and market factors have resulted in the slowing of business plan execution and reduced market liquidity, thereby impacting the borrowers ability to either sell or refinance their properties to repay the Company s loans. See Note 9 - Fair Value, for further detail on the fair value measurement of these loans.

 As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average risk rating of the Company s loan portfolio was , versus as of December 31, 2023, weighted by unpaid principal balance. The change in portfolio risk rating as of September 30, 2024, versus December 31, 2023, is mainly a result of select loan risk rating downgrades, partially offset by certain rating upgrades and resolutions of several previously risk-rated 5 loans. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, as part of its quarterly risk rating process, the Company downgraded to a risk rating of 5 senior loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million and secured by an office property and a hotel property. These loans were downgraded due to the borrowers unwillingness to make further capital commitments to support the collateral properties resulting from a variety of factors including the challenging office leasing environment, local market fundamentals, uncertain and volatile capital market conditions resulting in limited liquidity for real estate transactions, further pressure on property values and other factors related to property specific operating performance. These loans are considered collateral dependent and have been placed on nonaccrual status as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company resolved loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of million that had a risk rating of 5 . In connection with these resolutions, the company incurred write-offs totaling ) million, as described above.

 of its loans held-for-investment with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million to be collateral-dependent in accordance with its policy. Therefore, the allowance for credit losses associated with these loans was based on the estimates of the fair value of the loans underlying property collateral, less costs to sell, if applicable, and the loans are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs and are classified as Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024, loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million were valued using the discounted cash flow method. The significant unobservable inputs used to estimate the fair value on these loans include the exit capitalization rate and discount rate, which ranged from to , and from to , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million were valued using the estimated proceeds from the sale of the loan or collateral property, less the estimated costs to sell. Refer to Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Loans Held-for-Investment, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses for further detail. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company acquired legal title of an office property in Maynard, MA. The Company s fair market value estimate at the time of conversion from loan held-for-investment to REO was million and was determined primarily using the discounted cash flow method. The significant unobservable inputs used to estimate the fair value include the exit capitalization rate and discount rate, which ranged from to , and from to , respectively. Refer to Note 4 - Real Estate Owned, Net for further detail. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 In accordance with ASC 820, the Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, for which fair value can be estimated. 
 The following describes the Company s methods for estimating the fair value for financial instruments: 
 Loans held-for-investment are carried at cost, net of any unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees, origination costs and allowance for credit losses, as applicable. The Company estimates the fair value of its loans held-for-investment by assessing any changes in market interest rates, credit spreads for loans of comparable risk as corroborated by inquiry of other market participants, shifts in credit profiles and actual operating results, taking into consideration such factors as underlying property type, property competitive position within its market, market and submarket fundamentals, tenant mix, nature of business plan, sponsorship, extent of leverage and other loan terms. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these assets as Level 3. 
 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash have a carrying value which approximates fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these assets as Level 1. 
 The carrying value of underlying loans in repurchase and secured credit facilities that mature in less than one year generally approximates fair value due to the short maturities. The Company s long-term repurchase and secured credit facilities have, and the Company s asset-specific facility had, floating rates based on an index plus a credit spread and the credit spread is typically consistent with those demanded in the market. Accordingly, the interest rates on these borrowings are at market and, thus, carrying value approximates fair value. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these liabilities as Level 2. 
 Securitized debt obligations are recorded at outstanding principal, net of any unamortized deferred debt issuance costs. In determining the fair value of its securitized debt obligations, management s judgment may be used to arrive at fair value that considers prices obtained from third-party pricing providers, broker quotes received and other applicable market data. If observable market prices are not available or insufficient to determine fair value due principally to illiquidity in the marketplace, then fair value is based upon internally developed models that are primarily based on observable market-based inputs but also include unobservable market data inputs (including prepayment speeds, delinquency levels and credit losses). The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these liabilities as Level 2.

 million and million, respectively, on loans held-for-investment, which it expects to fund, subject to the satisfaction of any conditions precedent to such commitments, over the tenure of these loans. These commitments generally provide funding for lease-related or capital improvement expenditures, as well as interest and carry costs, all of which will vary depending on the progress of capital improvement projects, leasing and cash flows at the properties that serve as collateral for the Company s loans. Therefore, the exact timing and amounts of such loan balance future fundings are generally uncertain and will depend on the current and future performance of the collateral properties. The Company typically finances the funding of its loan commitments on terms generally consistent with its overall financing facilities; however, most of its financing facility counterparties are not obligated to fund their ratable portion of these loan commitments over time and have varying degrees of discretion over future loan funding obligations, including the advance rates on their fundings. The Company may be obligated to fund loan commitments with respect to a financed asset even if the applicable financing counterparty will not fund their ratable portion of the loan commitment and/or has made margin calls with respect to such financed asset. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million in other liabilities related to the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments. See Note 3 - Loans Held-for-Investment, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses, for further detail.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Our Company 
 Granite Point Mortgage Trust Inc. is an internally-managed real estate finance company that focuses primarily on directly originating, investing in and managing senior floating-rate commercial mortgage loans and other debt and debt-like commercial real estate investments, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol GPMT . Our investment objective is to preserve our stockholders capital while generating attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term, primarily through dividends derived from current income produced by our investment portfolio. We operate as a REIT, as defined under the Code. We also operate our business in a manner intended to maintain our exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act. We operate our business as one segment. 
 Recent Developments 
 Macroeconomic Environment 
 The period over the last several quarters has been characterized by continued volatility in the global securities markets, driven by investor concerns over inflation, high interest rates, escalating trade tensions, slowing economic growth, political and regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical conditions. Events affecting financial institutions during the first half of 2024 have also contributed to volatility in global markets and diminished liquidity and credit availability. 
 Interest rates remain at an elevated level and the timing, direction and extent of any future interest rate changes remain uncertain. Although our business model is such that higher interest rates should, all else being equal, generally correlate to higher net income, interest rates having remained elevated for an extended period of time have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our existing borrowers and the cost of financing their properties and lead to non-performance. Additionally, higher interest rates and increasing costs may dampen consumer spending and slow corporate profit growth, which may negatively impact the collateral underlying certain of our loans. Higher interest rates have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, commercial real estate property values. It remains difficult to predict the full impact on macroeconomic conditions and our business of recent events and any future changes in interest rates or inflation. 
 Office Property Market 
 The office property market has been experiencing higher vacancies, slower leasing activity and various tenants re-evaluating their need for space due in large part to remote and hybrid work arrangements. These factors coupled with inflation, high interest rates and limited market liquidity have created a high level of uncertainty with respect to property values. These dynamics have stressed certain borrowers ability and willingness to support their properties and perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. Given this uncertainty, it remains difficult to predict the effect these challenging conditions may have on the office property market, our borrowers, their performance under the terms of our loans secured by office properties and our financial results.

 Key Financial Measures and Indicators 
 As a commercial real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are earnings per share presented on a GAAP basis, dividends declared on common stock, Distributable Earnings and book value per share of common stock. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a GAAP net (loss) per basic share of (0.69), declared a cash dividend of 0.05 per share of common stock and reported Distributable (loss) of (0.75) per basic share. Our book value as of September 30, 2024 was 9.25 per share of common stock, inclusive of (5.18) per share of total CECL reserves. 
 As further described below, Distributable Earnings is a measure that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use Distributable Earnings to evaluate our performance, excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan portfolio and operations. In addition, Distributable Earnings is a performance metric we consider, along with other measures, when declaring our common stock dividends.

Distributable Earnings 
 In order to maintain our status as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income as dividends. Distributable Earnings is intended to over time serve as a general, though imperfect, proxy for our taxable income. As such, Distributable Earnings is considered a key indicator of our ability to generate sufficient income to pay dividends on our common stock, which is the primary focus of income-oriented investors who comprise a meaningful segment of our stockholder base. We believe providing Distributable Earnings on a supplemental basis to our net income (loss) and cash flow from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall operating performance of our business. 
 For reporting purposes, we define Distributable Earnings as net income (loss) attributable to our stockholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding: (i) non-cash equity compensation expenses; (ii) depreciation and amortization; (iii) any unrealized gains (losses) or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income (loss) for the applicable reporting period (regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or in net income (loss) for such period); and (iv) certain non-cash items and one-time expenses. Distributable Earnings may also be adjusted from time to time for reporting purposes to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other material non-cash income or expense items approved by a majority of our independent directors. The exclusion of depreciation and amortization from the calculation of Distributable Earnings only applies to debt investments related to real estate to the extent we foreclose upon the property or properties underlying such debt investments. 
 While Distributable Earnings excludes the impact of the unrealized non-cash current provision for credit losses, we expect to only recognize such potential credit losses in Distributable Earnings if and when such amounts are deemed non-recoverable. This is generally at the time a loan is repaid, or in the case of foreclosure, when the underlying asset is sold, but non-recoverability may also be concluded if, in our determination, it is nearly certain that all amounts due will not be collected. The realized loss amount reflected in Distributable Earnings will equal the difference between the cash received, or expected to be received, and the carrying value of the asset, and is reflective of our economic experience as it relates to the ultimate realization of the loan. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded provision for credit losses of (27.9) million and (164.2) million, respectively, which has been excluded from Distributable Earnings, consistent with other unrealized gains (losses) and other non-cash items pursuant to our existing policy for reporting Distributable Earnings referenced above. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded (1.9) million and (4.4) million, respectively, in depreciation and amortization on REO and related intangibles, which has been excluded from Distributable Earnings consistent with other unrealized gains (losses) and other non-cash items pursuant to our existing policy for reporting Distributable Earnings referenced above. 
 Distributable Earnings does not represent net income (loss) or cash flow from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss), or an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operations, a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. In addition, our methodology for calculating Distributable Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and, accordingly, our reported Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to the Distributable Earnings reported by other companies. 
 We believe it is useful to our stockholders to present Distributable Earnings before realized losses and recoveries to reflect our run-rate operating results as (i) our operating results are mainly comprised of net interest income earned on our loan investments net of our operating expenses, which comprise our ongoing operations, (ii) it helps our stockholders in assessing the overall run-rate operating performance of our business, and (iii) it has been a useful reference related to our common dividend as it is one of the factors we and our Board of Directors consider when declaring the dividend. We believe that our stockholders use Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings before realized losses and recoveries, or a comparable supplemental performance measure, to evaluate and compare the performance of our company and our peers.

 Loan Portfolio Overview 
 Our business model is mainly focused on directly originating, investing in and managing senior floating-rate commercial mortgage loans and other debt and debt-like commercial real estate investments. As a result of this strategy, our operating performance is subject to overall market demand for commercial real estate loan products and other debt and debt-like commercial real estate investments. We place emphasis on diversifying our investment portfolio across geographical regions and local markets, property types, borrowers and loan structures. We do not limit our loan originations by geographical area or property type so that we may develop a well-diversified investment portfolio. 
 Interest-earning assets include our 100 loan investment portfolio. At September 30, 2024, our loan portfolio was comprised of 62 investments, of which 61 were senior first mortgage loans totaling 2.4 billion of commitments with an unpaid principal balance of 2.3 billion, and one subordinated loan totaling 13.3 million in commitments and unpaid principal

balance. At September 30, 2024, the weighted average risk rating of our loan portfolio was 3.1 as compared to 2.8 at December 31, 2023, weighted by total unpaid principal balance. 
 We may hold REO as a result of taking title to a loan s collateral. As of September 30, 2024, we owned two office properties with an aggregate carrying value of 53.6 million, inclusive of 11.0 million of intangible assets included in other assets and other liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we funded 9.8 million under existing loan commitments and loan upsizes. We realized 240.1 million in aggregate reductions in portfolio unpaid principal balance from loan repayments,paydowns and amortization. See Note 3 - Loans Held-for-Investment, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detail.

(7) Loan was held on nonaccrual status as of September 30, 2024. 
 (8) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we completed a modification that included an adjustment in rate to a fixed rate coupon rate of 5.75 , adjusted from a floating rate coupon of S+3.40 . 
 Most of our loans are structured with an initial maturity term, typically three years, and one or more (typically two) one-year extension options, which can be exercised by the borrower subject to meeting various extension conditions in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. As part of our overall asset management strategy, we have in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, loan modifications with some of our borrowers. These amendments may include, among other things, modifying or waiving certain performance or extension conditions as part of the overall agreement. 
 
 The map and charts below, weighted by carrying value, illustrate the geographic distribution and types of properties securing our loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024: 

Portfolio Management and Credit Quality 
 We actively manage each loan investment from closing and initial funding through final repayment and assess the risk of credit deterioration by quarterly evaluating the performance of the underlying collateral properties. We also evaluate the macroeconomic environment, prevailing real estate fundamentals and local property market dynamics. Typically, our loan documents allow us, among other things, to receive regular property, borrower and guarantor financial statements; approve annual budgets and major tenant leases; and enforce loan covenants and remedies. In addition, we work with a leading commercial real estate loan servicer, which provides us with a fully-dedicated and experienced team to increase efficiency and

leverage our internal resources in servicing and asset managing our loan investments. Our internal team retains authority on all asset management decisions. 
 We maintain strong relationships and an active asset management dialogue with our borrowers. We have leveraged those relationships along with our team s experience to maximize the performance of our portfolio, including during periods of real estate market and economic uncertainty and volatility. While we generally believe that the principal amount of our loans is sufficiently protected by the underlying collateral value, there is a risk that we will not realize the entire principal amount of certain of our loan investments. 
 In addition to ongoing asset management, we review our entire portfolio quarterly, assess the performance of each loan and assign it a risk rating on a scale between 1 and 5, from least risk to greatest risk, respectively. The risk ratings are based on many factors, which include, but are not limited to, property type, geographic and local market dynamics, physical condition, leasing and tenant profile, projected cash flow, collateral performance, loan structure and exit plan, origination LTV, project sponsorship and other factors deemed appropriate. We evaluate these factors with respect to each loan investment on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration such loan s facts and circumstances at the time. The risk factors may be given different weightings depending on the specifics of each loan. See Note 3 - Loans Held-for-Investment, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion regarding the risk rating methodology we use for our portfolio. 
 The following table allocates the unpaid principal balance and the carrying value balances based on our internal risk ratings as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023: 
 (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Risk Rating Number of Loans Unpaid Principal Balance Carrying Value Number of Loans Unpaid Principal Balance Carrying Value 1 6 120,581 119,334 4 71,597 71,211 2 22 810,224 801,279 36 1,277,491 1,262,126 3 20 670,670 642,446 24 862,102 842,175 4 5 239,108 212,551 4 192,104 174,313 5 9 508,469 307,952 5 323,885 234,000 Total 62 2,349,052 2,083,562 73 2,727,179 2,583,825 
 As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average risk rating of our loan portfolio was 3.1, versus 2.8 as of December 31, 2023, weighted by unpaid principal balance. The change in the weighted average portfolio risk rating versus December, 31, 2023, is mainly a result of select loan risk rating downgrades partially offset by certain loan risk rating upgrades and resolutions of several previously risk-rated 5 loans. 
 
 Risk-Rated 5 Loans 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had nine loans that had a risk rating of 5 with an aggregate principal balance of 508.5 million, for which we recorded an allowance for credit losses of 200.3 million. These nine loans were on nonaccrual status as of September 30, 2024. The performance of these assets, which include five office buildings, two mixed-use properties with an office component and two hotel properties, has been adversely affected to varying degrees by many different factors, such as slower leasing velocity, including leasing challenges of office properties in certain markets related to work from home trends and other submarket dynamics, combined with a significant rise in interest rates contributing to a meaningful reduction in real estate transaction activity, capital markets volatility and limited market liquidity affecting property values and these borrowers ability to either sell or refinance their loans, and other property specific factors. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, as part of our quarterly risk rating process, we downgraded two senior loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of 86.0 million secured by an office property and a hotel property to a risk rating of 5 . These loans were downgraded due to the borrowers unwillingness to make further capital commitments to support the collateral properties resulting from a variety of factors, including the challenging office leasing environment, local market fundamentals, uncertain and volatile capital market conditions resulting in limited liquidity for real estate transactions, further pressure on property values and other factors related to property specific operating performance. These loans are considered collateral dependent and have been placed on nonaccrual status as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we resolved a previously risk-rated 5 senior loan with an unpaid principal balance of 37.1 million secured by a mixed-use retail and office property located in Los Angeles, CA. In connection with the resolution, we incurred a write-off of (22.3) million. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we resolved a previously risk-rated 5 senior loan with an unpaid principal balance of 33.3 million secured by a multifamily property located in Chicago, IL. In connection with the resolution we incurred a write-off of (3.3) million.

Table of Contents 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we modified a previously risk-rated 5 senior loan with an unpaid principal balance of 51.0 million as of June 30, 2024, secured by mixed-use multifamily, event space and office property located in Pittsburgh, PA, as described below. In connection with the modification, we incurred a write-off of (19.0) million. See further details below. 
 Other Portfolio Developments 
 Loan Modification Activity 
 Loan modifications and amendments are commonplace in the transitional lending business. We may amend or modify a loan depending on the loan s specific facts and circumstances. These loan modifications may include additional time for the borrower to refinance or sell the collateral property, adjustment or waiver of performance tests that are prerequisite to the extension of a loan maturity, and/or deferral of scheduled payments. In exchange for a modification, we often receive a partial repayment of principal, an accrual of deferral interest for a portion of interest due, a cash infusion to replenish interest or capital improvement reserves, termination of all or a portion of the remaining unfunded loan commitment, additional call protection, and/or an increase in the loan coupon or additional loan fees. 
 As noted above, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we completed the modification of a first mortgage loan secured by a mixed-use multifamily, event space and office property located in Pittsburgh, PA, with an outstanding principal balance of 51.0 million at the time of modification. The terms of the modification included, among others: (i) a new 2.0 million capital infusion from the sponsor to further support the collateral property; (ii) a restructuring of the 51.0 million whole loan into a 32.0 million senior loan, with a 7.0 million unfunded commitment, and a 19.0 million mezzanine note. The restructured senior loan earns a fixed rate coupon rate of 5.75 , adjusted from a floating rate coupon of S+3.40 , has an exit fee that was increased from 1.25 to 5.75 of the loan amount, and an extended maturity date of July 9, 2027. The mezzanine note is non-interest bearing and is subject to a distribution waterfall and is subordinate to certain amounts of sponsor s equity, as defined in the loan agreement. The loan had been considered collateral-dependent, had a risk rating of 5 and had previously been placed on nonaccrual status. As of September 30, 2024, the mezzanine note was deemed uncollectible, resulting in the write-off of (19.0) million noted above. 
 
 Portfolio Financing 
 As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio financing consisted of repurchase and secured credit facilities collateralized by loans held-for-investment and our one REO asset, and securitized debt obligations collateralized by pools of loans held-for-investment issued in CRE CLOs. Our non-mark-to-market financing sources accounted for approximately 56.1 of portfolio loan-level financing as of September 30, 2024.

Secured Repurchase Agreements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchase facilities in place with three counterparties with aggregate outstanding borrowings of 0.7 billion, which financed a portion of our loans held-for-investment and real estate owned. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average borrowing rate on our repurchase facilities was 8.5 , the weighted average advance rate was 64.6 , and the term to maturity ranged from approximately 0.6 years to approximately 0.8 years, with a weighted average remaining maturity of 0.8 years.

 (1) The facilities are set to mature on the stated maturity date, unless extended pursuant to their terms. 
 (2) Unused capacity is not committed as of September 30, 2024. 
 Under our existing repurchase facilities, our counterparties may make margin calls as a result of a perceived decline in the value of our assets collateralizing the given facility due to a credit event or, under a limited number of our repurchase facilities, due to market events. To cover a margin call, we may transfer cash or other collateral to such a counterparty. Should the value of our assets suddenly decrease, significant margin calls on our mark-to-market repurchase facilities could result, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. 
 Commercial Real Estate Collateralized Loan Obligations 
 We have financed certain pools of our loans through the issuance of CRE CLOs. At September 30, 2024, we had two CRE CLOs outstanding: GPMT 2021-FL4 and GPMT 2021-FL3, totaling 0.8 billion of outstanding borrowings, financing 33 of our existing first mortgage loan investments with an aggregate principal balance, inclusive of restricted cash, of 1.1 billion. As of September 30, 2024, our CRE CLOs financed 45.5 of our total loan portfolio principal balance on a term-matched, non-recourse and non-mark-to-market basis with attractive cost of funds.

 Financial Covenants 
 We are subject to a variety of financial covenants under our secured financing arrangements. The following represent the most restrictive financial covenants to which we are subject across our secured finance arrangements: 
 Financial Covenant 
 Description 
 Value as of September 30, 2024 
 Cash Liquidity 
 Unrestricted cash liquidity of no less than the greater of 30.0 million and 5.0 of recourse indebtedness, which was 12.4 million. 
 Unrestricted cash of 113.5 million 
 Tangible Net Worth 
 Tangible net worth greater than the sum of (i) 0.6 billion and (ii) 75.0 of net cash proceeds of equity issuances after September 30, 2024. As the Company has not had any equity issuances after September 30, 2024, tangible net worth must be greater than 0.6 billion. 
 Tangible net worth of 0.9 billion 
 Leverage Ratios 
 Target asset leverage ratio cannot exceed 77.5 and total leverage ratio cannot exceed 80.0 . 
 Target asset leverage ratio of 68.6 ; Total leverage ratio of 63.8 
 Interest Coverage Minimum interest coverage of no less than 1.20:1.0 through September 30, 2024 (1.1:1.0 from October 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024; 1.15:1.0 from January 1, 2025, through March 31, 2025; 1.2:1.0 from April 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025; and 1.3:1.0 thereafter). 
 Interest coverage of 1.3:1.0 
 
 We were in compliance with these financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 Leverage Ratios 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total debt-to-equity ratio with respect to our loans held-for-investment was 2.2:1.0, and our recourse leverage ratio was 1.0:1.0. The following table represents our recourse leverage ratio and total leverage ratio as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The period-over-period increase in our leverage ratios was mainly related to a decrease in total equity balance due to higher CECL reserves recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was partially offset by lower borrowings due to loan repayments and paydowns.

 Floating Rate Portfolio 
 Our business strategy seeks to minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates by matching benchmark indices on our assets with those on our asset level borrowings. Accordingly, our business model is such that, in general, rising interest rates will increase our net interest income, while declining interest rates will decrease our net interest income, subject to the impact of interest rate floors on our floating rate assets and certain liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, 96.7 of our loan investments by principal balance earned a floating rate of interest and were financed with liabilities that pay interest on a floating rate basis, which resulted in an amount of net floating rate exposure, subject to the impact of interest rate floors on certain of our floating rate loan investments, of 0.7 billion. As of September 30, 2024, 3.3 of our loan investments by principal balance earned a

fixed rate of interest and were financed with liabilities that pay interest on a floating rate basis, which resulted in a negative correlation to rising interest rates on that amount of our financing.

 Factors Affecting Our Operating Results 
 The results of our operations are affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the availability and cost of financing for us, the market value of our assets, the credit performance of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, commercial real estate loans, other commercial real estate debt instruments and other financial assets available for investment in the market and available as a source of refinancing of our assets. Our interest income, which reflects the amortization of origination fees and direct costs, is recognized based on the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the loans we originate. The objective of the interest method is to arrive at a periodic interest income that yields a level rate of return over the loan term. Interest rates vary according to the type of loan or security, conditions in the financial markets, credit-worthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by our borrowers. We continue to monitor the effects on each of these factors in light of the continued volatility in global markets, driven by investor concerns over inflation, elevated interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty, and how they will affect our operating results. 
 Loan Originations 
 Our business model is mainly focused on directly originating, investing in and managing senior floating-rate commercial mortgage loans and other debt and debt-like commercial real estate investments. As a result of this strategy, our operating performance is subject to overall market demand for commercial real estate loan products and other debt and debt-like commercial real estate investments. We manage originations and acquisitions of our target investments by diversifying our investment portfolio across geographical regions, local markets, property types, borrower types and loan structures. We do not limit our investments to any number of geographical areas or property types for our originations so that we develop a well-diversified investment portfolio. Additionally, our team has extensive experience originating and acquiring commercial real estate loans and other debt and debt-like commercial real estate investments, through a network of long-standing relationships with borrowers, sponsors and industry brokers. Investor concerns over inflation, elevated interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty have resulted in significant disruptions and volatility in financial markets, uncertainty about the overall macroeconomic outlook and a dislocation in the commercial real estate sector, including reduced borrower demand, wider credit spreads, higher lending rates, increased capitalization rates on properties and significantly lower transaction volume. This dislocation in capital markets and decline in real estate sale transaction and refinancing activities have negatively impacted, and will likely continue to negatively impact, the volume of loan repayments and prepayments on select property types (which are a significant source of our overall liquidity) and the volume of our originations of new loan investments. 
 Financing Availability 
 We are subject to the availability and cost of financing to successfully execute on our business strategy and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. Much of our financing is in the form of repurchase agreements or other types of credit facilities provided to us by our lender counterparties. We mitigate this counterparty risk by seeking to diversify our lending partners, focusing on establishing borrowing relationships with strong counterparties and continuously monitoring them through a thoughtful approach to counterparty risk oversight. Additionally, as part of our broader risk management strategy, and to the extent available in the market, we finance our business through other means, which may include, but are not to be limited to, securitizations, note sales and issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity instruments. We continue to actively explore additional types of funding facilities in order to further diversify our financing sources. Investor concerns over inflation trends, high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty have resulted in significant disruptions and volatility in financial markets and uncertainty about the overall macroeconomic and capital markets outlook. These conditions have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, real estate and real estate capital markets, which could make it more difficult for us to obtain or maintain financing. 
 We finance pools of our commercial real estate loans through CRE CLOs, retaining subordinate securities in our investment portfolio. Our CRE CLOs are accounted for as financings with the non-retained securitized debt obligations recognized on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our target investments. The performance and value of our investments depend upon sponsors ability to operate the properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and principal due to us. In addition, we are exposed to the risks generally associated with the 
 40 

Table of Contents 

commercial real estate market, including variances in occupancy rates, capitalization rates, absorption rates and other macroeconomic factors beyond our control such as the level of market interest rates. We try to mitigate these risks by seeking to originate or acquire assets of higher quality at appropriate rates of return given anticipated and unanticipated losses, by employing a comprehensive review and selection process and by proactively monitoring our investment portfolio. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses, including as a result of inflation, high interest rates, capital markets volatility and geopolitical uncertainty, could occur that could adversely impact our operating results. Volatility in market interest rates may result in fluctuations in cash flows and values of properties securing our loans. As a result, there may exist the risk of non-performance on our floating-rate loans, and in the case of a significant increase in interest rates, the cash flows of the collateral properties may not sufficiently cover debt service due under our loans, which may contribute to loan non-performance or, in certain cases, loan default. 
 The environmental, social and governance, or ESG, factors associated with our potential collateral and borrowers could also pose credit risks to us. We try to mitigate these risks by incorporating diligence practices into our investment process to identify significant ESG concerns related to a given investment. The nature and scope of our ESG diligence will vary based on the investment but may include a review of, among other things, energy management, pollution and contamination, accounting standards, bribery and corruption. 
 We employ a long-term, fundamental value-oriented investment strategy and we aim to, on a loan-by-loan basis, construct an investment portfolio that is well-diversified across property types, geographies and sponsors. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses, such as compensation costs and expenses related to managing our investment portfolio, may vary over time and are subject to a variety of factors, including overall economic and market environment, competitive market forces driving employee-related costs and other related factors. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Our operating results are also impacted by the allowance for credit losses we record for loans held-for-investment using the CECL methodology pursuant to ASU 2016-13. 
 Changes in the Fair Value of Our Investments 
 We intend to hold our target investments for the long-term and, as such, they are carried at an amortized cost on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Although we intend to hold our target investments for the long-term, we may occasionally invest in debt securities and classify them as available-for-sale, or AFS. Investments classified as AFS are carried at their fair value, with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity, rather than through earnings. We do not intend to hold any of our investments for trading purposes. 
 Changes in Market Interest Rates 
 Our primary interest rate exposures relate to the yield on our loans and other investments and the financing cost of our borrowings. Changes in interest rates have affected, and may continue to affect, our net interest income from loans and other investments. Interest rate fluctuations resulting in our interest and related expense exceeding interest and related income would result in operating losses for us. For further discussion of the potential impacts of changes in interest rates, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024 
 Net Interest Income 
 The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024: 
 (in thousands) Three Months Ended Income Statement Data: September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Q3 24 vs Q2 24 
 Interest income: (unaudited) Loans held-for-investment 43,031 46,882 (3,851) Cash and cash equivalents 1,266 1,597 (331) Total interest income 44,297 48,479 (4,182) Interest expense: Repurchase facilities 17,365 19,331 (1,966) Securitized debt obligations 16,521 18,303 (1,782) Secured credit facility 2,753 2,714 39 Total interest expense 36,639 40,348 (3,709) Net interest income 7,658 8,131 (473) 
 The majority of our interest-earning assets and liabilities have floating rates based on an index (e.g., one-month SOFR) plus a credit spread. As a result, our asset yields and cost of funds are impacted by changes in benchmark market short-term interest rates and credit spreads on investments and borrowings, as well as changes in the mix of our investment portfolio credit spreads due to new originations, loan amendments, additional fundings, upsizings, repayments and when certain loans are placed on nonaccrual status. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased to 44.3 million from 48.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, mainly due to a lower average balance of our interest-earning assets as a result of loan repayments. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased to 36.6 million from 40.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, mainly due to a lower average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The following table presents the components of (provision for) benefit from credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024: 
 (in thousands) Three Months Ended (Provision for) benefit from credit losses on: September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Loans held-for-investment (28,391) (60,561) Other liabilities 480 (195) Total (provision for) benefit from credit losses (27,911) (60,756) 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of (27.9) million as compared to (60.8) million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by recording a smaller increase in the allowance for credit losses for certain collateral-dependent loans that were individually assessed during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, as well as a recovery of amounts previously written-off, as described in Note 3. 
 Revenue from REO Operations 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded revenue from REO operations of 3.8 million as compared to 1.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in revenue from REO was due to the first full quarter of activity on the REO acquisition that occurred June 27, 2024.

Expenses 
 The following table presents the components of expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024: Three Months Ended (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Compensation and benefits 
 5,375 4,721 Servicing expenses

 5.6 4.6 Annualized core operating expense ratio (excluding non-cash equity compensation and expenses from real estate owned operations) 
 4.1 3.9 
 We incur compensation and benefits expenses, servicing expenses related to the servicing of commercial real estate loans, expenses from REO operations and other operating expenses. Compensation and benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased primarily due to higher non-cash equity compensation expense amortization as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. Servicing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased modestly primarily due to CLO servicing fees and special servicing fees related to select loans, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. Expenses from REO operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased primarily due to the first full quarter of activity on the REO acquisition that occurred on June 27, 2024, as compared to the prior quarter. Other operating expenses increased as compared to the prior quarter mainly due to higher professional fees. Our operating expense ratio, excluding REO, increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, mainly due to higher expenses and lower average equity driven by the net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 
 Net Interest Income 
 The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023: 
 (in thousands) Nine Months Ended Income Statement Data: September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Q3 24 vs Q3 23 
 Interest income: Loans held-for-investment 141,878 195,356 (53,478) Cash and cash equivalents 4,953 6,876 (1,923) Total interest income 146,831 202,232 (55,401) Interest expense: Repurchase facilities 57,424 64,630 (7,206) Securitized debt obligations 52,939 54,353 (1,414) Convertible senior notes 6,975 (6,975) Asset-specific financings 2,424 (2,424) Secured credit facility 8,156 9,182 (1,026) Total interest expense 118,519 137,564 (19,045) Net interest income 28,312 64,668 (36,356) 
 The majority of our interest-earning assets and liabilities have floating rates based on an index (e.g., one-month SOFR) plus a credit spread. As a result, our asset yields and cost of funds are impacted by changes in benchmark market interest rates and credit spreads on investments and borrowings, as well as changes in the mix of our investment portfolio credit spreads due to new originations, loan amendments, additional fundings, upsizings and repayments. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased to 146.8 million from 202.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to a higher average balance of nonaccrual loans and a lower average balance of our interest-earning assets driven by loan prepayments, partially offset by an increase in short-term interest rates.

Table of Contents 

Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased to 118.5 million from 137.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to lower average balances on portfolio level financing and corporate borrowings, partially offset by an increase in short-term interest rates. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The following table presents the components of (provision for) benefit from credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 (Provision for) benefit from credit losses on: Loans held-for-investment (164,436) (83,912) Other liabilities 217 676 Total (provision for) benefit from credit losses (164,219) (83,236) 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of (164.2) million as compared to (83.2) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by recording an increase in the allowance for certain collateral-dependent loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that were individually assessed in accordance with ASU 2016-13. 
 Revenue from REO Operations 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded revenue from REO operations of 6.0 million as compared to 1.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue from REO is due to the full year of activity on the REO acquisition that occurred on May 16, 2023, as well as the first full quarter of activity on the REO acquisition that occurred on June 27, 2024. 
 Expenses 
 The following table presents the components of expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023: Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Compensation and benefits

 5.0 4.1 Annualized core operating expense ratio (excluding non-cash equity compensation and expenses from real estate owned operations) 
 3.9 3.3 
 We incur compensation and benefits expenses, servicing expenses related to the servicing of commercial real estate loans, expenses from REO operations and other operating expenses. Compensation and benefits and servicing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, saw a decrease as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Expenses from real estate owned operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, increased due to the acquisitions of REO in May 2023 and June 2024. Other operating expenses saw an increase as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our operating expense ratio, excluding REO, increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to lower average equity mainly driven by higher CECL reserves.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Capitalization 
 To date, we have capitalized our business primarily through the issuance and sale of shares of our common and preferred stock, borrowings under our senior secured term loan facilities, secured financing facilities, issuance of CRE CLOs and the issuance and sale of convertible notes. As of September 30, 2024, our capitalization included 1.6 billion of loan-level financing. Our loan-level financing as of September 30, 2024, is generally term-matched or matures in 2024 or later, and includes 0.7 billion of secured repurchase agreements, 0.8 billion of CRE CLO securitizations, which are term-matched to the underlying assets, non-recourse and non-mark-to-market, and a 85.2 million term-matched and non-mark-to-market secured credit facility. 
 See Note 5 Variable Interest Entities and Securitized Debt Obligations , Note 6 Secured Financing Agreements and Note 7 Convertible Senior Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details regarding our securitized debt obligations, our secured financing facilities and our convertible senior notes, respectively. 
 Leverage 
 From June 30, 2024, to September 30, 2024, our debt-to-equity ratio, defined as total debt, net of cash, divided by total equity, increased from 2.5:1.0 to 2.2:1.0, mainly driven by a reduction in total outstanding debt. As part of our investment strategy, we plan to finance our target assets with a moderate amount of leverage, the level of which may vary based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio and market conditions. To that end, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act, we intend to use borrowings to fund the origination or acquisition of our target investments. Given our focus on senior floating-rate mortgage loans, we currently expect that such leverage will be, on a total debt-to-equity ratio basis, within a range of 3.0:1.0 and 3.5:1.0; however, our leverage may vary and differ from our expectations depending on market conditions and any steps we may take to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our liquidity position. The amount of leverage we deploy for our target investments depends upon our assessment of a variety of factors, which may include the anticipated liquidity and any changes in value of the investments in our portfolio, the potential for losses in our portfolio, the gap between the maturities of our assets and liabilities, the availability and cost of financing our investments, our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. economy and commercial real estate financing markets, our outlook for the level and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, the credit quality of our investments, the collateral underlying our investments and our outlook for investment credit spreads relative to SOFR. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, any approved but unused borrowing capacity under our financing facilities, the net proceeds of future public and private equity and debt offerings, payments of principal, including loan repayments and prepayments, loan sales, interest we receive on our portfolio of assets and cash generated from our operating results. 
 The following table sets forth our immediately available sources of liquidity as of September 30, 2024: 
 (in thousands) September 30, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents 113,461 Approved but unused borrowing capacity on financing facilities Total 113,461 
 We have access to liquidity through public offerings of debt and equity securities, subject to market and other conditions. To facilitate such offerings, in August 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that is effective for a term of three years and expires in August 2027. The amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed. We may offer and sell from time to time the securities described in this shelf registration in one or more offerings for an aggregate offering price of up to 500,000,000, subject to certain adjustments. The securities covered by this registration statement include: (i) common stock, (ii) preferred stock, (iii) depositary shares, (iv) debt securities, (v) purchase contracts, and (vi) purchase units. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering. At any time, and from time to time, we may be evaluating or pursuing one or more liquidity enhancing transactions, but we cannot provide any assurance if or when we will consummate any such transaction, or the terms thereof. 
 Although we generally intend to hold our target investments as long-term investments, we have opportunistically sold, and may again in the future sell, certain of our assets in order to manage our liquidity needs, to meet other operating objectives and to adapt to market conditions. We cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of our assets, if any. Since many of our assets are financed with secured financing facilities and/or CRE CLOs, a significant portion of the proceeds from sales of our assets, prepayments and scheduled amortization would be used to repay balances under these financing arrangements.

Table of Contents 

We remain focused on actively managing our balance sheet and liquidity to best position us for the market environment, to satisfy our loan future funding and financing obligations and to make new investments, which we expect will cause us to take, and in some instances has already caused us to take, some or all of the following actions: raise capital from offerings of equity and/or debt securities, on a public or private basis; borrow additional capital; post additional collateral; sell assets; and/or change our dividend policy, which we will continue to evaluate in respect of future quarters based upon customary considerations, including market conditions and distribution requirements to maintain our REIT status. At any given time and from time to time we may be evaluating or pursuing one or more transactions, including, but not limited to, loan sales, capital markets activities and other sources of funding, to improve our liquidity or to refinance our debt or may otherwise seek transactions to reduce our interest expense or leverage and extend our debt maturities, which transactions, depending on market conditions and other factors, could result in actual losses and/or otherwise negatively impact our results of operations in one or more periods. 
 Liquidity Needs 
 In addition to our loan origination activities and general operating expenses, our primary liquidity needs include interest and principal payments under our 1.6 billion of outstanding borrowings under our repurchase facilities, CRE CLOs, and secured credit facility; 109.5 million of unfunded loan commitments; and dividend distributions to our preferred and common stockholders, which are at the discretion of our board of directors. 
 Financing Availability 
 We are subject to the availability and cost of financing to successfully execute on our business strategy and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. Much of our financing is in the form of repurchase facilities or other types of credit facilities provided to us by our lender counterparties. We mitigate this counterparty risk by seeking to diversify our lending partners, focusing on establishing borrowing relationships with strong counterparties and continuously monitoring them through a thoughtful approach to counterparty risk oversight. Additionally, as part of our broader risk management strategy, and to the extent available in the market, we finance our business through other means which may include, but not be limited to, CRE CLOs, note sales and the issuance of unsecured debt and equity instruments. We continue to actively explore additional types of funding facilities in order to further diversify our financing sources. Investor concerns over inflation trends, high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty have resulted in significant disruptions in financial markets and uncertainty about the overall macroeconomic and capital markets outlook. These conditions have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, real estate fundamentals and real estate capital markets, which could make it more difficult for us to obtain or maintain financing. 
 The following table provides the maturities of the collateral underlying our repurchase facilities, secured credit facility and securitized debt obligations, as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023: 
 (in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Within one year 1,388,344 988,716 One to three years 218,541 962,424 Three to five years Five years and over Total 1,606,885 1,951,140 
 
 Cash Flows 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance decreased approximately 74.5 million, to 124.7 million. The cash movements can be summarized by the following: 
 Cash flows from operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities increased our cash balances by approximately 8.7 million, primarily driven by equity compensation and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. 
 Cash flows from investing activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investing activities increased our cash balances by approximately 299.2 million, primarily driven by repayments of loans held-for-investment. 
 Cash flows from financing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities decreased our cash balances by approximately 382.4 million, primarily driven by principal payments on repurchase facilities and securitized debt obligations, partially offset by proceeds from repurchase agreements. 
 
 Dividends 
 We generally intend to distribute substantially all of our taxable income each year (which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) to our stockholders to comply with the REIT provisions of the Code. In 
 46 

Table of Contents 

addition, our dividend policy remains subject to revision at the discretion of our board of directors. All distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, our actual results of operations and liquidity. These results, and our ability to pay distributions, will be affected by various factors, including our taxable income, our financial condition, our maintenance of REIT status, restrictions related to our financing facilities, applicable law and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. 
 
 Inflation 
 Nearly all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors typically influence our performance more than inflation does. However, changes in interest rates may correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. In response to the inflationary pressures, over the last couple of years the Federal Reserve has significantly increased its federal funds rate target range. Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions will be determined by our board of directors consistent with our obligation to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to maintain our REIT qualification; in each case, our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our investments, interest rates, liquidity and market value while, at the same time, seeking to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. While we are exposed to certain types of market risk in our business, we seek to actively manage them using our risk management infrastructure and philosophy centered around quantifying and measuring various market risks on a continuous basis. We seek to be fairly compensated through the returns we earn on our investments for taking those risks and focus on maintaining liquidity and capital levels consistent with the risks to which we are exposed. However, many of those risks have been magnified by the continuing economic disruption and capital markets volatility resulting from inflation, high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. 
 Recent Market Conditions 
 Due to the macroeconomic challenges driven by inflation trends, high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty, most of our borrowers, sponsors, their tenants, the properties serving as collateral for our loan investments and the economy as a whole have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected. See Macroeconomic Environment in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of current market conditions. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with holding a portfolio of our target investments. The performance and value of our investments depend upon the sponsors ability to operate the properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and principal due to us. We seek to manage credit risk by performing deep fundamental credit analysis of our potential investments, as well as seeking to originate or acquire assets of higher quality at appropriate rates of return given anticipated and unanticipated losses, by employing a comprehensive review and selection process and by proactively monitoring our investments. Credit risk is also addressed through our ongoing review, and our investment portfolio is monitored for variance from underwritten and expected results on a monthly basis, with more intense analysis and oversight done on a quarterly basis. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses, including as a result of inflation, high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty, could occur and could adversely impact our operating results. 
 We employ a long-term, fundamental value-oriented investment strategy and we aim to, on a loan-by-loan basis, construct an investment portfolio that is well-diversified across property types, geographies and sponsors. 
 We maintain an active dialogue and strong relationships with our borrowers as part of our overall asset management strategy to maximize the performance of our portfolio, including during periods of volatility. While we generally believe that the principal amount of our loans is typically sufficiently protected by the underlying collateral value, there is a risk that we will not realize the entire principal amount of certain of our loan investments. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our primary strategy is to originate, invest in and manage a portfolio of senior floating-rate commercial mortgage loans. As a result, the composition of our investments in general is such that rising interest rates increase our net income, while declining interest rates will decrease our net income, subject to the impact of contractual interest rate floors. From time to time, we may originate, acquire or otherwise hold fixed-rate investments, which may expose our operating results to the risks posed by fluctuations in interest rates, which we may choose to hedge, if we deem it prudent. 
 In response to inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark overnight interest rates on multiple occasions in 2022 and 2023. These increases in interest rates have increased, and may continue to increase, our interest expense, which may not be fully offset by any increases in interest income. In addition, these higher benchmark interest rates have increased our borrowers interest payments, adversely affected commercial real estate property values and, for certain of our borrowers have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to loan non-performance, modifications, defaults, foreclosures and/or property sales, which could result in us realizing losses on our investments. Recently, given the decline in the rate of inflation, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark overnight interest rates by 0.50 and indicated potential additional reductions in the future, depending on the macroeconomic data and other factors. However, interest rates remain high, and the future rate reductions and how long interest rates will remain at their current levels and the direction and extent of any future interest rate changes remain uncertain. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 96.7 of our portfolio by principal balance earned a floating rate of interest. The remaining approximately 3.3 of our portfolio earned a fixed rate of interest. If interest rates were to decline, the value of these fixed-rate investments may increase, and if interest rates were to increase, the value of these fixed-rate investments may fall; however, the interest income generated by these investments would not be affected by fluctuations in market interest rates. The interest rates we pay under our current secured financing facilities and CRE CLOs are primarily floating rate, which generally, and with limited exceptions, are not subject to contractual interest rate floors. Accordingly, our interest expense generally increases as interest rates increase and decreases as interest rates decrease. 
 Our analysis of risks is based on our experience, estimates and assumptions. Actual economic conditions or our implementation of decisions may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our analyses.

Table of Contents 

The information presented in the following interest rate sensitivity table projects the potential impact of sudden parallel changes in interest rates on our financial results and financial condition over the next 12 months, based on our interest sensitive financial instruments at September 30, 2024. All changes in value are measured as the change from our September 30, 2024, financial position. All projected changes in annualized net interest income are measured as the change from our projected annualized net interest income based off current performance returns. Actual results of changes in annualized net interest income may differ from the information presented in the sensitivity table below due to differences between the dates of actual interest rate resets in our loan investments and our floating rate interest-bearing liabilities, and the dates as of which the analysis was performed. 
 Changes in Interest Rates (in thousands) -100 bps -50 bps +50 bps +100 bps Change in value of financial position: Loans held-for-investment 671 340 (340) (680) Repurchase facilities (294) (147) 147 294 Securitized debt obligations (341) (170) 170 341 Secured financing facility (35) (18) 18 35 Total net assets 1 5 (5) (10) -100 bps -50 bps +50 bps +100 bps Change in annualized net interest income: (422) (321) 321 642 
 The interest rate sensitivity table quantifies the potential changes in annualized net interest income and portfolio value, should interest rates immediately change. The interest rate sensitivity table presents the estimated impact of interest rates instantaneously rising 50 and 100 basis points, and falling 50 and 100 basis points. The cash flows associated with the portfolio for each rate change are calculated based on assumptions with respect to interest rates and size of the portfolio. Assumptions made on the interest rate sensitive liabilities include anticipated interest rates, collateral requirements as a percentage of borrowings and amount and term of borrowing. 
 Certain assumptions have been made in connection with the calculation of the information set forth in the foregoing interest rate sensitivity table and, as such, there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at September 30, 2024. The analysis utilizes assumptions and estimates based on management s judgment and experience. Furthermore, while we generally expect to retain such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity, future originations, acquisitions and sales of assets could materially change our interest rate risk profile. 
 The information set forth in the interest rate sensitivity table above and all related disclosures constitutes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the foregoing interest rate sensitivity table. 
 Market Value Risk 
 We intend to hold our target investments for the long-term and, as such, they are carried at an amortized cost on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. However, we may occasionally classify some of our investments as available-for-sale, or AFS. Investments classified as AFS are carried at their fair value, with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity, rather than through earnings. The estimated fair value of such investments may fluctuate primarily due to changes in interest rates, overall market environment and liquidity and other factors. As market volatility increases or liquidity decreases, the market value of the investments may be adversely impacted. We do not intend to hold any of our investments for trading purposes. 
 Borrower Performance 
 In addition to the risks related to fluctuations in cash flows and investment values associated with movements in interest rates, there is also the risk of borrower non-performance on our floating-rate investments. If interest rates were to significantly rise, it is possible that the increased debt service costs may negatively impact operating cash flows on properties securing our commercial real estate loan investments, resulting in potential non-performance of our borrowers or, in severe cases, default. This risk is partially mitigated by various factors we consider during our rigorous underwriting and loan structuring process, which in certain cases include a requirement for our borrower to purchase an interest rate cap contract. 
 Capital Markets Risk 
 As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to accumulate significant operating cash flow and therefore requires us to utilize capital markets, both debt and equity, to finance our business. As a result, we are exposed to risks related to the equity capital markets and our related ability to raise capital

through the issuance of our common stock or other equity instruments. We are also exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets, and our related ability to finance our business through borrowings under credit facilities or other debt instruments, such as securitizations or unsecured debt. We seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the debt and equity capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount, timing and terms of capital we raise. 
 Various factors, such as elevated interest rates, inflation, geopolitical tensions and volatility in public equity and fixed income markets have led to increased cost and decreased availability of capital, which may adversely impact the ability of commercial property owners to service their debt obligations and refinance their loans as they mature and/or our ability to access capital markets. 
 Real Estate Risk 
 Our business strategy focuses on commercial real estate related debt investments. As a result, we will be exposed to the risks generally associated with the commercial real estate market, including occupancy rates, capitalization rates, absorption rates and other macroeconomic factors beyond our control. 
 Additionally, commercial real estate debt investments may be affected by a number of factors, including international, national, regional and local economic and real estate conditions, changes in business trends of specific industry segments, property construction characteristics, demographic factors and changes to laws and regulations, including additional restrictions or requirements on the development of commercial real estate intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Any combination of these factors may affect the value of real estate collateral for investments within our investment portfolio and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans, which could cause us to suffer losses. We seek to manage these risks through our rigorous and fundamentally driven underwriting and investment management processes. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Our liquidity risk is principally associated with our financing of longer-maturity investments with shorter-term borrowings, such as repurchase facilities. Should the value of our investments serving as collateral for our repurchase facilities significantly decrease, our lenders may exercise their margin call rights, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. If we fail to resolve such margin calls when due, the lenders may exercise their rights under such repurchase facilities, including requiring payment by us of our aggregate outstanding financing obligations and/or taking ownership of the collateral securing such obligations, potentially on an unfinanced basis, thereby reducing our available liquidity. Additionally, if one or more of our financing counterparties should choose not to provide ongoing funding, including with respect to future funding obligations on existing loans financed with such counterparties, our ability to finance our investments and related future funding obligations would possibly decline or exist at less advantageous terms. 
 Extension Risk 
 We manage our assets based on a variety of assumptions and estimates, including among others, assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay our loans or extend. If prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment or extension options are exercised, the life of our loan investments could extend beyond the term of the secured financing agreements. The current macroeconomic, commercial real estate and capital markets disruptions have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, a decrease in prepayment rates and an increase in the number of our borrowers who exercise loan extension options. In addition, higher interest rates imposed by the Federal Reserve to address inflationary pressures have led to, and may continue to lead to, a decrease in the pace of loan repayment and an increase in the number of our borrowers who exercise loan extension options. This could have a negative impact on our results of operations. In some situations, we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity, which could cause us to incur losses. 
 As part of our overall asset management strategy, we have in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, loan modifications with some of our borrowers. These amendments may include, among other things, modifying or waiving certain performance or extension conditions as part of the overall agreement, which are often coupled with additional equity or other forms of credit support from the sponsor. We work closely with our lending counterparties when negotiating and entering into loan modifications with our borrowers to ensure we maintain financing on modified assets. There can be no assurance that going forward we will be able to maintain financing on modified loans. 
 Risk Management 
 To the extent consistent with maintaining our REIT qualification, we seek to manage risk exposure by closely monitoring our portfolio and actively managing the financing, interest rate, credit and other risks associated with holding a portfolio of our target investments. Generally, we: 
 manage our portfolio with focus on diligent, investment-specific market review, enforcement of loan and security rights and timely execution of disposition strategies; 
 actively employ portfolio-wide and investment-specific risk measurement and management processes in our daily operations, including utilizing risk management tools; and 
 seek to manage credit risk through our rigorous underwriting due diligence process prior to origination or acquisition of our target investments, and through the use of nonrecourse financing when and where available and appropriate.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 A review and evaluation was performed by our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that review and evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and implemented, were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Although our CEO and CFO have determined our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the reports we submit under the Exchange Act. 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
