of the Company s common stock based on a per share price equal to the market price on the date of appraisal of . As the first
acquisition by the Company in Belize and an important milestone, the Company expects to rebrand the Casamora Awaysis Assets, so it is
easily identifiable as an Awaysis Property and fit perfectly with its strategy of creating a countrywide network of Awaysis residential
enclave communities in the country. 

Company
History 

The
Company was formed in Delaware on September 29, 2008 under the name ASPI, Inc. 

On
May 18, 2022, the Company changed its name from JV Group, Inc. to Awaysis Capital, Inc. In connection with this name change, we changed
our ticker symbol from ASZP to AWCA and effective May 25, 2022, we began trading on the OTC Market under
our new symbol. 

In
December 2021, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Awaysis Capital, LLC, a Florida single member limited liability corporation to hold
the office lease and to become the master payroll company for Awaysis Capital, Inc. 

We
also formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Awaysis Casamora Limited, a Belize single member limited liability corporation to hold the title
to the acquisition of the Casamora assets. 

From
October 2015 to February 2022, we were a publicly quoted shell company seeking to merge with an entity with experienced management and
opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create values for our shareholders. In February 2022, the Board
of Directors of the Company determined to pursue a business strategy of acquiring, developing and managing residential vacation home
communities in desirable travel destinations. 

In
September 2024, our Board of Directors and holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, approved of a reverse split of
up to 1-for-20 of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the Reverse Split and authorized our Co-CEOs, in
their sole discretion, to determine the final ratio and effective date. We have not yet determined the final ratio or the effective date
for the Reverse Split, nor will we commence the Reverse Split unless and until we deem it appropriate. 

The
Company s principal executive office is located at 3400 Lakeside Drive, Suite 100, Miramar, FL 33027 and its main number is 855-795-3377.
The Company s website address is www.awaysisgroup.com. The information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website
is not incorporated by reference and is not a part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

We
determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ROU as assets, operating lease non-current liabilities, and operating lease current liabilities in our balance sheet. Finance leases are
property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other non-current liabilities in the balance sheet. 

ROU
assets represent the right to use an asset for the lease term and lease liability represent the obligation to make lease payment arising
from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease
payments over lease term. As most of the leases don t provide an implicit rate, we generally use the incremental borrowing rate
on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating
ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payment is recognized on a straight-line
basis over lease term. 

As
of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we were party to an operating lease agreement which commenced during the fiscal year ended June
30, 2023. 

See
Note 10 below for details of lessee leases during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

The
Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its
obligations under each of its agreements: 

Step
1: Identify the contract(s) with customers 

Step
2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract 

Step
3: Determine the transaction price 

Step
4: Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations 

Step
5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation 

The
Company is a development stage corporation, and we have identified certain revenue streams during this development stage. 

The
Company currently derives its revenue primarily from the short-term unit rentals of sold and unsold inventory at the resort we own and
manage. 

Revenue
from rentals is recognized over the period in which a guest completes a stay. 

Other
services consist of revenue derived from our real estate brokerage and other related services. 

Other
Services 

In
addition to providing vacation rental platform services, the Company provides other services including real estate brokerage and management
services. The purpose of these services is to attract and retain homeowners as customers of the Company s vacation rental platform.
As such, the Company enters into an exclusive rental management contract with each homeowners associations it controls. Under
the real estate brokerage services, the Company assists home buyers and sellers in listing, marketing, selling and finding homes. Real
estate commissions earned by the Company s real estate brokerage business are recorded as revenue at a point in time which is upon
the closing of a real estate transaction (i.e., purchase or sale of a home). The commissions the Company pays to real estate agents are
recognized concurrently with associated revenues and presented as cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Under
the homeowners association management services, the Company provides or would provide common area property management, community
governance, and association accounting services to community and homeowner associations in exchange for a management fee and other incrementally
billed services. The services represent an individual performance obligation in which the Company has determined it is primarily responsible.
Revenue is recognized over time as services are rendered for the management fee and incrementally billed services are recognized at a
point in time.

This second note was fully paid on August 8, 2022. 

Convertible
Note Payable Related Party 

On
June 26, 2024, the Board approved a million convertible bridge loan to the Company by Harthorne, bearing an annual interest rate
of . The note is due June 19, 2025 unless sooner paid in full or converted in accordance with the terms of conversion at per
share. 

As
of June 30, 2024, the Company accounted for convertible notes payable in accordance with ASC 470-20. A beneficial conversion feature
is a non-detachable conversion feature that is in the money at the commitment date, which requires recognition of interest
expense for underlying debt instruments and a deemed dividend for underlying equity instruments. A conversion option is in the money
if the effective conversion price is lower than the commitment date fair value of a share into which it is convertible. 

As
of June 30, 2024 and per ASU 470-20, the excess of the fair value of the convertible note is and the discount in the amount
of is amortized over a -year period with a maturity date of . 

As
of June 30, 2024, the net balance of Notes related party was . The net balance consists of the principle of the note of
 and the discount on the beneficial conversion feature of ) . This discount is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the life of the note. The current amortization of the discount (recorded as interest expense) is . 

As
of July 1, 2024, the Company is required to adopt ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and options (subtopic 470-20), and
all related amendments on July 1, 2024 on a full retrospective basis. This new standard removed guidance in ASC 470-20 that required
separate accounting for beneficial conversion features and amended disclosure requirements. Per the new guidance, the convertible
debt can be accounted for as a single liability unit and eliminates the beneficial conversion feature. 

As
the convertible loan was approved by the Board on June 26, 2024, the retrospective impact of this adoption effects the financials only
for the year ended June 30, 2024. The financial impact is removing the discount on the beneficial conversion feature and the related
amortization from the liability and equity section of the financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2024. This accounted for an
increase in the liabilities by related to the Discount on beneficial conversion of feature and the related amortization
of , an increase to retained earnings beginning balance related to the interest expense from the amortization of the discount
on beneficial conversion feature of , and a decrease to equity of related to additional paid in capital beneficial
conversion feature.

Forward-Looking
Statements 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and related notes included in Item 1, Financial
Statements, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Certain information contained in this MD A includes forward-looking
statements. Statements which are not historical reflect our current expectations and projections about our future results, performance,
liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, prospects and opportunities and are based upon information currently available
to us and our management and their interpretation of what is believed to be significant factors affecting our existing and proposed business,
including many assumptions regarding future events. Actual results, performance, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations,
prospects and opportunities could differ materially and perhaps substantially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking
statements as a result of various risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those risks described in detail in the section entitled
 Risk Factors on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on October 17, 2023. 

Forward-looking
statements, which involve assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies, and expectations, are generally identifiable by use
of the words may, should, would, will, could, scheduled, 
 expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend, seek, 
or project or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. 

In
light of these risks and uncertainties, and especially given the nature of our existing and proposed business, there can be no assurance
that the forward-looking statements contained in this section and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will in fact occur.
Potential investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities
laws, there is no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events, changed circumstances or any other reason. 

Overview 

Awaysis
Capital, Inc. is a real estate management and hospitality company focused on acquisition, redevelopment, sales, and managing rentals
of residential vacation home communities in desirable travel destinations. We seek to create value through the targeting and acquisition,
development, and up-cycling, rebranding, and repositioning of currently undervalued operating and shovel ready residential/resort communities
in global travel destinations, with the intention to relaunch these assets under the Awaysis brand with the goals of creating
a network of residential and resort enclave communities that will optimize both sales and rental revenues, providing attractive returns
to owners and exceptional vacation experiences to travelers. Our strategy overlays the quality and consistency of the hotel management
system over the Airbnb type rental model. 

Increased
global trends towards work from home opportunities has impacted both residency and travel. We believe that more people
are seeking comfortable and convenient places to travel, visit, and live for extended durations. We seek to capitalize on these trends
by transforming residential/resort properties in desirable locations into convenient enclaves that facilitate this type of travel or
residency. We define an enclave as a gated community that has all the amenities that will allow a person to live, work and play without
having to leave the community. 

The
Company seeks to own, grow and manage a stable, cash generating, diversified portfolio of single-family and luxury resort/residence properties
in the Caribbean, Europe, South America, and the United States. 

We
are a licensed real estate corporation in the State of Florida and maintain compliance with the Florida Real Estate Commission, the entity
that regulates companies providing real estate services such as rentals, management, and sales. Additionally, our business is subject
to federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations that may vary depending on the geographical location and classification
of our individual properties. Hospitality operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act and
other laws and regulations relating to accessibility, and to laws, regulations and standards in other areas such as zoning and land use,
licensing, permitting and registrations, safety, environmental and other property condition matters, staffing and employee training,
and cleanliness/sanitation protocols. 

Our
business strategy entails targeting and identifying undervalued assets in emerging markets located in proximity to high demand travel
destinations. The Company intends to focus these efforts on shovel-ready properties and/or other assets that we believe can be used to
optimize sales and rental revenues. We have currently identified five properties in the country of Belize, all of which are expected
to constitute our initial real estate portfolio. To that effect, on June 30, 2022, we closed on the acquisition of certain real estate
assets in San Pedro, Belize (the Casamora Awaysis Assets ), pursuant to our previously announced series of Agreements of
Purchase and Sale, all dated April 15, 2022. The total consideration paid by us for the properties subject to the agreements was at the
appraisal value of 11.4 million (excluding transaction costs and fees) and was settled in a combination of a Purchase Money Mortgage
of 2.6 million at 0 interest rate, payable on demand, a Purchase Money Mortgage of 280,000 at 0 interest rate that was paid on August
8, 2022 and 56.8 million shares of the Company s common stock based on a per share price equal to the market price on the date
of appraisal of 0.150. As the first acquisition by the Company in Belize and an important milestone, the Company expects to rebrand
the Casamora Awaysis Assets, so it is easily identifiable as an Awaysis Property and fit perfectly with its strategy of creating a countrywide
network of Awaysis residential enclave communities in the country for owners and guests to travel, work and play.

Our
Business 

Our
business is expected to include real estate development and sales, hospitality rentals, resort operations and club management. Revenues
are expected to come from: 

selling
 our own developed resort inventory that includes Condominiums, Single Family Homes, and Villas. 

providing
 management services to our branded resorts under HOA management agreements; and 

manage
 short-term unit rentals of sold and unsold inventory at the resorts we own or manage. 

The
Casamora Awaysis development, our first property, has started its hospitality operations and has commenced sales operations on or about
June 1, 2023. 

As
of September 30, 2024, Awaysis has a total of six units available for rent. Four of these units consist of Company owned villas. The
Company maintains a rental agreement with the owners of the other two units, both of which are a part of the Company s rental pool.
Awaysis has also entered into a one-year lease agreement, effective April 1, 2024, on a three bedroom condominium located in the commercial
building adjacent to the Casamora Resort Property. This unit has been listed for sale. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we estimate approximately 3,000,000 in construction cost projections for the remaining portions of the Casamora
property. As development progresses, and more units are expected to become rentable, we expect an increase in hospitality revenues. 

In
September 2024 the Company entered into leases for the renting out of commercial space at Casamora, enabling an increase in rental income
of 16,000 per month in the aggregate. 

As
development progresses, and more units are expected to become rentable, increased hospitality operations are expected over the coming
months. 

Results
of Operations 

We
commenced activities and started to incur material costs in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, as a result of our change in control
transaction in November 2021 and commencement in February 2022 of our business strategy of acquiring, developing, and managing residential
vacation home communities in desirable travel destinations. Our business strategy continued throughout the fiscal year ended June 30,
2024, showing substantial growth in operating expenses in preparation for expected future growth in revenue. 

We
have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern
and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

We
expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through,
among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. We recently commenced rentals of a few rental ready units and
expect increasing sales to also generate cash flow for working capital. 

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024, as Compared to September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

We
recognized revenue of 44,119 and 6,800 - during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Revenue generated
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of monthly rental income and commissions from short term property rentals.
Revenue generated during the three months ended September 30, 2023 also consisted of monthly rental income from property rentals. The
increase in revenue from the three months ended September 2023 to 2024 was a result of having units available for rent in 2024 that were
not available in the prior year period. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred sales and marketing expenses of 61,916 and 3,021, respectively, consisting
of marketing and support of our products and services, promotional and public relations expenses, and management and administration expenses
in support of rental offerings and marketing. The increase in sales and marketing expenses from the three months ended September 30,
2023 to 2024 is due to an increased focus on marketing expenses as construction is completed and units become available for rent. 

17 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred general and administrative expenses of 649,071 and 3,535,607, respectively,
consisting of audit and accounting fees, travel and entertainment, payroll and employee benefits, legal fees, filing fees and transfer
agent fees, all relating to both sustaining the corporate existence of the Company and public company-related expenses and its continued
transitioning from being a shell company to an operating company. The decrease in general and administrative expenses from the three
months ended September 30, 2023 to 2024 mostly relates to bonuses of over 2.6 million paid during the three months ended September 30,
2023 that were not included during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Operating
Loss 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized operating losses of (666,868) and (3,531,828), respectively. These
losses were primarily attributable to the Company transitioning from being a shell company to an operating company under its current
management and brand along with the deployment of its sales, marketing, and acquisition initiatives. The decrease in operating loss from
the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2024 was a result of decreased expenses related to salary and payroll bonuses, increased
revenue from units being available for rent, and other details as described in this section. 

Other
Income (Expenses) 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred other income and expense of 27,206 and 0, respectively, consisting
of interest expense of 33,054 offset by other income of foreign exchange gains and interest earned of (5,848) 

Net
Loss 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized net losses of (694,074) and (3,531,828), respectively. These losses
were primarily attributable to accounting, marketing, legal, filing fees and transfer agent fees to sustaining the corporate existence
of the Company and public company related expenses, and the continued transitioning from being a shell company to an operating company.
The decrease in net loss from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2024 was a result of decreased expenses related to salary
and payroll bonuses, increased revenue from units being available for rent, and other details as described above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 234,367 and had a positive working capital of 2,664,034, which was mainly from the issuance
of shares for real estate inventory and the sale of shares from our private placement of common stock and the June 2024 loan of
 1,100,000 to the Company from an affiliate. We have sufficient cash or commitments for funding to satisfy our basic operations for
at least 12 months, and expect the anticipated cost of development of our first properties to come from a 5 million line of credit
commitment we expect to consummate in full in the second fiscal quarter of 2025, and of which on November 15, 2025 we drew drown a first tranche of 250,000. We will need to raise additional cash to satisfy
our medium and long-term requirements. 

Historically,
an affiliate shareholder has advanced funds on our behalf as we have required for the Company to become, and remain, a fully reporting
public company while seeking to create value for shareholders. The shareholder has indicated its intention to continue to do so and most
recently loaned 1,100,000 to the Company; provided, however, that such intentions do not represent a binding commitment by the affiliate
shareholder and there is no guarantee that it will be able to provide the funding necessary to achieve this objective. To date, the affiliate
shareholder has advanced an aggregate of approximately 378,673 on behalf of the Company to cover certain of the Company s expenses
and loaned an additional 1,100,000 for bridge financing. A different entity, which is an affiliate of one of our Co-CEOs, is the lender under our 5 million line of credit
commitment. 

Raising
debt or equity funding for small publicly quoted, penny stock companies is extremely challenging. We can provide no assurance that funding
will be available in the amounts it needs or on terms acceptable to it, if at all. If we are not able to secure adequate additional acquisition
and construction capital when it becomes needed, we may be required to make reductions in our acquisition strategy, and/or suspend or
curtail planned acquisitions and developments. Any of these actions could materially harm our existing and planned business. 

Our
plan for satisfying our cash requirements and to remain operational beyond the next 12 months or to further expand our asset base is
through the generation of rental revenues, sale of shares of our capital stock to third parties, and advances from our affiliate
shareholder or other affiliates. While we are seeking to raise up to 10 million through the sale of our common stock or through
other offerings of securities, we cannot assure you we will be successful in raising any or all of such capital and in meeting our
working capital needs. Since November 23, 2021, we raised an aggregate of 1,918,000 in our private placement, and we can give no
assurance that we will be successful in raising the remaining funds being sought, including 943,000 shares of common stock that were
subscribed, contractually obligated and committed to be issued but have not yet been issued pending payment therefor. We have also
issued shares of our common stock in lieu of cash to cover compensation obligations to our executives. The capital raises from
issuances of equity securities or other issuances has resulted in and could result in additional dilution to our shareholders. In
addition, to the extent we determine to incur indebtedness, our incurrence of debt could result in debt service obligations and
operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities 

Net
cash flows used in operating activities were (410,248) and 20,630 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The net cash used in operations primarily consisted of the selling, marketing, and general expenses that resulted from the company recently
going operational, transferring of inventory assets to assets placed in service as the units become available for rent, and issuance
of stock for services provided and payroll. 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash flow used for investing activities was (101,376) and 1,849 respectively.
This consisted of payments for building improvements related to assets that have been placed in service. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash from financing activities was 0 and 0, respectively. 

We
are dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund our ongoing construction and to execute our business
plan. In addition, we are dependent upon our controlling shareholders to provide continued funding and capital resources. If continued
funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our plan of operations. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
Company applies judgment and estimates that may have material effect in the eventual outcome of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
accounts receivable, inventory and goodwill. The following explains the basis and the procedure where judgment and estimates are applied. 

Inventories 

New
real estate inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of finished inventories determined on the specific
identification method is removed from inventories and recorded as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue is recognized. In
addition, an allocation of depreciation and amortization is included in cost of goods sold. Under the specific identification method,
if finished real estate inventory can be sold for a profit there is no basis to write down the inventory below the lower of cost or net
realizable value. 

As
per ASC 970-340-25-18, once the property is considered substantially complete, the capitalization of costs typically ceases. The entity
stops adding new costs to the property s carrying value except for additional improvements or costs that extend the asset s
life or improve its utility. This means that these types of costs are no longer added to the property s carrying value once the
property is substantially completed and held for rental. Instead, these costs are expensed as incurred, unless they directly enhance
the property or extend its useful life. 

Once
the property is held for rental and substantially complete, the property is classified as a depreciable real estate asset and the total
cost capitalized to date up to the point of substantial completion becomes the asset s carrying amount. The cost of the property s
carrying amount (less its land value) is allocated over its estimated useful life. 

Costs
incurred after the property is completed and held for rental are generally expensed unless they extend the property s useful life
(ASC 970-340-35-3).

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Company needs to implement disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s
Exchange Act reports are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an assessment, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our then existing disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b).
As of the date of this assessment, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures, primarily as a result of the Company s recent failure to timely file certain forms
or reports under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company s management is seeking to remedy
this deficiency. 

This
Form 10-Q does not include an attestation report from our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant
to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this Form 10-Q. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control
that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

In
addition to the below, please see the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on October 11, 2024. 

We
have been unable to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, which could result in our stock price and investor confidence
being materially and adversely affected. 

We
are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are effective. To date, we have identified ineffective disclosure controls
and procedures, mainly relating to the failure to timely file certain reports under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The past and current failure of controls or absence of adequate controls could result in a material adverse effect on our
business and financial results, resulting in downwards pressure on our stock price and decreasing investor confidence. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

In
August 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 15,150 shares of its common stock as consideration for services rendered in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2024, that were accounted for in such prior period. The securities were issued in private transactions in reliance
upon an exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, as transactions not involving any public offering. 

In
September 2024, the Company issued 32,428 shares of its common stock as consideration for services rendered. The securities were issued
in private transactions in reliance upon an exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, as transactions
not involving any public offering. 

All
other unregistered issuances of equity securities during the period covered by this quarterly report have been previously disclosed on
