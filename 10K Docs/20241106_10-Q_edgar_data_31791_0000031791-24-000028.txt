The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where the Company has been named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. The Company expects that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded. 
 The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings, regulatory matters, and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. Although the Company has established accruals for

 Overview of the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 
 Our overall revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was 684.0 million which increased by 13.3 million, or 2 , as compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, reflecting an increase of 20.2 million, or 6 , in our Diagnostics segment revenue, which was partially offset by a decrease of 6.9 million, or 2 , in our Life Sciences segment revenue. The increase in our Diagnostics segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was driven by increased demand in our immunodiagnostics and reproductive health businesses, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our applied genomics business. The decrease in our Life Sciences segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was driven by a decrease in instruments and software revenue, partially offset by an increase in reagents revenue. 
 Our consolidated gross margins increased 72 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, primarily due to higher sales volume and productivity gains. Our consolidated operating margins increased from 10 to 14 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, primarily due to higher sales volume, productivity gains and cost containment. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to accounting for business combinations, divestitures, long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, and employee compensation and benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Critical accounting policies are those policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe our critical accounting policies include policies regarding business combinations, divestitures, valuation of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles and employee compensation and benefits. 
 For a more detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to the Notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (our 2023 Form 10-K ), as

 The decrease in interest income for the three months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to the three months ended October 1, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in marketable securities and short-term investments. Interest expense was lower for the three months ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the same period in prior year primarily due to a lower debt balance as a result of the repayment of senior unsecured notes that matured in September 2023. 
 The increase in interest income for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended October 1, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in marketable securities and short-term investments and higher interest rates. Foreign exchange losses and other expense, net, was lower for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the same period in prior year mainly due to a foreign exchange loss of 23.3 million that was recognized during the nine months ended October 1, 2023, related to the cash proceeds from the sale of the Business that were held offshore.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2024 was lower primarily due to a net favorable impact of return to provision adjustments in foreign locatio ns of 7.1 million. The effective tax rate for the three months ended October 1, 2023 was higher primarily due to a discrete tax expense of 29.8 million related to unfavorable developments in respect of an uncertain tax position with a foreign tax authority, partially offset by a discrete tax benefit related to a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority of 15.2 million. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 was lower primarily due to a net favorable impact of return to provision adjustments in foreign locations of 10.8 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations, borrowing capacity available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and access to debt markets. We anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, smaller acquisitions, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock, in the foreseeable future, including at least in the next 12 months. However, we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due, any larger acquisitions and other long-term liabilities. The sale of the Business generated approximately 2.27 billion in cash proceeds. We expect to continue to use these proceeds for a combination of opportunistic share r epurchases and continued strategic and value creating acquisitions.

As of September 29, 2024, we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of 31.1 million, of which 13.0 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and 18.1 million was recorded in long-term liabilities. The maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods is 7.2 years from September 29, 2024, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at September 29, 2024 was 4.4 years. 
 Distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability, creating increased volatility in security prices, widening credit spreads, increasing the cost of borrowings and decreasing valuations of certain investments. The widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. Increases in credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable, could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. In difficult global financial markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities or fund our strategic transactions. 
 Our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets. During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we contributed 5.2 million, in the aggregate, to pension plans outside of the United States, and expect to contribute an additional 1.7 million by the end of fiscal year 2024. We could potentially have to make additional contributions in future periods for all pension plans. We expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans. 
 We and our subsidiaries may from time to time, in our sole discretion, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities (including any publicly issued debt securities), in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, or extend or refinance any of our outstanding indebtedness. 
 Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include: 
 changes in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and 
 changes in our working capital requirements and capital expenditures. 
 Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include: 
 financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity, 
 increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt, 
 a ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,

 increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, 
 a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and 
 volatility in the public debt and equity markets. 
 Cash Flows 
 Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities of our continuing operations was 489.5 million for th e nine months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to 58.8 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2023, an increase of 430.7 million, primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and less cash used for investments in working capital during the nine months ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended October 1, 2023. The cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 was principally a result of income from continuing operations of 194.7 million, adjustments for non-cash charges aggregating to 373.7 million, including depreciation and amortization of 322.8 million, and a net cash decrease in working capital of 78.9 million. The cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended October 1, 2023 was principally a result of income from continuing operations of 115.9 million, and adjustments for non-cash charges aggregating to 417.0 million, including depreciation and amortization of 326.2 million, as well as net cash decrease in working capital of 474.1 million.

 Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was 935.2 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to 927.5 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2023, an increase in net cash used in financing activities of 7.7 million. During the nine months ended September 29, 2024 , we made net payments of 722.3 million on debts , as compared to 510.8 million duri ng the nine months ended October 1, 2023. During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we repurchased shares of our common stock for a total cost of 184.4 million, as compared to 384.0 million in the prior year period. We paid 8.8 million for acquisition-related contingent consideration during the nine months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to 10.1 million in the prior year period. We paid 25.9 million in dividends for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to 26.3 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2023. The cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 29, 2024 was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans of 6.2 million during the nine months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to 3.7 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2023. 
 Borrowing Arrangements 
 During the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 , we paid in full 711.5 million of outstanding 0.850 Senior Unsecured Notes that became due in September 2024. See Note 6, Debt, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 13, Debt , to our audited consolidated financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of our borrowing arrangements. 

Dividends 
 Our Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.07 per share for each of the first three quarters of fiscal year 2024 and in each quarter of fiscal year 2023. At September 29, 2024, we had accrued 8.5 million for dividends declared on July 25, 2024 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 that will be paid in November 2024 . On October 24, 2024, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of 0.07 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 that will be payable in February 2025. In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.

 Effects of Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 On January 1, 2024, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 and it will first apply to the annual disclosures for the year ending December 29, 2024, which we are in the process of drafting. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation , in the Notes to the Consolidated Statements for a detailed discussion. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. We briefly describe several of the market risks we face below. Our market risks are not materially different from the disclosure provided under the heading, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Value-at-Risk Disclosure . We continue to measure foreign currency risk using the Value-at-Risk model described in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our 2023 Form 10-K. The measures for our Value-at-Risk analysis have not changed materially. 
 Interest Rate Risk. Our debt portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed interest debt; however, there i s 1.4 million of variable rate instruments. Our cash and cash equivalents, for which we receive interest at variable rates, were 1,229.8 million at September 29, 2024. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short-term cash flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures. However, no such instruments are outstanding at September 29, 2024. 
 Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity . Our 2023 Form 10-K presents sensitivity measures for our interest rate risk. The measures for our sensitivity analysis have not changed materially. More information is available in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our 2023 Form 10-K for our sensitivity disclosure. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of our fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of our fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at September 29, 2024 should not have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations: 
 Risks Related to our Business Operations and Industry 
 If the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions, or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals, or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations, we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations. 
 Our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, laboratories, academic and research institutions, public health authorities, private healthcare organizations, doctors and government agencies. Our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect. Negative fluctuations in our customers markets, the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding, restrictions in capital expenditures, general economic conditions, cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. In addition, government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and trading price of our common stock, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability. 
 Our growth and profitability are subject to global economic and political conditions, and operational disruptions at our facilities. 
 Our business is affected by global economic and political conditions as well as the state of the financial markets, particularly as the United States and other countries balance concerns around debt, inflation, growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives. There can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows, results of operations, financial position or our ability to access capital, such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the United States and internationally. Our business is also affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession, financial liquidity, interest rates and currency volatility or devaluation. Environmental events and political changes, including war or other conflicts, such as the current conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, some of which may be disruptive, could interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location. 
 While we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities, a major earthquake, fire, flood, power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties, cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. 
 Certain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments, or other measures, and some of these risks are insurable, but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful. Our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments.

 If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets. 
 We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving customer needs and industry standards. Many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies, substantial intellectual property portfolios, substantial experience in new product development, regulatory expertise, manufacturing capabilities, and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers. Our products could become technologically obsolete over time, or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining, in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to: 
 accurately anticipate customer needs, 
 innovate and develop new reliable technologies and applications, 
 receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner, 
 successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, 
 price our products competitively, and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and 
 differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings. 
 Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers expectations. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. We may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner. 
 In addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications. 
 We may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or divestitures, license technologies, integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses, maintain licensed technologies, or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable. 
 We have in the past supplemented, and may in the future supplement, our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines. However, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, such as: 
 competition among buyers and licensees, 
 the high valuations of businesses and technologies, 
 the need for regulatory and other approval, and 
 our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions. 
 Some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable, or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition. If, for example, we are unable to successfully commercialize products and services related to significant in-process research and development that we have capitalized, we may have to impair the value of such assets. Accordingly, the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we would have to improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, such as incompatible management, information or other systems, cultural differences, loss of key personnel, unforeseen regulatory requirements, previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results. We may lose the right to utilize licensed technologies which could limit our ability to offer products incorporating such technologies. To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us. We may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies, or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies, which may adversely impact our profitability.

 If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed. 
 We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines. 
 Our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders. 
 Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed in the short term, due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs. As a result, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include: 
 demand for and market acceptance of our products, 
 competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices, 
 changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business, including as a result of global health crises or pandemics, 
 changes in general economic conditions or government funding, 
 settlements of income tax audits, 
 expenses incurred in connection with claims related to environmental conditions at locations where we conduct or formerly conducted operations, 
 contract terminations, adverse litigation outcomes, and litigation costs, 
 differing tax laws and changes in those laws (including the enactment by countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Pillar Two, which would impose a minimum corporate income tax rate of least 15 ), or changes in the countries in which we are subject to taxation, 
 changes in our effective tax rate, 
 changes in industries, such as pharmaceutical and biomedical, 
 changes in the portions of our revenue represented by our various products and customers, 
 our ability to introduce new products, 
 our competitors announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations, 
 costs of raw materials, labor, energy, supplies, transportation or other indirect costs, 
 changes in healthcare or other reimbursement rates paid by government agencies and other third parties for certain of our products and services, 
 our ability to realize the benefit of ongoing productivity initiatives, 
 changes in the volume or timing of product orders, 
 fluctuation in the expense related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans, 
 changes in our assumptions underlying future funding of pension obligations, 
 changes in assumptions used to determine contingent consideration in acquisitions, and 
 changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

 A significant disruption in third-party package delivery and import/export services, or significant increases in prices for those services, could interfere with our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability. 
 We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies, including UPS and Federal Express in the United States; TNT, UPS and DHL in Europe; and UPS in Asia. We also ship our products through other carriers, including commercial airlines, freight carriers, national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the United States Postal Service. If one or more of the package delivery or import/export providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers. 
 Disruptions in the supply of raw materials, certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. 
 The production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply. We generally have multi-year contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers, but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and, in some cases, validate new raw materials. Such raw materials, key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price, decline in quality or delay in delivery. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. In addition, global health crises or pandemics, wars, conflicts, or other changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions, could have a significant adverse effect on our supply chain. 
 We are subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials known as conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, gold, tungsten and their derivatives) that may be contained in our products are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. As a result of these rules, we may incur additional costs in complying with the disclosure requirements and in satisfying those customers who require that the components used in our products be certified as conflict-free, and the potential lack of availability of these materials at competitive prices could increase our production costs. 
 If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. 
 Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers and scientists, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees. 
 Our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 
 If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or those of our customers, suppliers or other third parties, or cybercrime, resulting in inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information or assets or result in a ransom demand from a third party, or if we fail to implement new systems, software and technologies successfully, our business could be adversely affected. 
 We rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to develop, manufacture and provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our and our third-party service providers' information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. The risk of a security breach or disruption through cyber-attacks has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks from around the world have increased. For example, many companies have experienced an increase in phishing and social engineering attacks from third parties. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers, suppliers or other third parties, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant 
 36

 incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems or cybercrime, resulting in inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information or assets, could result in losses or misappropriation of assets, ransom demands by third parties, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage. 
 Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets. 
 As of September 29, 2024, our total assets included 9.3 billion of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights, trademark rights, customer relationships, core technology and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. We test goodwill at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair value of the reporting unit to which it is assigned. All of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets. 
 Adverse changes in our business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Risks Related to our Intellectual Property 
 We may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property. 
 Patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products, processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage, although it is time-consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents. Patent applications we file, however, may not result in issued patents or, if they do, the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products, processes and technologies. The expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide. Similarly, applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed. For our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret, such as trade secrets and know-how, we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property. 
 Third parties have in the past and may in the future also challenge the validity of our issued patents, may circumvent or design around our patents and patent applications, or claim that our products, processes or technologies infringe their patents. In addition, third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks. We may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties. Claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the United States or other countries. 
 If we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights, we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage. 
 We may not be able to renew or otherwise lose our right to utilize our existing licenses, or licenses we may obtain in the future, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in-license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share. 
 Our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market, or incur losses for failing to comply with our contractual obligations. In some cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the licensed patent, or a third-party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses.

 Risks Related to Legal, Government and Regulatory Matters 
 The manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product and other liability claims for which we could have substantial liability. 
 We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product and other liability claims if our products, services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury, damage or loss. We may be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we obtain. If we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted. 
 If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration and other governmental agencies in the United States and abroad, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil, criminal or monetary penalties. 
 Our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the United States and other countries, as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies. If we fail to comply with those regulations or standards, we could be subject to fines, penalties, criminal prosecution or other sanctions. Some of our products are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or standards, we may have to recall products, cease their manufacture and distribution, and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution. 
 We are also subject to a variety of laws, regulations and standards that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of toxic or hazardous substances, the collection, storage, transfer, use, disclosure, retention and other processing of personal data, and our business practices in the United States and abroad such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption and competition laws. This requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws, regulations and standards. A failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil, criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 We are subject to stringent data privacy and information security laws and regulations and changes in such laws or regulations, or our failure to comply with such requirements, could subject us to significant fines and penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to data privacy and information security laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage and use of personally identifying information, which among other things, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of personal information, including comprehensive regulatory systems in the United States, European Union and the United Kingdom. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve in jurisdictions worldwide, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. Failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in enforcement actions against us, including fines, claims for damages by affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. 
 We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, data privacy and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products. 
 The healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations, we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations. 
 The healthcare industry, including the genetic screening market, is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations. We believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters, the scope and effect of which we cannot predict. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare

 programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business. 
 Risks Related to our Foreign Operations 
 Economic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability. 
 Because we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States represented the majority of our total revenue in fiscal year 2023. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: 
 changes in actual, or from projected, foreign currency exchange rates, 
 global health crises of unknown duration, 
 wars, conflicts, or other changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets, 
 longer payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions, 
 trade protection measures including embargoes, sanctions and tariffs, such as the sanctions and other restrictions implemented by the United States and other governments on the Russian Federation and related parties in connection with the conflict in Ukraine, 
 import or export licensing requirements and the associated potential for delays or restrictions in the shipment of our products or the receipt of products from our suppliers, 
 policies in foreign countries benefiting domestic manufacturers or other policies detrimental to companies headquartered in the United States, 
 differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax, 
 adverse income tax audit settlements or loss of previously negotiated tax incentives, 
 differing business practices associated with foreign operations, 
 difficulty in transferring cash between international operations and the United States, 
 difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, 
 differing labor laws and changes in those laws, 
 differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection, 
 expanded enforcement of laws related to data protection and personal privacy, 
 increasing global enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and 
 differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements. 
 Risks Related to our Debt 
 We have a substantial amount of outstanding debt, which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business. 
 
 We have a substantial amount of debt and other financial obligations. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: 
 requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions and stock repurchases; 
 reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; 
 exposing us to interest rate risk as a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates; 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 increasing our foreign currency risk as a portion of our debt obligations are in denominations other than the U.S. dollar; and 
 increasing the chances of a downgrade of our debt ratings due to the amount or intended purpose of our debt obligations. 
 We may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase. In addition, the market for both public and private debt offerings has experienced liquidity concerns and increased volatility, which could ultimately increase our borrowing costs and limit our ability to obtain future financing. 
 Restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities. 
 Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, senior unsecured notes due in 2026 2026 Notes ), senior unsecured notes due in 2028 2028 Notes ), senior unsecured notes due in 2029 2029 Notes ), senior unsecured notes due in March 2031 March 2031 Notes ), senior unsecured notes due in September 2031 September 2031 Notes and senior unsecured notes due in 2051 2051 Notes include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company. These include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: 
 pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, 
 sell assets, 
 incur obligations that restrict our subsidiaries ability to make dividend or other payments to us, 
 guarantee or secure indebtedness, 
 enter into transactions with affiliates, and 
 consolidate, merge or transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 
 We are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating, our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments. 
 Any future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the 2026 Notes, the 2028 Notes, the 2029 Notes, the March 2031 Notes, the September 2031 Notes, the 2051 Notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments, which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments, and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock 
 Our share price will fluctuate. 
 Over the last several years, stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility. Both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects. In addition to the risk factors discussed above, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by: 
 operating results that vary from our financial guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, 
 the financial performance of the major end markets that we target, 
 the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us, 
 announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors, 
 changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, inflation, freight costs, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets, and 
 changes to economic conditions arising from global health crises and pandemics, climate change, or from wars or conflicts.

 Terms of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock

 II. Dividends and Distributions 
 (A) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock, par value 1 per share (the Common Stock ), of the Corporation, and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of dividends, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date ), commencing on the first quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series C Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) 1 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series C Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. 
 (B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series C Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock) and the Corporation shall pay such dividend or distribution on the Series C Preferred Stock before the dividend or distribution declared on the Common Stock is paid or set apart provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of 1 per share on the Series C Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. 
 Revvity Proprietary Information

Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series C Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pre rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Director may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof. 
 III. Voting Rights 
 The holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights 
 (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. 
 (B) Except as otherwise provided herein, by law, or in any other Certificate of Vote of Directors creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation. 
 (C) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series C Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, voting as a separate series from all other series of Preferred Stock and classes of capital stock, shall be entitled to elect two members of the Board of Directors in addition to any Directors elected by any other series, class or classes of securities and the authorized number of Directors will automatically be increased by two. Promptly thereafter, the Board of Directors of this Corporation shall, as soon as may be practicable, call a special meeting of holders of Series C Preferred Stock for the purpose of electing such members of the Board of Directors.

 Meetings of Stockholders may be held within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or elsewhere in the United States of America to the extent permitted by the By-laws of the Corporation. 
 The Directors may make, amend, or repeal the By-laws of the Corporation in whole or in part at any meeting of the Directors by vote of a majority of the Directors then in office, except that the provisions thereof fixing the place of the meetings of Stockholders, designating the number necessary to constitute a quorum at meetings of the Stockholders, governing procedure with respect to the removal of Directors, and affording indemnification to Directors or officers may be made, amended, or repealed only by the Stockholders. 
 The number of Directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be such number, not less than three nor more than thirteen, as shall be fixed by vote of the stockholders or the Board of Directors. During the time periods specified in this Article 6, the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes in respect of term of office, each class to contain, as nearly as possible, one-third of the whole number of the Board.

At each Annual Meeting of Stockholders, commencing with the Annual Meeting in 1996, the successors of the Directors whose terms expire in that year shall be elected to serve until the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held in the following year (and until their successors shall be duly elected and qualified), so that, upon the expiration in 1998 of the terms of the Directors elected at the Annual Meeting in 1995, all Directors shall be elected to hold office for a one-year term. A vacancy in the Board of Directors, however occurring, unless and until filled by the stockholders, may be filled by the Directors. The number of the Board of Directors may be increased or decreased and one or more additional Directors elected at any special meeting of the stockholders or by a vote of the Directors then in office. For so long as the Directors are divided into classes in accordance with the terms of this Article 6, Directors who are elected to fill vacancies, whether or not created by an enlargement of the Board, shall be apportioned among the classes so as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as possible. Directors who are elected to fill vacancies, whether or not created by an enlargement of the Board, shall serve until the expiration of the term of his or her predecessor 
 
 Revvity Proprietary Information 

and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Directors. 
 A Director may be removed from office (a) with or without cause, by vote of two-thirds of the stock outstanding and entitled to vote in the election of Directors, provided that the Directors of a class elected by a particular class of stockholders may be removed only by the vote of two-thirds of the shares of such class which are outstanding and entitled to vote or (b) for cause by vote of a majority of the Directors then in office. A Directors may be removed for cause only after reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard before the body proposing to remove him. 
 To the fullest extent permitted by Chapter 156B of the Massachusetts General Laws, as it exists or may be amended, a Director of this Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a Director, notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such liability.
