 (a) Financial Advisory is comprised of a wide array of financial advisory services regarding M A advisory, capital markets advisory, shareholder advisory, restructuring and liability management, sovereign advisory, geopolitical advisory and other strategic advisory and capital raising and placement work for clients. The benefits of these advisory services are generally transferred to the Company s clients over time, and consideration for these advisory services typically includes transaction completion, transaction announcement and retainer fees. Retainer fees are generally fixed and recognized over the period in which the advisory services are performed. However, transaction announcement and transaction completion fees are variable and subject to constraints, and they are typically not recognized until there is an announcement date or a completion date, respectively, due to the uncertainty associated with those events. Therefore, in any given period, advisory fees recognized for certain transactions may relate to services performed in prior periods. The advisory fees that may be unrecognized as of the end of a reporting period, primarily comprised of fees associated with transaction announcements and transaction completions, generally remain unrecognized due to the uncertainty associated with those events. 
 (b) Management fees and other is primarily comprised of management services. The benefits of these management services are transferred to the Company s clients over time. Consideration for these management services generally includes management fees, which are based on assets under management and recognized over the period in which the management services are performed. The selling or distribution of fund interests is a separate performance obligation within management fees and other, and the benefits of such services are transferred to the Company s clients at the point in time that such fund interests are sold or distributed. 
 (c) Incentive fees is primarily comprised of management services. The benefits of these management services are transferred to the Company s clients over time. Consideration for these management services is generally variable and includes performance or incentive fees. The fees allocated to these management services that are unrecognized as of the end of the reporting period are generally amounts that are subject to constraints due to the uncertainty associated with performance targets and clawbacks. 
 In addition to the above, contracts with clients include trade-based commission income, which is recognized at the point in time of execution and presented within other revenue. Such income may be earned by providing trade facilitation, execution, clearance and settlement, custody, and trade administration services to clients. 
 With regard to the disclosure requirement for remaining performance obligations, the Company elected the practical expedients permitted in the guidance to (i) exclude contracts with a duration of one year or less; and (ii) exclude variable consideration, such as transaction completion and transaction announcement fees, that is allocated entirely to unsatisfied performance obligations. Excluded variable consideration typically relates to contracts with a duration of one year or less, and is generally constrained due to uncertainties.

 Compensation and benefits expense relating to share-based awards with service and/or performance conditions is reversed if the awards are forfeited due to these conditions not being met. Compensation and benefits expense relating to share-based awards with market-based conditions is not reversed if these awards are forfeited based solely on failing to meet such market-based conditions. 
 The Company periodically assesses forfeiture rates, including as a result of any applicable performance conditions. A change in estimated forfeiture rates or performance results in a cumulative adjustment to compensation and benefits expense and also would cause the aggregate amount of compensation expense recognized in future periods to differ from the estimated unrecognized compensation expense described below. 
 The Company s share-based incentive plans and awards are described below. 
 RSUs and PRSUs 
 RSUs generally require future service as a condition for vesting (unless the recipient is then eligible for retirement under the Company s retirement policy or is a non-executive member of the Board of Directors) and convert into shares of common stock on a basis after the stipulated vesting periods. The grant date fair value of the RSUs, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, is expensed over the requisite service periods (generally, one-third after two years and the remaining two-thirds after the third year), and is adjusted for actual forfeitures over such period. 
 RSUs generally include a dividend participation right during the applicable vesting period, which is payable in additional units. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, dividend participation rights required the issuance of an aggregate units of RSUs. 
 In connection with RSUs and PRSUs that settled during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company satisfied its minimum statutory tax withholding requirements in lieu of delivering and shares, respectively, of common stock during such nine month period. Accordingly, and shares, respectively, of common stock held by the Company were delivered during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 PRSUs are a type of RSU that is incrementally subject to performance-based and service-based vesting conditions and a market-based condition. The number of shares of common stock that a recipient receives upon vesting of a PRSU is calculated by reference to certain performance-based and market-based metrics that relate to Lazard, Inc. s performance over a period. The target number of shares of common stock subject to each PRSU is ; however, based on the achievement of both the performance-based and market-based conditions, the number of shares of common stock that may be received will range from to times the target number. PRSUs vest on a single date approximately

 PIPRs 
 PIPRs are equity incentive awards that, subject to certain vesting and other conditions described below, may be exchanged for shares of common stock pursuant to the 2018 Plan. They are a class of membership interests in the Company that are intended to qualify as profits interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are recorded within members equity in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. 
 PIPRs, with the exception of Stock Price PIPRs SP-PIPRs ), as explained below, generally provide for vesting approximately following the grant date, so long as applicable vesting and other conditions have been satisfied. PIPRs are subject to continued employment and other conditions and restrictions and are forfeited if those conditions and restrictions are not fulfilled. 
 A recipient generally realizes value from PIPRs only to the extent that applicable vesting and other conditions are satisfied, and an amount of economic appreciation in the assets of the Company occurs as necessary to satisfy certain partnership tax rules (referred to as the Minimum Value Condition ), otherwise the PIPRs will be forfeited. Upon satisfaction of such conditions, PIPRs that are in parity with the value of common stock will be exchanged on a basis for shares of common stock. If forfeited based solely on failing to meet the Minimum Value Condition, or, if applicable, common stock price milestones as described below, the associated compensation expense would not be reversed. 
 All PIPR awards are subject to service-based vesting conditions. In addition to PIPR awards with only service based vesting conditions Ordinary PIPRs granted to certain of our executive officers and a limited number of employees, the Company has granted the following types of PIPRs to certain of our executive officers, that are subject to additional vesting and market-based conditions:

 The number of shares of common stock that a recipient will receive upon the exchange of a P-PIPR award is calculated by reference to applicable performance-based vesting conditions and, beginning with P-PIPRs granted in 2021, incremental market-based conditions and only result in value to the recipient to the extent the vesting and other conditions are satisfied. The target number of shares of common stock subject to each P-PIPR is . Based on the achievement of performance conditions, as determined and approved by the Compensation Committee, the number of shares of common stock that may be received in connection with the P-PIPR awards granted prior to February 2021 will range from to times the target number. For the P-PIPR awards granted beginning in February 2021, subject to both performance-based and incremental market-based conditions, the number of shares that may be received will range from to times the target number. Unless applicable vesting and other conditions are satisfied during the performance period, and the Minimum Value Condition is satisfied within following the grant date, all P-PIPRs will be forfeited. 
 
 SP-PIPRs are eligible to vest in tranches (each, a Tranche based on the achievement of service conditions and Tranche-specific common stock price milestones measured as of a specified anniversary of the date of grant, as described below. Their aggregate fair value at the grant date, which based on the estimated probability of achieving the common stock price milestones is approximately , is expensed over the requisite service periods. 
 
 Each Tranche, as described below, is subject to the executive s continued employment through the applicable anniversary of the date of grant and requires that the applicable common stock price milestone is sustained for any consecutive day period prior to the anniversary of the date of grant of the applicable Tranche (the Expiration Date ).

 Compensation expense recognized for ordinary PIPRs and P-PIPRs is determined by multiplying the number of shares of common stock underlying such awards that, based on the Company s estimate, are considered probable of vesting, by the grant date fair value. Compensation expense recognized for SP-PIPRs is determined by multiplying the number of shares of common stock underlying such awards by the grant date fair value. As of September 30, 2024, the total estimated unrecognized compensation expense of all profits interest participation rights was and the Company expects to expense such amount over a weighted-average period of approximately years subsequent to September 30, 2024. 
 LFI and Other Similar Deferred Compensation Arrangements 
 In connection with LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, granted to eligible employees, which generally require future service as a condition for vesting, the Company records a prepaid compensation asset and a corresponding compensation liability on the grant date based upon the fair value of the award. The prepaid asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the applicable requisite service periods (which are generally similar to the comparable periods for RSUs) and is charged to compensation and benefits expense within the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. LFI and similar deferred compensation arrangements that do not require future service are expensed immediately. The related compensation liability is accounted for at fair value as a derivative liability, which contemplates the impact of estimated forfeitures, and is adjusted for changes in fair value primarily related to changes in value of the underlying investments.

 Business Summary 
 Lazard, one of the world s preeminent financial advisory and asset management firms, operates in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia. With origins dating to 1848, we have long specialized in crafting solutions to the complex financial and strategic challenges of a diverse set of clients around the world, including corporations, governments, institutions, partnerships, family offices and individuals. 
 Our primary business purpose is to serve our clients. Our deep roots in business centers around the world form a global network of relationships with key decision-makers in corporations, governments and investing institutions. This network is both a competitive strength and a powerful resource for Lazard and our clients. As a firm that competes on the quality of our advice, we have two fundamental assets: our people and our reputation. 
 We operate in cyclical businesses across multiple geographies, industries and asset classes. In recent years, we have deepened our sector expertise and enhanced our specialized insights in geopolitical advisory, private equity and capital solutions in our financial advisory business and we have invested in our global investment and distribution platform in our asset management business to further drive performance. Companies, government bodies and investors seek independent advice with a geographic perspective, deep understanding of capital structure, informed research and 
 43 

knowledge of global, regional and local economic conditions. We believe that our business model as an independent advisor will continue to create opportunities for us to attract new clients and key personnel. 
 Our principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in the following business segments: 
 Financial Advisory, which offers corporate, partnership, institutional, government, sovereign and individual clients across the globe a wide array of financial advisory services regarding strategic and M A advisory, capital markets advisory, shareholder advisory, restructuring and liability management, sovereign advisory, geopolitical advisory, and other strategic advisory matters and capital raising and placement, and 
 Asset Management, which offers a broad range of global investment solutions and investment and wealth management services in equity and fixed income strategies, asset allocation strategies, alternative investments and private equity funds to corporations, public funds, sovereign entities, endowments and foundations, labor funds, financial intermediaries and private clients. 
 In addition, we record selected other activities in our Corporate segment, including the management of cash, investments and outstanding indebtedness. We also invest our own capital from time to time, generally alongside capital of qualified institutional and individual investors in alternative investments or private equity investments, and make investments to seed our Asset Management strategies. 
 Our consolidated net revenue was derived from the following segments: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Financial Advisory 47 51 55 52 Asset Management 38 54 39 50 Corporate 15 (5) 6 (2) Total 100 100 100 100 
 
 Business Environment and Outlook 
 Economic and global financial market conditions can materially affect our financial performance. As described above, our principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in our Financial Advisory and Asset Management business segments. Our Financial Advisory revenues are primarily dependent on the successful completion of merger, acquisition, sale, restructuring, capital raising or similar transactions, and our Asset Management revenues are primarily driven by the levels of AUM. Weak global economic and financial market conditions can result in a challenging business environment for M A and capital-raising activity as well as our Asset Management business, but may provide opportunities for our restructuring business. 
 Despite geopolitical uncertainty, there are ongoing economic and market improvements relevant to our Financial Advisory and Asset Management businesses. As inflation continues to moderate, Central Banks have begun to lower interest rates. M A activity continues to rebound, and financing conditions are favorable. The third quarter ended on a strong note for equity and bond markets with U.S. equity markets posting all-time closing highs. 
 Our outlook with respect to our Financial Advisory and Asset Management businesses is described below. 
 Financial Advisory M A announcements for deals greater than 500 million are up year-over-year with 2023 being at their lowest levels in a decade. We remained actively engaged with our clients. The global scale and breadth of our Financial Advisory business, with particular strength in both the U.S. and Europe, enables us to advise on a wide range of strategic and restructuring transactions across a variety of industries. Throughout 2024, we continue to see increased M A activity occurring alongside greater restructuring and liability management activity based upon upcoming debt maturities. In addition, we continue to invest in our Financial Advisory business by selectively hiring talented senior professionals in an effort to enhance our capabilities and sector expertise in M A, capital structure, restructuring, and public and private capital markets. 
 44 

Asset Management Given our diversified, actively managed investment platform and our ability to provide investment solutions for a global mix of clients, we believe we are positioned to benefit from opportunities across the asset management industry. We are continually developing new investment strategies that extend our existing platforms and assessing potential product acquisitions or other inorganic growth opportunities. 
 We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge continuously, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all potentially applicable factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Form 10-K. Furthermore, net income and revenue in any period may not be indicative of full-year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter. 
 Overall, we continue to focus on the development of our business, including the generation of revenue growth, earnings growth and member returns, the evaluation of potential growth opportunities, the investment in new technology to support the development of existing and new business opportunities, the evaluation of other strategic alternatives, the prudent management of our costs and expenses, the efficient use of our assets and the return of equity to our members. 
 Certain industry wide market data with respect to our Financial Advisory and Asset Management businesses is included below.

 Source: Dealogic as of October 2, 2024. 
 Another measure of global restructuring activity is the number of corporate defaults, which decreased during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. The number of defaulting issuers was 107 in the 
 45 

first nine months of 2024 according to Moody s Investors Service, Inc., as compared to 127 in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Net revenue trends in Financial Advisory are generally correlated to the level of completed industry-wide M A transactions and restructuring transactions occurring subsequent to corporate debt defaults, respectively. However, deviations from this relationship can occur in any given year for a number of reasons. For instance, our results can diverge from industry-wide activity where there are material variances from the level of industry-wide M A activity in a particular market where Lazard has greater or lesser relative market share, or regarding the relative number of our advisory engagements with respect to larger-sized transactions, and where we are involved in non-public or sovereign advisory assignments. 
 Asset Management 
 The percentage change in major equity market indices at September 30, 2024, as compared to such indices at June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and at September 30, 2023, is shown in the table below:

 The fees that we receive for providing investment management and advisory services are primarily driven by the level of AUM and the nature of the AUM product mix. Accordingly, market movements, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in our AUM product mix will impact the level of revenues we receive from our Asset Management business when comparing periodic results. A substantial portion of our AUM is invested in equities. Movements in AUM during the period generally reflect the changes in equity market indices. 
 
 Financial Statement Overview 
 Net Revenue 
 The majority of Lazard s Financial Advisory net revenue historically has been earned from advice and other services provided in M A transactions. The amount of the fee earned can vary depending upon the type, size and complexity of the transaction Lazard is advising on. M A fees can be earned as a retainer, working fee, announcement fee, milestone fee, opinion fee or transaction completion fee. Most fees are paid upon completion of a transaction, the timing of which can be impacted by delays due to securing financing, board approvals, regulatory approvals, shareholder votes, changing market conditions or other factors. 
 Our restructuring and liability management team advises on situations where our clients are financially distressed, providing advice on financial debt restructurings, liability management and M A. Bankruptcy proceedings may require court approval of our fees. The capital markets advisory team advises both public and private issuers on the raising of capital, while the private capital advisory team provides fundraising and secondary advisory services for private equity, private credit, real estate and real assets-focused investment firms. Additionally, Lazard earns fees from providing strategic advice to clients, which may include shareholder advisory, geopolitical advisory and other strategic advisory matters, with such fees not being dependent on the completion of a transaction. 
 Our Financial Advisory businesses may be impacted by overall M A activity levels in the market, the level of corporate debt defaults and the environment for capital raising activities, among other factors. 
 Significant fluctuations in Financial Advisory net revenue can occur over the course of any given year, because a significant portion of such net revenue is earned upon the successful completion of a transaction, restructuring or capital raising activity, the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to Lazard s control. 
 Lazard s Asset Management segment principally includes LAM, LFG, Lazard Fr res Banque SA LFB and the Edgewater Funds Edgewater ). Asset Management net revenue is derived from fees for investment management and 
 46 

advisory services provided to clients. As noted above, the main driver of Asset Management net revenue is the level and product mix of AUM, which is generally influenced by the performance of the global equity markets and, to a lesser extent, fixed income markets as well as Lazard s investment performance, which impacts its ability to successfully attract and retain assets. As a result, fluctuations (including timing thereof) in financial markets and client asset inflows and outflows for any reason have a direct effect on Asset Management net revenue and operating income. Asset Management fees are generally based on the level of AUM measured daily, monthly or quarterly, and an increase or reduction in AUM, due to market price fluctuations, currency fluctuations, changes in product mix, or net client asset flows will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees. Our investment advisory contracts are generally terminable at any time or on notice of 30 days or less. Institutional and individual clients, and firms with which we have strategic alliances, can terminate their relationship with us, reduce the aggregate amount of AUM or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for a number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance. In addition, as Lazard s AUM includes significant amounts of assets that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars, changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies will impact the value of Lazard s AUM and the overall amount of management fees generated by the AUM. Fees vary with the type of assets managed and the vehicle in which they are managed, with higher fees earned on equity assets and alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds and private equity funds, and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products. 
 The Company earns performance-based incentive fees on various investment products, including traditional products and alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds and private equity funds. 
 For hedge funds, incentive fees are calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund s net appreciation, in some cases in excess of established benchmarks or thresholds. The Company records incentive fees on traditional products and hedge funds at the end of the relevant performance measurement period, when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined. The incentive fee measurement period is generally an annual period (unless an account terminates or redemption occurs during the year). The incentive fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback. Incentive fees on hedge funds are often subject to loss carryforward provisions in which losses incurred by the hedge funds in any year are applied against certain gains realized by the hedge funds in future periods before any further incentive fees can be earned. 
 For private equity funds, incentive fees may be earned in the form of a carried interest if profits arising from realized investments exceed a specified threshold. Typically, such carried interest is ultimately calculated on a whole-fund or investment by investment basis and, therefore, clawback of carried interest toward the end of the life of the fund can occur. As a result, the Company recognizes incentive fees earned on our private equity funds only when it is probable that a clawback will not occur. 
 Corporate segment net revenue consists primarily of investment gains and losses on the Company s investments to seed strategies in our Asset Management business, net of hedging activities, and principal investments in private equity funds, as well as gains and losses on investments held in connection with Lazard Fund Interests LFI and interest income and interest expense. Corporate net revenue can fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of debt and equity securities, as well as due to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and the levels of cash, investments and indebtedness. 
 Corporate segment total assets represented 49 of Lazard s consolidated total assets as of September 30, 2024, which are attributable to cash and cash equivalents, investments in debt and equity securities, interests in alternative investment, debt, equity and private equity funds. 
 Operating Expenses 
 The majority of Lazard s operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits for managing directors and employees. Our compensation and benefits expense includes (i) salaries and benefits, (ii) amortization of the relevant portion of previously granted deferred incentive compensation awards, including (a) share-based incentive compensation under Lazard s 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended (the 2018 Plan and (b) LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements (see Note 13 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) a provision for discretionary or guaranteed cash bonuses and profit pools and (iv) when applicable, severance payments and cash retention awards. Compensation expense in any given period is dependent on many factors, including general economic and market conditions, our actual and forecasted operating and financial performance, staffing levels, estimated forfeiture rates, 
 47 

competitive pay conditions and the nature of revenues earned, as well as the mix between current and deferred compensation. 
 We use adjusted compensation and benefits expense and the ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenue, both non-GAAP measures, for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between periods. For the reconciliations and calculations with respect to adjusted compensation and benefits expense and related ratios to adjusted net revenue, see the table under Consolidated Results of Operations below. 
 Compensation and benefits expense is the largest component of our operating expenses. We seek to maintain discipline with respect to compensation, including the rate at which we award deferred compensation. We focus on a ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenue to manage costs, balancing a view of current conditions in the market for talent alongside our objective to drive long-term shareholder value. Our goal remains to deliver a ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenue over the cycle in the mid-to high-50s percentage range, while targeting a consistent deferral policy. While we have implemented policies and initiatives that we believe will assist us in delivering ratios within this range, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to deliver or maintain such ratios, or that our policies or initiatives will not change, in the future. Our practice is to pay our employees competitively to foster retention and motivate performance and, in doing so, we look to the market for talent and other factors, which are typically correlated with industry revenues, but may vary year by year. At the same time, the amount of compensation we award in a particular year is, in part, deferred and amortized over the successive years. Increased competition for professionals, changes in the macroeconomic environment or the financial markets generally, lower adjusted net revenue resulting from, for example, a decrease in M A activity, our share of the M A market or our AUM levels, changes in the mix of revenues from our businesses, investments in our businesses or various other factors could prevent us from achieving this goal. 
 Our operating expenses also include non-compensation expense , which includes costs for occupancy and equipment, marketing and business development, technology and information services, professional services, fund administration and outsourced services, amortization and other acquisition-related costs and other expenses. Our occupancy costs represent a significant portion of our aggregate operating expenses and are subject to change from time to time, particularly as leases for real property expire and are renewed or replaced with new, long-term leases for the same or other real property. 
 We believe that adjusted non-compensation expense , a non-GAAP measure, when presented in conjunction with measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), provides a meaningful and useful basis for our investors to assess our operating results. For calculations with respect to adjusted non-compensation expense , see the table under Consolidated Results of Operations below. 
 Cost-Saving Initiatives 
 The Company conducted firm-wide cost-saving initiatives over the course of 2023, which were completed during the first quarter of 2024. See Note 15 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Lazard Group primarily operates in the U.S. as a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, Lazard Group s income pertaining to the limited liability company is not subject to U.S. federal income tax because taxes associated with such income represent obligations of its partners. Lazard Group, through its subsidiaries, is subject to state and local taxes on its income apportioned to various state and local jurisdictions. Lazard Group operates principally through subsidiary corporations including through those domiciled outside the U.S. that are subject to local income taxes in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, Lazard Group is subject to Unincorporated Business Tax UBT attributable to its operations apportioned to New York City. 
 Additionally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the OECD reached agreement among various countries, including the EU member states, to establish a 15 minimum tax on certain multinational companies, commonly called Pillar Two . Many countries continue to announce changes in their tax laws and regulations to implement the OECD Pillar Two proposals. Lazard is continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two proposals, as new guidance becomes available. 
 48 

See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Income Taxes below and Note 16 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes and our deferred tax assets. 
 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 Noncontrolling interests primarily consist of (i) amounts related to Edgewater s management vehicles that the Company is deemed to control but not own, (ii) consolidated VIE interests held by employees and (iii) Lazard Growth Acquisition Corp. I LGAC interests. See Notes 12 and 20 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company s noncontrolling interests and consolidated VIEs. 
 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Lazard s condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars. Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries have a functional currency i.e ., the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted) that is other than the U.S. Dollar, generally the currency of the country in which the subsidiaries are domiciled. Such subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates as of the respective balance sheet date, while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the respective periods based on the daily closing exchange rates. Adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary s functional currency are reported as a component of members equity. Foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on transactions in non-functional currencies are included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Selected financial data derived from the Company s reported condensed consolidated results of operations is set forth below, followed by a more detailed discussion of both the consolidated and business segment results.

The tables below describe the components of adjusted net revenue, adjusted compensation and benefits expense, adjusted non-compensation expense, adjusted operating income and related key ratios, which are non-GAAP measures used by the Company to manage its business.

Operating Results 
 The Company s quarterly revenue and profits can fluctuate materially depending on the number, size and timing of completed transactions on which it advised, as well as seasonality, the performance of equity markets and other factors. Accordingly, the revenue and profits in any particular quarter may not be indicative of future results. Lazard management believes that annual results are the most meaningful basis for comparison among present, historical and future periods. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus September 30, 2023 
 The Company reported net income attributable to Lazard Group of 114 million, as compared to net income attributable to Lazard Group of 28 million in the 2023 period.

 Business Segments 
 The following is a discussion of net revenue and operating income (loss) for the Company s segments: Financial Advisory, Asset Management and Corporate. See Note 19 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding segments. 
 
 Financial Advisory 
 The following table summarizes the reported operating results attributable to the Financial Advisory segment:

The geographical distribution of Financial Advisory net revenue is set forth below in percentage terms and is based on the Lazard offices that generate Financial Advisory net revenue, which are located in the Americas (primarily in the U.S.), EMEA (primarily in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and the Asia Pacific region and therefore may not be reflective of the geography in which the clients are located. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Americas 58 59 60 56 EMEA 41 38 39 43 Asia Pacific 1 3 1 1 Total 100 100 100 100 
 The Company s managing directors and many of its professionals have significant experience, and many of them are able to use this experience to advise on a combination of M A, restructuring and other strategic advisory matters, depending on clients needs. This adaptability enables Lazard to more effectively deploy its professionals to best advantage based on the often counter-cyclical nature of restructuring as compared to our M A business. While Lazard measures revenue by practice area, Lazard does not separately measure the costs or profitability of M A services as compared to restructuring or other services. Accordingly, Lazard measures performance in its Financial Advisory segment based on overall segment adjusted net revenue and operating income margins. 
 
 Financial Advisory Results of Operations 
 Financial Advisory s quarterly revenue and profits can fluctuate materially depending on the number, size and timing of completed transactions on which it advised, as well as seasonality and other factors. Accordingly, the revenue and profits in any particular quarter or period may not be indicative of future results. Lazard management believes that annual results are the most meaningful basis for comparison among present, historical and future periods. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus September 30, 2023 
 Financial Advisory net revenue increased 105 million, or 39 , as compared to the 2023 period, primarily driven by an increased number of completed M A transactions with values greater than 500 million as compared to the 2023 period. 
 Operating expenses increased 39 million, or 13 , as compared to the 2023 period primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense associated with increased adjusted net revenue. 
 Financial Advisory operating income was 37 million as compared to an operating loss of 29 million in the 2023 period and, as a percentage of net revenue, was 10.0 , as compared to (10.8) in the 2023 period. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus September 30, 2023 
 
 Financial Advisory net revenue increased 341 million, or 38 , as compared to the 2023 period. The increase in Financial Advisory net revenue was primarily driven by an increased number of completed M A transactions with values greater than 500 million as compared to the 2023 period. 
 Operating expenses increased 75 million, or 7 , as compared to the 2023 period primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expense associated with increased adjusted net revenue. In addition, operating expenses in the 2024 and 2023 periods include 33 million and 88 million, respectively, associated with the cost-saving initiatives. 
 Financial Advisory operating income was 104 million as compared to an operating loss of 162 million in the 2023 period and, as a percentage of net revenue, was 8.4 , as compared to (18.1) in the 2023 period.

Asset Management 
 Assets Under Management 
 AUM primarily consists of debt and equity instruments, which have a value that is readily available based on either prices quoted on a recognized exchange or prices provided by external pricing services. 
 Prices of equity and debt securities and other instruments that comprise our AUM are provided by well-recognized, independent, third-party vendors. Such third-party vendors rely on prices provided by external pricing services which are obtained from recognized exchanges or markets, or, for certain fixed income securities, from evaluated bids or other similarly sourced price. 
 Either directly, or through our third-party vendors, we perform a variety of regular due diligence procedures on our pricing service providers. 
 The following table shows the composition of AUM for the Asset Management segment (see Item 1, Business Principal Business Lines Asset Management Investment Strategies ): 
 As of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 in millions) AUM by Asset Class: Equity: Emerging Markets 29,449 25,288 Global 50,441 53,528 Local 54,380 52,208 Multi-Regional 57,262 59,114 Total Equity 191,532 190,138 Fixed Income: Emerging Markets 8,372 9,525 Global 12,474 10,762 Local 5,931 6,080 Multi-Regional 21,156 21,740 Total Fixed Income 47,933 48,107 Alternative Investments 3,011 3,330 Private Wealth Alternative Investments 3,044 2,799 Private Equity 1,514 1,623 Cash Management 623 654 Total AUM 247,657 246,651 
 Total AUM at September 30, 2024 was 248 billion, an increase of 1 billion as compared to total AUM of 247 billion at December 31, 2023 due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Average AUM for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 increased 4 as compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2023 and increased 6 as compared to the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 83 of our AUM was managed on behalf of institutional and intermediary clients, including corporations, labor unions, public pension funds, insurance companies and banks, and through sub-advisory relationships, mutual fund sponsors, broker-dealers and registered advisors, compared to 85 as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 17 of our AUM was managed on behalf of individual client relationships, compared to approximately 15 as of December 31, 2023. 
 56 

As of September 30, 2024, AUM with foreign currency exposure represented approximately 62 of our total AUM as compared to 64 at December 31, 2023. AUM with foreign currency exposure generally declines in value with the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar and increases in value as the U.S. Dollar weakens, with all other factors held constant. 
 The following is a summary of changes in AUM by asset class for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Cash Flows 
 The Company s cash flows are influenced primarily by the timing of the receipt of Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, the timing of distributions to members, payments of incentive compensation to managing directors and employees and purchases of common stock. 
 M A and other advisory and Asset Management fees are generally collected within 60 days of billing, while Restructuring fee collections may extend beyond 60 days, particularly those that involve bankruptcies with court-ordered 
 60 

holdbacks. Fees from our Private Capital Advisory activities are generally collected over a four-year period from billing and typically include an interest component. 
 The Company makes cash payments for a significant portion of its incentive compensation with respect to the prior year s results during the first three months of each calendar year. See the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further detail.

 (d) Consists of cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and short-term investments and restricted cash. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 Net revenue, operating income and cash receipts fluctuate significantly between periods and could be affected by various risks and uncertainties. While cash flow from Asset Management activities is relatively stable, in the case of Financial Advisory, fee receipts are generally dependent upon the successful completion of client transactions, the occurrence and timing of which is irregular and not subject to Lazard s control. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed the sale of an owned office building for gross proceeds of approximately 194 million, subject to payment of taxes and other expenses. The resulting net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Liquidity is significantly impacted by cash payments for incentive compensation, a significant portion of which are made during the first three months of the year. As a consequence, cash on hand generally declines in the beginning of the year and gradually builds over the remainder of the year. We also make payments during the year on behalf of certain managing directors for their estimated taxes, which serve to reduce their respective incentive compensation payments. 
 61 

Additionally, we made payments through the third quarter of 2024 relating to severance and other employee termination costs associated with the cost-saving initiatives. (See Note 15 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Also see Senior Debt below for senior debt refinancing in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Liquidity is also affected by the level of LFB customer-related demand deposits, primarily from clients and funds managed by LFG. To the extent that such deposits rise or fall, and assuming unchanged asset allocation, this has a corresponding impact on liquidity held at LFB, with the majority of such amounts generally being recorded in deposits with banks and short-term investments . LFB is subject to, and in compliance with, regulatory liquidity coverage ratios and liquidity levels are monitored on a daily basis. 
 We regularly monitor our liquidity position, including cash levels, lease obligations, investments, credit lines, principal investment commitments, interest and principal payments on debt, capital expenditures, distributions to members, purchases of shares of common stock, compensation and matters relating to liquidity and to compliance with regulatory net capital requirements. At September 30, 2024, Lazard had approximately 1,161 million of cash and cash equivalents, including approximately 599 million held at Lazard s operations outside the U.S. Lazard provides for income taxes on substantially all of its foreign earnings and we expect that no material amount of additional taxes would be recognized upon receipt of dividends or distributions of such earnings from our foreign operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s remaining lease obligations were 21 million for 2024 (October 1 through December 31), 144 million from 2025 through 2026, 143 million from 2027 through 2028 and 332 million from 2029 through 2039. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Lazard had approximately 210 million in unused lines of credit available to it, including a 200 million, five-year, senior revolving credit facility under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 
 The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including limitations on consolidations, mergers, indebtedness and certain payments, as well as financial condition covenants relating to leverage and interest coverage ratios. Lazard Group s obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest, breaches of covenants, cross-defaults to other material debt, a change in control and specified bankruptcy events. Borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement generally will bear interest at adjusted term SOFR plus an applicable margin for specific interest periods determined based on Lazard Group s highest credit rating from an internationally recognized credit agency. 
 The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes financial covenants that require that Lazard Group not permit (i) its Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the 12-month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00, provided that the Consolidated Leverage Ratio may be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 for four (consecutive or nonconsecutive) quarters so long as it is not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 on the last day of any such quarter, or (ii) its Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) for the 12-month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00. No amounts were outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 
 In addition, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain other covenants (none of which relate to financial condition), events of default and other customary provisions. At September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial and nonfinancial provisions. 
 Lazard s annual cash flow generated from operations historically has been sufficient to enable it to meet its annual obligations. We believe that the sources of liquidity described above should be sufficient for us to fund our current obligations for the next 12 months.

 In the first quarter of 2024, the Company issued 400 million of 6.0 senior notes due March 2031 to refinance the upcoming maturity of our 2025 Notes. We used part of the net proceeds to purchase in a tender offer 236 million of the 2025 Notes 164 million remains outstanding). We invested the net proceeds in U.S. Treasury securities which are included in cash and cash equivalents and investments on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of September 30, 2024. On October 30, 2024, the Company announced that it will redeem all of the issued and outstanding 2025 Notes on December 12, 2024. 
 The indenture and supplemental indentures relating to Lazard Group s senior notes contain certain covenants (none of which relate to financial condition), events of default and other customary provisions. At September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of these provisions. We may, to the extent required and subject to restrictions contained in our financing arrangements, use other financing sources, which may cause us to be subject to additional restrictions or covenants. 
 See Note 10 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding senior debt.

Members Equity 
 At September 30, 2024, total members equity was 356 million, as compared to 182 million at December 31, 2023, including 305 million and 136 million attributable to Lazard Group on the respective dates. The net activity in members equity during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 is reflected in the table below (in millions of dollars): 
 Members Equity - January 1, 2024 182 Increase (decrease) due to: Net income (a) 204 Other comprehensive income 18 Amortization of share-based incentive compensation 235 Purchase of common stock (44) Settlement of share-based incentive compensation (b) (64) Distributions to members and noncontrolling interests (169) Other - net (6) Members Equity - September 30, 2024 356 
 ________________________________________ 
 
 (a) Excludes net income associated with redeemable noncontrolling interests of 9 million in 2024. 
 (b) The tax withholding portion of share-based compensation is settled in cash, not shares. 
 See the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Statements of Changes in Members Equity and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests for further detail. 
 The Board of Directors of Lazard has issued a series of authorizations to repurchase common stock, which help offset the dilutive effect of our share-based incentive compensation plans. The Company aims to repurchase shares to offset dilution from the shares it expects to issue pursuant to such compensation plans in respect of year-end incentive compensation over time. The rate at which the Company purchases shares in connection with this annual objective may vary from period to period due to a variety of factors. Purchases with respect to such program are set forth in the table below: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30: Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Per Share 2023 2,782,662 36.67 2024 1,123,413 39.10 
 As of September 30, 2024, a total of 356 million of share repurchase authorization remained available under Lazard, Inc. s share repurchase program, of which 156 million will expire on December 31, 2024 and 200 million will expire on December 31, 2026. 
 During the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, Lazard, Inc. had in place trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), pursuant to which it effected stock repurchases in the open market. 
 See Notes 12 and 13 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Lazard s members equity and incentive plans, respectively. 
 
 Regulatory Capital 
 We actively monitor our regulatory capital base. Our principal subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements in their respective jurisdictions to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity, which require, among other things, that we comply with rules regarding certain minimum capital requirements. These regulatory requirements may restrict the flow of funds to and from affiliates. See Note 18 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. These regulations differ in the U.S., the U.K., France and other countries in which we operate. Our capital 
 64 

structure is designed to provide each of our subsidiaries with capital and liquidity consistent with its business and regulatory requirements. For a discussion of regulations relating to us, see Item 1, Business Regulation included in our Form 10-K. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of Lazard s condensed consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, Lazard evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, the allowance for credit losses, compensation liabilities, income taxes and goodwill. Lazard bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments, including judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities, that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 The following is a description of Lazard s critical accounting estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Lazard generates substantially all of its revenue from providing Financial Advisory and Asset Management services to clients. Lazard recognizes revenue in accordance with the criteria in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Form 10-K. 
 Assessment of these criteria requires the application of judgment in determining the timing and amount of revenue recognized, including the probability of collection of fees. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 We maintain an allowance for credit losses to provide coverage for estimated losses from our receivables. We determine the adequacy of the allowance under the current expected credit losses CECL guidance by (i) applying a charge-off rate based on historical credit loss experience; (ii) estimating the probability of loss based on our analysis of the client s creditworthiness resulting in specific reserves against exposures where we determine the receivables are uncollectible, which may include situations where a fee is in dispute or litigation has commenced; and (iii) performing qualitative assessments to monitor economic risks that may require additional adjustments. 
 The allowance for credit losses involves judgment including the incorporation of historical loss experience and assessment of risk characteristics of our clients. The charge-off rate based on historical credit loss experience was an average annual rate estimated using the most recent two years of charge-off data. When assessing risk characteristics of individual clients, we considered the macroeconomic environment in the local market, our collection experience and recent communication with the client, as well as any potential future engagement with the client. 
 Compensation Liabilities 
 Annual discretionary compensation represents a significant portion of our annual compensation and benefits expense. We allocate the estimated amount of such annual discretionary compensation to interim periods in proportion to the amount of adjusted net revenue earned in such periods based on an estimated annual ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenue. See Financial Statement Overview Operating Expenses for more information on our periodic compensation and benefits expense. 
 Income Taxes 
 As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes for each of our tax-paying entities in its respective jurisdiction. In addition to estimating actual current tax liabilities for these jurisdictions, we also must account for the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting of items, such as basis adjustments, compensation and benefits expense, and depreciation and amortization. Differences which are temporary in nature result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Significant judgment is required in determining our 
 65 

provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets and our unrecognized tax benefits. 
 We recognize a deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of greater than 50 that a tax benefit will be accepted by the relevant taxing authority. The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon currently enacted tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions. 
 Subsequent to the initial recognition of deferred tax assets, we also must continually assess the likelihood that such deferred tax assets will be realized. If we determine that we may not fully derive the benefit from a deferred tax asset, we consider whether it would be appropriate to apply a valuation allowance against the applicable deferred tax asset, taking into account all available information. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset for a particular entity depends, among other things, on the generation of taxable income by such entity in the applicable jurisdiction. 
 We consider multiple possible sources of taxable income when assessing a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Form 10-K for additional information on sources of taxable income, and the information considered when assessing whether a valuation allowance is required. 
 The weight we give to any particular item is, in part, dependent upon the degree to which it can be objectively verified. We give greater weight to the recent results of operations of a relevant entity. Pre-tax operating losses on a three year cumulative basis or lack of sustainable profitability are considered objectively verifiable evidence and will generally outweigh a projection of future taxable income. 
 Certain of our tax-paying entities have individually experienced losses on a cumulative three year basis or have tax attributes that may expire unused. In addition, some of our tax-paying entities have recorded a valuation allowance on substantially all of their deferred tax assets due to the combined effect of operating losses in certain subsidiaries of these entities as well as foreign taxes that together substantially offset any U.S. tax liability. Taking into account all available information, we cannot determine that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets held by these entities will be realized. Consequently, we have recorded valuation allowances on deferred tax assets held by these entities as of December 31, 2023. 
 We record tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based upon our estimates regarding the amount that is more likely than not to be realized or paid, including in connection with the resolution of any related appeals or other legal processes. Accordingly, we recognize liabilities for certain unrecognized tax benefits based on the amounts that are more likely than not to be settled with the relevant taxing authority. Such liabilities are evaluated periodically as new information becomes available and any changes in the amounts of such liabilities are recorded as adjustments to income tax expense . Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits involve significant judgment and the ultimate resolution of such matters may be materially different from our estimates. 
 In addition to the discussion above regarding deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowances, as well as unrecognized tax benefit liability estimates, other factors affect our provision for income taxes, including changes in the geographic mix of our business, the level of our annual pre-tax income, transfer pricing and intercompany transactions. 
 See Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Form 10-K and Note 16 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to income taxes. 
 Goodwill 
 Goodwill has an indefinite life and is tested for impairment annually, as of November 1, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company performs a qualitative assessment about whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in lieu of actually calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. The qualitative assessment includes significant judgment on the business outlook assumptions of each reporting unit based on historical data, current economic conditions, stock performance and industry trends. If events indicate that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value, the Company performs a quantitative assessment to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compares it to its carrying values. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company would recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess. The goodwill impairment tests indicated no reporting units were at risk of impairment. See Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding goodwill. 
 66 

Consolidation 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements include entities in which Lazard has a controlling financial interest. Lazard determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity VOE or a variable interest entity VIE under U.S. GAAP. 
 Voting Interest Entities. VOEs are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and (ii) the equity holders have the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity s activities. Lazard is required to consolidate a VOE if it holds a majority of the voting interest in such VOE. 
 Variable Interest Entities. VIEs are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a VOE. If Lazard has a variable interest, or a combination of variable interests, in a VIE, it is required to analyze whether it needs to consolidate such VIE. Lazard is required to consolidate a VIE if we are the primary beneficiary having (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of, or receive benefits from, the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE. 
 Lazard s involvement with various entities that are VOEs or VIEs primarily arises from LFI investments, seed and other investments in our Asset Management business. Lazard consolidates these entities when it has a controlling financial interest. 
 The impact of seed and LFI investment entities that require consolidation on the condensed consolidated financial statements, including any consolidation or deconsolidation of such entities, is not material to our financial statements. Our exposure to loss from entities in which we have made such investments is limited to the extent of our investment in, or investment commitment to, such entities. 
 Generally, when the Company initially invests to seed an investment entity, the Company is the majority owner of the entity. Our majority ownership in seed investment entities represents a controlling financial interest, except when we are the general partner in such entities and the third-party investors have the right to replace the general partner. To the extent material, we consolidate seed and LFI investment entities in which we own a controlling financial interest, and we would deconsolidate any such entity when we no longer have a controlling financial interest in such entity. 
 Seed investments held in entities in which the Company maintained a controlling financial interest were 115 million in ten entities as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 114 million in eleven entities as of December 31, 2023. LFI investments held in entities in which the Company maintained a controlling financial interest were 98 million in nine entities as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 144 million in nine entities as of December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not consolidate any seed investment entities or LFI investment entities, with the exception of the consolidation of certain LFI funds (see Note 20 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). As such, seed investments and substantially all of LFI investments included in investments on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition represented the Company s economic interest in the seed and LFI investments. 
 
 Risk Management 
 Investments 
 Investments consist primarily of debt and equity securities, and interests in alternative investment, debt, equity and private equity funds. These investments are carried at fair value on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition, and any increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments are reflected in earnings. The fair value of investments is generally based upon market prices or the net asset value NAV or its equivalent for investments in funds. 
 Investments also include those investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Any increases or decreases in the Company s share of net income or losses pertaining to its equity method investments are reflected in earnings. 
 See Note 6 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the measurement of the fair value of investments. 
 67 

Lazard is subject to market and other risks on investments held. As such, gains and losses on investment positions held, which arise from sales or changes in the fair value of the investments, are not predictable and can cause periodic fluctuations in net income. 
 Data relating to investments is set forth below: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 in thousands) Seed investments by asset class: Debt 1,429 4,285 Equity (a) 123,703 112,807 Fixed income 16,985 15,860 Alternative investments 34,514 33,073 Private equity 17,815 19,361 Total seed investments 194,446 185,386 Other investments owned: Private equity 9,606 10,963 U.S. Treasury securities 49,673 Fixed income and other 2,372 2,119 Total other investments owned 61,651 13,082 Subtotal 256,097 198,468 Private equity consolidated, not owned 18,936 16,494 Equity method 17,937 LFI 395,441 487,002 Total investments 688,411 701,964 
 _______________________ 
 
 (a) At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, seed investments in directly owned equity securities were invested as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Percentage invested in: Financials 16 14 Consumer 32 32 Industrial 14 15 Technology 21 20 Other 17 19 Total 100 100 
 The Company makes investments primarily to seed strategies in our Asset Management business or to reduce exposure arising from LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements. The Company manages its net economic exposure to market and other risks arising from seed investments and other investments owned. The Company does not hedge investments associated with LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, or investments in funds owned entirely by the noncontrolling interest holders as there is no net economic exposure. 
 The market risk associated with investments held in connection with LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements is equally offset by the market risk associated with the derivative liability with respect to awards expected to vest. The Company is subject to market risk associated with any portion of such investments that employees may forfeit. See Risk Management Risks Related to Derivatives for risk management information relating to derivatives. 
 68 

Risk sensitivities include the effects of economic hedging. For equity market price risk, investment portfolios and their corresponding hedges are beta-adjusted to the All-Country World equity index. Interest rate and credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk are hedged using relevant benchmark indices. Private equity risk is not hedged due to lack of proxy hedging instruments. Fair value and sensitivity measurements presented herein are based on various portfolio exposures at a particular point in time and may not be representative of future results. Risk exposures may change as a result of ongoing portfolio activities and changing market conditions, among other things. 
 Equity Market Price Risk At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s exposure to equity market price risk in its investment portfolio, which primarily relates to investments in equity securities, equity funds and hedge funds, was approximately 163 million and 150 million, respectively. The Company hedges market exposure arising from a significant portion of our equity investment portfolios by entering into total return swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10 adverse change in market prices would not result in a net change in the carrying value of such investments as of September 30, 2024 and would result in a net increase of approximately 0.2 million as of December 31, 2023, in the carrying value of such investments, including the effect of the hedging transactions. 
 Interest Rate and Credit Spread Risk At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s exposure to interest rate and credit spread risk in its investment portfolio related to investments in debt securities or funds which invest primarily in debt securities was 70 million and 18 million, respectively. The Company hedges market exposure arising from a portion of our debt investment portfolios by entering into total return swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates or credit spreads would result in a net decrease of approximately 0.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and would not result in a net change in the carrying value of such investments as of December 31, 2023 including the effect of the hedging transactions. 
 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk in its investment portfolio, which primarily relates to investments in foreign currency denominated equity and debt securities and, at December 31, 2023, private equity investments, was 66 million and 69 million, respectively. A significant portion of the Company s foreign currency exposure related to our equity and debt investment portfolios is hedged through the aforementioned total return swaps. The Company estimates that a 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar would result in a net decrease of approximately 1.6 million and 2.0 million in the carrying value of such investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, including the effect of the hedging transactions. 
 Private Equity The Company invests in private equity primarily as a part of its co-investment activities and in connection with certain legacy businesses. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s exposure to changes in fair value of such investments was approximately 27 million and 30 million, respectively. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10 adverse change in fair value would result in a decrease of approximately 2.7 million and 3.0 million in the carrying value of such investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 For additional information regarding risks associated with our investments, see Item 1A, Risk Factors Other Business Risks Our results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the fair value of positions held in our investment portfolios in our Form 10-K. 
 Risks Related to Receivables 
 We maintain an allowance for credit losses to provide coverage for expected losses from our receivables. At September 30, 2024, total receivables amounted to 766 million, net of an allowance for credit losses of 27 million. As of that date, Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, receivables from Lazard, Inc. subsidiaries and customers and other receivables comprised 69 , 11 and 20 of total receivables, respectively. At December 31, 2023, total receivables amounted to 845 million, net of an allowance for credit losses of 29 million. As of that date, Financial Advisory and Asset Management fees, receivables from Lazard, Inc. subsidiaries and customers and other receivables comprised 66 , 10 and 24 of total receivables, respectively. See also Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition above and Note 4 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding receivables. 
 LFG and LFB offer wealth management and banking services to high net worth individuals and families. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, customers and other receivables included 93 million and 86 million, respectively, of such LFB loans which are fully collateralized and monitored for counterparty creditworthiness, with such 
 69 

collateral having a fair value in excess of the carrying amount of the loans. Therefore, there was no allowance for credit losses required at those dates related to such receivables. 
 Credit Concentrations 
 The Company monitors its exposures to individual counterparties and diversifies where appropriate to reduce the exposure to concentrations of credit. 
 Risks Related to Derivatives 
 Lazard enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge exposures to currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses total return swap contracts on various equity and debt indices to hedge a portion of its market exposure with respect to certain investments that seed strategies in our Asset Management business. Derivative contracts are recorded at fair value. In entering into derivative agreements, the Company is subject to counterparty risk. Net derivative assets amounted to 2 million and 3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and net derivative liabilities, excluding the derivative liability arising from the Company s obligation pertaining to LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements amounted to 8 million and 3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Company also records derivative liabilities relating to its obligations pertaining to LFI awards and other similar deferred compensation arrangements, the fair value of which is based on the value of the underlying investments, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities are equally offset by the changes in the fair value of investments which are expected to be delivered upon settlement of LFI awards. Derivative liabilities relating to LFI amounted to 285 million and 365 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Risks Related to Cash and Cash Equivalents and Corporate Indebtedness 
 A significant portion of the Company s indebtedness has fixed interest rates, while its cash and cash equivalents generally have market interest rates. Based on account balances as of September 30, 2024, Lazard estimates that its annual operating income relating to cash and cash equivalents would increase by approximately 12 million in the event interest rates were to increase by 1 and decrease by approximately 12 million if rates were to decrease by 1 . 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately 1,161 million. Substantially all of the Company s cash and cash equivalents were invested in (i) highly liquid institutional money market funds (a significant majority of which were invested solely in U.S. Government or agency money market funds), (ii) in short-term interest bearing and non-interest bearing accounts at a number of leading banks throughout the world, (iii) in short-term certificates of deposit from such banks and (iv) short-term U.S. Treasury securities. Cash and cash equivalents are continuously monitored. On a regular basis, management reviews its investment profile as well as the credit profile of its list of depositor banks in order to adjust any deposit or investment thresholds as necessary. 
 
 Operational Risk 
 Operational risk is inherent in all of our businesses and may, for example, manifest itself in the form of errors, breaches in the system of internal controls, employee misconduct, business interruptions, fraud, including fraud perpetrated by third parties, legal actions due to operating deficiencies, noncompliance or cyber attacks. The Company maintains a framework including policies and a system of internal controls designed to monitor and manage operational risk and provide management with timely and accurate information. Management within each of our operating subsidiaries is primarily responsible for its operational risk programs. The Company has in place business continuity and disaster recovery programs that manage its capabilities to provide services in the case of a disruption. We purchase insurance policies designed to help protect the Company against accidental loss and losses that may significantly affect our financial objectives, personnel, property or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups. See Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for more information regarding operational risk in our business and Item 1C, Cybersecurity in our Form 10-K for more information on the Company s processes to identify, assess and manage cybersecurity risks.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Risk Management 
 Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included under the caption Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management . 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 In addition, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is involved from time to time in judicial, governmental, regulatory and arbitration proceedings and inquiries concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our businesses, including proceedings initiated by former employees alleging wrongful termination. The Company reviews such matters on a case-by-case basis and establishes any required accrual if a loss is probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company may experience significant variation in its revenue and earnings on a quarterly basis. Accordingly, the results of any pending matter or matters could be significant when compared to the Company s earnings in any particular quarter. The Company believes, however, based on currently available information, that the results of any pending matters, in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on its business or financial condition.
