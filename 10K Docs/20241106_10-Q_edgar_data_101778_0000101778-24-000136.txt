 2024 Our effective income tax rate was different from our U.S. statutory tax rate of 21 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a deferred tax valuation allowance recorded in the quarter against foreign tax credits expiring in future periods. As a result of continued volatility in commodity prices and corresponding impacts to projections of future taxable income, we believe it is more likely than not that we will not utilize million of foreign tax credits before they expire. We continue to assess whether the balance of the valuation allowance is appropriate on a quarterly basis particularly given the expiring nature of foreign tax credits in years 2025 through 2026. If we experience sustained lower commodity prices that impact the performance of future earnings, it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months sufficient negative evidence may exist that will require us to establish additional valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets that we do not expect to realize. 
 In August 2022, the President signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA into law. The IRA enacted various income tax provisions, including a 15 corporate book minimum tax. The corporate book minimum tax, which became effective on January 1, 2023, applies to corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income that exceeds 1 billion for the preceding three years. Under current law and guidance, we are subject to the corporate book minimum tax in 2024. In September 2024, the IRS issued proposed regulations on the corporate book minimum tax. We have reviewed the proposed regulations and do not expect any material changes to our calculation for 2024. In addition, in September 2024, estimated tax payment relief for the 2024 corporate book minimum tax was granted through the end of the year. As further guidance is issued, we will continue to evaluate and assess the impact the IRA may have on our current and future period income taxes.

 Commodity Derivatives 
 We have entered into crude oil and natural gas derivatives indexed to their respective indices as noted in the table below, related to a portion of our forecasted U.S. sales through 2025. These derivatives are three-way collars and two-way collars. Three-way collars consist of a sold call (ceiling), a purchased put (floor) and a sold put. The ceiling price is the maximum we will receive for the contract volumes; the floor is the minimum price we will receive, unless the market price falls below the sold put strike price. In this case, we receive the NYMEX WTI price plus the difference between the floor and the sold put price. Two-way collars only consists of a sold call (ceiling) and a purchased put (floor). These crude oil and natural gas derivatives were not designated as hedges.

 As of September 30, 2024, our commodity derivatives include three-way collars and two-way collars. These instruments are measured at fair value using either a Black-Scholes or a modified Black-Scholes Model. For three-way collars and two-way collars, inputs to the models include commodity prices and implied volatility and are categorized as Level 2 because predominantly all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments. 
 The forward starting interest rate swaps are measured at fair value with a market approach using actionable broker quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 8 for details on the forward starting interest rate swaps. 
 Fair Values Financial Instruments 
 Our current assets and liabilities include financial instruments, the most significant of which are receivables, commercial paper borrowings, the current portion of our long-term debt and payables. We believe the carrying values of our receivables, commercial paper borrowings and payables approximate fair value. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including (1) the short-term duration of the instruments, (2) our credit rating and (3) our historical incurrence of and expected future insignificant bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk.

 Fair values of our financial assets included in other noncurrent assets, and of our financial liabilities included in other current liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities, are measured using an income approach and most inputs are internally generated, which results in a Level 3 classification. Estimated future cash flows are discounted using a rate deemed appropriate to obtain the fair value. 
 Our fixed rate debt instruments are publicly traded. The fair value of our fixed rate debt is measured using a market approach, based upon quotes from major financial institutions, which are Level 2 inputs. Our floating rate debt is non-public and consists of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. The fair value of our floating rate debt approximates the carrying value and is estimated based on observable market-based inputs, which results in a Level 2 classification.

 In accordance with the Merger Agreement, each outstanding and vested Marathon Oil option award granted pursuant to the Marathon Oil stock plan will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a number of shares of ConocoPhillips common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of (i) the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration Value (as defined below) over the per share exercise price, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Marathon Oil common stock subject to such Marathon Oil option award immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (ii) the volume-weighted average price of the ConocoPhillips common stock for the five consecutive trading days ending two trading days prior to the closing date (the Parent Closing Price ). Any Marathon Oil option award that has an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration Value will be canceled for no consideration. The term Merger Consideration Value means the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by (y) the Parent Closing Price. 
 At closing, restricted stock units will be canceled and converted into an award of ConocoPhillips common stock at the Exchange Ratio and will be subject to the same vesting conditions that existed prior to the closing of the Merger Agreement. Any restricted stock units held by non-employee directors of Marathon Oil will fully vest at closing and be converted, at the Exchange Ratio, into the right to receive ConocoPhillips common stock. Additionally, consummation of the Merger constitutes a change in control as defined under our 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan. After a change in control has occurred, restricted stock units granted to employees who are involuntarily separated, under certain conditions, will immediately vest as ConocoPhillips common stock. 
 Stock-based performance unit awards 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we granted stock-based performance units to eligible officers, which are settled in shares. The weighted average grant date fair value per unit was . During the first nine months of 2024, we stock settled the units related to the 2021 grant. At September 30, 2024, there were outstanding stock-based performance units to be settled in shares to officers. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we also granted stock-based performance units to eligible officers, which are settled in cash. At the grant date for these performance units, each unit represents the value of share of our common stock. The fair value of each cash-settled performance unit was as of September 30, 2024. During the first nine months of 2024, we also cash settled the units related to the 2022 grant. At September 30, 2024, there were units outstanding of the stock-based performance unit awards to be settled in cash to officers. 
 In accordance with the Merger Agreement, each stock-based performance unit that is outstanding immediately prior to closing will vest. Outstanding performance units were initially granted assuming a target payout; however, at closing, all outstanding performance units will vest at the maximum payout percentage of of target.

 Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation (the Affiliated Tribes represented by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (the BIA ), have been involved in a dispute regarding the ownership of certain lands underlying the Missouri River and Little Missouri River (the Disputed Land from which we currently produce. As a result, as of September 30, 2024, we have a million current liability in suspended royalty and working interest revenue, including interest, of which million was included within accounts payable and million related to accrued interest was included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we have a long-term receivable of million for capital and expenses. The United States Department of the Interior DOI has addressed the United States position with respect to this dispute several times in recent years with conflicting opinions. In January 2017, the DOI issued an opinion that the Disputed Land is held in trust for the Affiliated Tribes, then in June 2018 and May 2020 the DOI issued opinions concluding that the State of North Dakota held title to the Disputed Land. Most recently, on February 4, 2022, the DOI issued an opinion M-Opinion concluding that the Disputed Land is held in trust for the Affiliated Tribes. While the M-Opinion is binding on all agencies within the DOI, it is not legally binding on third parties, including Marathon Oil, the State of North Dakota, or a court. Given the uncertainty in matters such as these, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter at this time; however, we believe the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we may also be subject to retained liabilities with respect to certain divested assets by operation of law. For example, we are exposed to the risk that owners and/or operators of assets purchased from us become unable to satisfy plugging or abandonment obligations that attach to those assets. In that event, due to operation of law, we may be required to assume plugging or abandonment obligations for those assets. Although we have established reserves for such liabilities, we could be required to accrue additional amounts in the future and these amounts could be material.

million civil penalty, with substantially all of that civil penalty accrued in our quarterly report for the period ending March 31, 2024. In October 2024, we paid the million civil penalty in full. In 2022, we began early implementation of the injunctive requirements, which are scheduled to be completed in 2025 for a total cost of approximately million, over of which has been incurred or included in the 2024 capital budget with the remaining amount to be spent by the end of 2025. The consent decree contains a detailed compliance schedule with deadlines for achievement of milestones through at least 2026 and requirements for ongoing permitting, inspection and monitoring, maintenance, auditing, and reporting. We do not admit liability regarding any of the allegations in the complaint associated with the consent decree and elected to resolve the allegations in a negotiated settlement rather than litigation. 
 We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices we receive for our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. 
 At September 30, 2024, accrued liabilities for remediation relating to environmental laws and regulations were not material. It is not presently possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation costs that might be incurred or the penalties that may be imposed. 
 In the second quarter of 2019, Marathon E.G. Production Limited MEGPL ), a consolidated and wholly owned subsidiary, signed a series of agreements to process third-party Alen Unit gas through existing infrastructure located in Punta Europa, E.G. Our equity method investee, Alba Plant LLC, is also a party to some of the agreements. These agreements require (subject to certain limitations) MEGPL to indemnify the owners of the Alen Unit against injury to Alba Plant LLC s personnel and damage to or loss of Alba Plant LLC s automobiles, as well as third party claims caused by Alba Plant LLC and certain environmental liabilities arising from certain hydrocarbons in the custody of Alba Plant LLC. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate this obligation as we do not have any history of prior indemnification claims or environmental discharge or contamination. Therefore, we have not recorded a liability with respect to these indemnities since the amount of potential future payments under these indemnification clauses is not determinable. 
 separate guarantees were executed during the second quarter of 2020; one for a maximum of approximately million pertaining to the payment obligations of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and another for a maximum of million pertaining to the payment obligations of Alba Plant LLC. Payment by us would be required if any of those entities fails to honor its payment obligations pursuant to the relevant agreements with the owners of the Alen Unit. Certain owners of the Alen Unit, or their affiliates, are also direct or indirect shareholders in Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Alba Plant LLC. Each guarantee expires no later than December 31, 2027. We measured these guarantees at fair value using the net present value of premium payments we expect to receive from our investees. Our liability for these guarantees was approximately million as of September 30, 2024. Each of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. and Equatorial Guinea LNG Train 1, S.A. provided us with a pledge of its receivables as recourse against any payments we may make under the guaranty of Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A. s performance.

 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the preceding consolidated financial statements and notes in Item 1 . 
 
 Executive Overview 
 We are an independent exploration and production company, focused on U.S. resource plays: Eagle Ford in Texas, Bakken in North Dakota, Permian in New Mexico and Texas and STACK and SCOOP in Oklahoma. Our U.S. assets are complemented by our international operations in E.G. As shown in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Vision and Mission are supported by our Foundation and Values. We expect to achieve our Vision by adherence to a capital allocation framework that limits our capital expenditures relative to our expected cash flow from operations. We allocate capital to prioritize shareholder returns and per share growth, exercise discipline in reinvestment, retire outstanding debt and replenish inventory. 
 Proposed Merger 
 On May 28, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement with ConocoPhillips and Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Marathon Oil, with Marathon Oil surviving and continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each of our outstanding shares of common stock (other than certain Excluded Shares and Converted Shares) will be converted to the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Merger Agreement also contains certain customary termination rights of each of Marathon Oil and ConocoPhillips, and under certain circumstances, a termination fee would be payable by us. 
 On July 11, 2024, Marathon Oil and ConocoPhillips each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (together, the Second Request from the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC in connection with the FTC s review of the Merger. Issuance of the Second Request extends the waiting period imposed by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended until 30 days after Marathon Oil and ConocoPhillips have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless that period is terminated sooner by the FTC. Marathon Oil and ConocoPhillips will continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the Merger. 
 On August 29, 2024, the Company s stockholders approved and adopted the Merger Agreement at a special meeting of stockholders. Completion of the Merger remains subject to certain conditions, including certain governmental and regulatory approvals. The Merger is currently expected to close late in the fourth quarter of 2024; however, no assurance can be given as to when, or if, the Merger will occur. 
 In association with the Merger, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have incurred transaction costs of 6 million and 16 million, respectively, which are recorded as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income. We expect to incur additional costs as the Merger progresses. Transaction costs consist primarily of third party legal and banking fees. 
 If the Merger is consummated, Marathon Oil s common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Marathon Oil will cease to be a publicly traded company.

 Additionally, the Merger Agreement imposes restrictions on our business and operations during the pendency of the Merger. While we do not believe those restrictions are unduly burdensome, they may delay or prevent us from taking actions we could otherwise take. Accordingly, our results of operations from before the Merger Agreement may not be comparable to results of operations since we entered into the Merger Agreement. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Merger and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to the Merger. 
 Financial and operational results 
 Our net income was 287 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to net income of 453 million in the same period last year. Included in our financial results for the current quarter: 
 Revenue from contracts with customers in our US segment decreased 85 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The primary drivers of the decrease were lower crude and natural gas price realizations, partially offset by increased crude sales volumes. 
 In our International segment we realized revenue of 72 million in the third quarter of 2024 from shipments of LNG with global pricing linkage that began in 2024. Refer to Operations below for additional information. 
 Received EG dividend distribution and return of capital totaling 29 million. 
 Shipping, and handling and other operating, including related party expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased by 40 million and 44 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in shipping, handling and other operating, including related party expense was driven primarily by EG LNG processing LNG for a tolling fee and profit share, and an increase in purchases of commodity volumes for resale to satisfy transportation commitments. The increase in DD A was driven by increased net sales volumes in our US segment during the quarter. 
 Provision for income taxes increased 52 million compared to the same quarter last year. The primary driver of the increase was a 75 million deferred tax valuation allowance recorded against foreign tax credits expiring in future periods, partially offset by lower income before income taxes. See C ritica l Accounting Estimates section below and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 We reduced our long-term debt and commercial paper outstanding. During the third quarter of 2024, we redeemed 400 million of bonds outstanding. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had 270 million in net repayments of commercial paper and as of September 30, 2024 , we have 180 million in remaining outstanding commercial paper borrowings . See Cash Flows section below and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 
 Outlook 
 Capital Budget 
 In February 2024, we announced a 2024 capital budget of 1.9 billion to 2.1 billion. The terms of the Merger Agreement restrict us from certain expansions to our capital budget. 
 Due to an increase in our production during the third quarter of 2024, we are raising the midpoint of our annual oil production guidance to 192 mbopd from our previously announced midpoint oil production guidance of 190 mbopd. In addition, we are raising the midpoint of our annual oil equivalent production guidance to 393 mboed from our previously announced midpoint oil equivalent production guidance of 390 mboed.

 International 
 In our International segment, we own interests in multiple facilities in E.G. This includes a 64 operated working interest in the Alba field, located offshore E.G., which is consolidated in our financial statements on a pro rata basis. We also own interests in several facilities onshore E.G. which are accounted for as equity method investments. This includes a 52 interest in Alba Plant LLC, which operates an LPG processing plant; a 56 interest in EG LNG, which operates a 3.7 mmta LNG production facility; and a 45 interest in AMPCO, which operates a methanol plant. For additional information on our interests and their operations, refer to Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Table of Contents 

 As described in Market Conditions , prior to 2024, we primarily sold natural gas to equity method investees via Gas Sales Agreements (GSA s) in the form of feedstock for LNG and methanol production at long-term fixed prices. AMPCO markets methanol at market prices, and EG LNG marketed LNG on a market-based contract indexed to Henry Hub pricing. We also sell a certain amount of natural gas for local electricity generation at a long-term fixed price. Whereas the GSA with AMPCO continues into 2026, beginning January 1, 2024, the GSA to sell natural gas to EG LNG, and the contract for EG LNG to sell LNG indexed to Henry Hub pricing, expired and were replaced by a new series of agreements. The Alba field partners no longer sell natural gas under a GSA to EG LNG; instead, EG LNG earns a tolling fee to provide liquefaction, storage and product handling services as well as a profit share, and as an Alba partner, we now market our share of LNG to third parties indexed at global LNG prices. We also assume responsibility for shrink and plant losses during liquefaction, which results in lower reported net production and sales volumes, and we are subject to a lifting schedule for our equity LNG cargos, which may place us in an underlift/overlift position depending on timing. In our consolidated statements of income, our sales of LNG to third parties are included in revenues from contracts with customers. The fees payable to EG LNG are recorded as related party shipping, handling and other operating expense, and our share of this income earned by EG LNG is included in income from equity method investments. In addition to servicing the Alba field, EG LNG processes additional third-party gas from the Alen field under a combination of a tolling fee and profit-sharing arrangement, the benefits of which are also included in our respective share of income from equity method investments. 
 In 2024, our initial sales of LNG under this new contract occurred. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net sales volumes of LNG were 72 mmcfd, at an average realized price of 10.76 per mcf. We recorded 72 million in revenue for these sales, and incurred expense of 18 million to EG LNG for their services. We recorded 39 million in income from equity method investments for the period and International segment income of 95 million. We also held a positive balance of LNG inventory at quarter end, that was included in our October sales. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net sales volumes of LNG were 86 mmcfd, at the average realized price of 8.76 per mcf. We recorded 207 million in revenue for these sales, and incurred expense of 45 million to EG LNG for their services. We recorded 104 million in income from equity method investments for the period and International segment income of 256 million. 
 In 2024, due to the expected arbitrage between LNG and methanol pricing, we have chosen to optimize our E.G. integrated gas operations by redirecting a portion of Alba field natural gas from AMPCO to the LNG production facility operated by EG LNG. 
 The table below provides details regarding net sales volumes for our operations within this segment:

 Market Conditions 
 Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows, the amount of capital we invest in our business, redemption of our debt and payment of dividends. Commodity prices experienced significant volatility in 2022 after the Russia/Ukraine conflict began and this has continued into 2024. Events in the Middle East have added further volatility to energy prices and the outlook for that region remains extremely uncertain. Further, uncertainty around Chinese demand continues to exacerbate volatility as sluggish demand is countered by reports of fiscal stimulus. Economic headwinds should diminish moving forward as inflation has moderated and interest rates have started to fall. We expect commodity price volatility to continue given the complex global dynamics of supply and demand that exist in the market. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on how volatility in commodity prices could impact us.

 Crude oil and condensate Alba field liquids production is primarily condensate. We generally sell our share of condensate in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. Alba Plant LLC processes the rich hydrocarbon gas which is supplied by the Alba field under a fixed-price long-term contract. Alba Plant LLC extracts NGLs and condensate which is then sold by Alba Plant LLC at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Alba Plant LLC delivers the processed dry natural gas to the Alba Unit Parties for distribution to AMPCO and EG LNG. 
 NGLs Wet gas is sold to Alba Plant LLC at a fixed-price long-term contract resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. Alba Plant LLC extracts and keeps NGLs, which are sold at market price, with our share of income from Alba Plant LLC being reflected in the income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. 
 Natural gas Prior to 2024, dry natural gas, processed by Alba Plant LLC on behalf of the Alba Unit Parties, was sold by the Alba field to our equity method investees EG LNG and AMPCO at fixed-price contracts resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. EG LNG marketed LNG on a market-based contract and AMPCO markets methanol at market prices. The gas sales contract between Alba Unit and EG LNG expired on December 31, 2023. The gas sales contract with AMPCO expires in 2026. 
 In March 2023, we announced the signing of a Heads of Agreement HOA to progress the development of the Equatorial Guinea Regional Gas Mega Hub. In October 2023, we announced the signing of a 5-year firm LNG sales agreement for a portion of our Alba gas liquefied at EG LNG. The contract was effective January 1, 2024, and features a pricing structure linked to the Dutch Title Transfer Facility TTF index, providing us with significant incremental exposure to the European LNG market. In addition, we have entered into an agreement to sell the remainder of our 2024 LNG volumes under a contract linked to the Japan/Korea Marker JKM ). 
 In addition to processing Alba Unit gas, Alba Plant LLC and EG LNG process third-party gas from the Alen field under a combination of a tolling and a market linked profit-sharing arrangement, the benefits of which are included in our respective share of income from equity method investees. This profit-sharing arrangement provides additional exposure to global LNG market prices.

 Shipping, handling and other operating increased 40 million in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, due to increases in purchases of commodity volumes for resale to satisfy transportation commitments and increases in related party shipping, handling and other operating expense due to the new agreement that became effective in January 2024, whereby EG LNG processes LNG for a tolling fee and profit share. 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 
 Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore volumes have an impact on DD A expense. The following table provides DD A expense and DD A expense rates for each segment:

 Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. Taxes other than income decreased 14 million in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower sales revenue in our U.S. segment, when compared to the same period in 2023. 
 General and administrative expenses increased 16 million in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to increases in legal service expenses associated with the Merger, and an increase in the annual employee bonus accrual estimated to payout at the maximum percentage as a result of the Merger. 
 Net interest and other decreased 17 million in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to the full repayment of the remaining outstanding borrowings of 1.2 billion on the Term Loan Facility in the first quarter of 2024 and the subsequent issuance of our 2029 Notes and 2034 Notes at lower interest rates. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 Provision for income taxes increased 52 million in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to a 75 million deferred tax valuation allowance against foreign tax credits expiring in future periods, partially offset by a decrease in income before income taxes for the current quarter when compared to the same period in 2023. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 Segment Income 
 Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding items not allocated to the operating segments.

 United States segment income in the third quarter of 2024 was 362 million of income versus 505 million of income for the same period in 2023. The decrease in segment income is a result of the variances described above. 
 International segment income in the third quarter of 2024 was 95 million of income versus 62 million of income for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased revenue from new LNG sales indexed to global prices, partially offset by increased provision for income taxes as a result of increased revenue, and increased shipping and handling costs associated with LNG processing and liquefaction.

 Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes in the third quarter of 2024 was a loss of 170 million versus a loss of 114 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in loss was primarily due to an increased provision for income taxes due to a 75 million valuation allowance booked in the third quarter of 2024 and variances in general and administrative expense described above. The increase in loss was partially offset by decreases in net interest and other, described above, and a net unrealized gain on commodity derivatives in the third quarter of 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Other than the item set forth below, there have been no other material changes or developments in the evaluation of the accounting estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies pertaining to our Critical Accounting Estimates disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Income Taxes 
 We have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured at enacted tax rates, for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets to the expected realizable amount by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. Negative evidence includes losses in recent years, as well as the forecasts of future losses in the realizable period. In making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weigh the evidence based on objectivity. 
 We base our future taxable income estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. Future operating conditions can be affected by numerous factors, including (i) future prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, including LNG, (ii) estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, including LNG, (iii) expected timing of production, and (iv) future capital requirements. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions resulting in future taxable income calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future taxable income would likely be partially offset by lower capital expenditures. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 Based on the assumptions and judgments described above, during the third quarter of 2024, as a result of continued volatility in commodity prices and corresponding impacts to projections of future taxable income, we recorded a 75 million deferred tax valuation allowance against foreign tax credits expiring in future periods. We continue to assess whether the balance of the valuation allowance is appropriate on a quarterly basis particularly given the expiring nature of foreign tax credits in years 2025 through 2026. If we experience sustained lower commodity prices that impact the performance of future earnings, it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months sufficient negative evidence may exist that will require us to establish additional valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets that we do not expect to realize. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.

 Sources of cash and cash equivalents 
 Cash flows generated from operating activities during the first nine months of 2024 were 2 higher compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a working capital inflow in the first nine months of 2024 compared to a working capital outflow during the same period in 2023, offset by lower net income during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 On March 28, 2024, we completed a public offering of 1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes (2029 Notes and 2034 Notes). Net proceeds received totaled approximately 1.2 billion and together with cash on hand were used to repay 1.2 billion outstanding borrowings under our Term Loan Facility. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for further information. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we borrowed and repaid 450 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. However, as of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, w e utilize our commercial paper program to fund our short-term working capital requirements. During the first nine months of 2024, we had 270 million in net repayments of commercial paper and as of September 30, 2024 , we have 180 million in remaining outstanding commercial paper borrowings s ee Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for further information.

 Uses of cash and cash equivalents 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased approximately 19 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program at a cost of 516 million and paid dividends of 188 million. 
 Additionally, during the first nine months of 2024, using short-term borrowings, we redeemed 400 million of our outstanding bonds that are part of the 1.0 billion Parish of St. John The Baptist, State of Louisiana Revenue Refunding Bonds (Marathon Oil Corporation Project) Series 2017. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for further information.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following liquidity and capital resources discussion is qualified in its entirety by the limitations contained in the Merger Agreement. Under the Merger Agreement, we are subject to restrictions and limitations that, among other things, preclude us from assuming additional debt, issuing additional equity or debt, making certain capital expenditures and executing certain asset transactions, and entering certain merger, liquidation or disposition transactions. Upon completion of the Merger and on the closing date, we will terminate all commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility and repay in full all obligations, if any, with respect to our Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper program. 
 Capital Resources and Available Liquidity 
 Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, capital market transactions, our Revolving Credit Facility and our commercial paper program. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 2.5 billion of liquidity consisting of 134 million in cash and cash equivalents and 2.4 billion available under our Revolving Credit Facility. Under the Merger Agreement, however, we are not permitted to exceed an aggregate 1.5 billion in outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program or Revolving Credit Facility except in emergency situations provided that we notify ConocoPhillips of any such borrowings as soon as reasonably practicable. 
 Our working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents, our Revolving Credit Facility and our commercial paper program. Subject to certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement, we may issue commercial paper, draw on our Revolving Credit Facility to meet short-term cash requirements or issue debt or equity securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, dividends and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of how our commitments and contingencies could affect our available liquidity. Additionally, we expect our available liquidity to be impacted by a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Merger Agreement including, among others, fees and expenses from financial advisors and other advisors and representatives, certain employment-related costs relating to employees of Marathon Oil and filing fees due in connection with required regulatory filings. Some of these costs have already been incurred or may be incurred regardless of whether the Merger is completed. Further, general economic conditions, commodity prices and financial, business and other factors could affect our operations and our ability to access the capital markets. 
 We maintain investment grade ratings at all three primary credit rating agencies. A downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital and could result in additional credit support requirements. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of how a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us.

 We may incur additional debt to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities or for general corporate or other purposes. A higher level of indebtedness could increase the risk that our liquidity and financial flexibility deteriorates. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a further discussion of how our level of indebtedness could affect us. 
 Credit Arrangements and Borrowing Developments 
 On March 28, 2024, we completed a public offering of 1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes consisting of 600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.30 2029 Notes and 600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.70 2034 Notes. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually beginning October 1, 2024. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued interest, if any. Net proceeds received totaled approximately 1.2 billion which were used together with cash on hand to repay 1.2 billion outstanding borrowings under our Term Loan Facility. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 On July 1, 2024, using short-term borrowings, we purchased 200 million of our outstanding sub-series 2017 A-2 bonds and 200 million of our outstanding sub-series 2017 B-1 bonds that are part of the 1.0 billion Parish of St. John The Baptist, State of Louisiana Revenue Refunding Bonds (Marathon Oil Corporation Project) Series 2017. The 400 million of bonds due 2037 were purchased on their mandatory put date of July 1, 2024, for our own account and are subject to an interest rate of 4.125 . We have the right, subject to the consent of ConocoPhillips, to convert and remarket these bonds to the public at any time up to their June 1, 2037 maturity date. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 4.6 billion of total long-term debt outstanding. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of 180 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our Revolving Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring that our total debt to total capitalization ratio not exceed 65 as of the last day of the fiscal quarter. Our total debt-to-capital ratio was 22 at September 30, 2024. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 Refer to our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of our long-term debt maturities. 
 Other Sources of Liquidity 
 We have an effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC pursuant to which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer for purposes of SEC rules, subject to market conditions and certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement, are permitted to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt, equity securities and other capital instruments, if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune, in one or more public offerings. 
 Capital Requirements 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program, however, upon the announcement of the Merger Agreement, we suspended our stock repurchase activity as we are subject to certain restrictions to our ability to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire our capital stock. Our remaining authorization at September 30, 2024 was approximately 1.8 billion .

 On October 30, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of 0.11 per share payable December 10, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2024. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are prevented from increasing our quarterly per share dividend in excess of 0.11 per quarter. 
 Income Taxes 
 As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the IRA was signed into law during 2022. Under current law and guidance, we are subject to the corporate book minimum tax in 2024. In September 2024, the IRS issued proposed regulations on the corporate book minimum tax. We have reviewed the proposed regulations and do not expect any material changes to our calculation for 2024. In addition, in September 2024, estimated tax payment relief for the 2024 corporate book minimum tax was granted through the end of the year. As further guidance is issued, we will continue to evaluate and assess the impact the IRA may have on our current and future period income taxes.

 Other Contractual Cash Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, material changes to our contractual cash obligations compared to December 31, 2023 include the previously discussed addition of 1.2 billion in senior notes, the full repayment of 1.2 billion outstanding borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and the 400 million purchase of our outstanding bonds. In addition, we repaid 270 million of net outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
 As described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, we entered into a consent decree with the EPA and Department of Justice that included a civil penalty of 65 million, which was paid in full in October 2024. 
 Additionally, future contractual cash obligations may include liabilities in connection with the Merger Agreement. Certain costs may be incurred even if the Merger is not consummated. 
 Other than the items set forth above, there are no material changes to our consolidated cash obligations to make future payments under existing contracts, as disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies 
 We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. 
 Other than the items set forth in Part II - Item 1. Legal Proceedings , there have been no significant changes to the environmental, health and safety matters under Item 1. Business or Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of other contingencies.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks in the normal course of business including commodity price risk and interest rate risk. We employ various strategies, including the use of financial derivatives to manage the risks related to commodity price and interest rate fluctuations. However, under the Merger Agreement, we are subject to limitations on our ability to enter into new derivative transactions, which may prevent us from using financial derivatives to manage the risks related to commodity price and interest rate fluctuations. 
 See Note 8 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for detail relating to our open commodity derivative positions, including underlying notional quantities, how they are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how their fair values are measured. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had open commodity derivatives related to crude oil and natural gas. Based on the September 30, 2024 published NYMEX WTI and natural gas futures prices, a hypothetical 10 change (per bbl for crude oil and per MMBtu for natural gas) would change the fair values of our commodity derivative positions to the following: 
 (In millions) Fair Value at 
 September 30, 2024 
 Hypothetical Price Increase of 10 Hypothetical Price Decrease of 10 Derivative asset - Crude Oil 8 1 26 Derivative asset (liability) - Natural Gas 2 (3) 7 Total 10 (2) 33 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 At September 30, 2024, our portfolio of current and long-term debt is comprised of floating rate debt and fixed-rate instruments. Our Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper borrowings are floating rate debt instruments, which exposes us to the risk of earnings or cash flow losses as the result of potential increases in market interest rates. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding balance under our Revolving Credit Facility and 180 million outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. Assuming no change in the amount of floating rate debt outstanding, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate under our commercial paper borrowings would have increased our annual interest expense by approximately 2 million. Actual results may vary due to changes in the amount of floating rate debt outstanding. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 4.6 billion outstanding borrowings under fixed-rate debt instruments. Our sensitivity to interest rate movements and corresponding changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt portfolio affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices different than carrying value. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 295 million designated as cash flow hedges. We utilize cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing interest rate swap agreements to hedge variations in cash flows related to the SOFR interest component of future lease payments on our Houston office. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would change the fair values of our cash flow hedges to the following as of September 30, 2024: 
 (In millions) Fair Value at 
 September 30, 2024 
 Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase of 10 Hypothetical Interest Rate Decrease of 10 Interest rate asset - designated as cash flow hedges 11 13 9 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As of the end of the period covered by this Report based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Notices of Violation 
 We received Notices of Violation NOVs from the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA related to alleged violations of the Clean Air Act with respect to our operations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation between 2015 and 2019. To fully resolve this matter, on July 10, 2024, we entered into a consent decree with the EPA and Department of Justice, which was entered by the court on September 17, 2024. The consent decree requires the completion of mitigation projects, implementation of specific injunctive relief, and payment of a 65 million civil penalty, with substantially all of that civil penalty accrued in our quarterly report for the period ending March 31, 2024. In October 2024, we paid the 65 million civil penalty in full. In 2022, we began early implementation of the injunctive requirements, which are scheduled to be completed in 2025 for a total cost of approximately 177 million, over 70 of which has been incurred or included in the 2024 capital budget with the remaining amount to be spent by the end of 2025. The consent decree contains a detailed compliance schedule with deadlines for achievement of milestones through at least 2026 and requirements for ongoing permitting, inspection and monitoring, maintenance, auditing, and reporting. We do not admit liability regarding any of the allegations in the complaint associated with the consent decree and elected to resolve the allegations in a negotiated settlement rather than litigation. We do not believe that the mitigation expenditures, penalties, and injunctive relief that resulted from this settlement will have a material adverse effect on either our business or operations or the previously announced Merger Agreement with ConocoPhillips. 
 Other than the items set forth above, there have been no significant changes to Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item I for a description of such legal and administrative proceedings and Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the reader should carefully consider the factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 Q2 2024 Quarterly Report ). There have been no material changes or updates to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K or Q2 2024 Quarterly Report. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program. Refer to our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for historical share repurchase program authorizations and repurchase activity through December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 1.8 billion of authorization remaining under the share repurchase program. There were no shares of our common stock repurchased during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Upon the announcement of the Merger Agreement, we suspended our stock repurchase activity as we are subject to certain restrictions to our ability to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire our capital stock. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
