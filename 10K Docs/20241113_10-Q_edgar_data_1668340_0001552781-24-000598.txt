Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical or current
fact nor are they assurances of future performance and generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as
 believe, expect, anticipate, intend, target, estimate, 
 continue, positions, plan, predict, project, forecast, 
 guidance, goal, objective, prospects, possible or potential, 
by future conditional verbs such as assume, will, would, should, could 
or may, or by variations of such words or by similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not
limited to, statements related to our belief that sources of available liquidity are adequate to meet our current and expected liquidity
needs, our plans to meet future cash needs through the generation of deposits, and statements regarding our business plan and strategies.
These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time, are difficult
to predict and are generally beyond our control. 

 There are or will be important factors that
could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited
to, the following: 

the
 possibility that the anticipated benefits of our merger (the Merger with CBOA Financial, Inc. CBOA ),
 including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains, are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact
 of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as a result of the strength of the economy, competitive factors
 in the areas where the Company and CBOA do business or as a result of other unexpected factors or events; 

the
 impact of purchase accounting with respect to the Merger, or any change in the assumptions used regarding the assets purchased and
 liabilities assumed to determine their fair value; 

diversion
 of management s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; 

potential
 adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the completion of the Merger; 

the
 integration of the business and operations of CBOA, which may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated or
 have unanticipated adverse results relating to CBOA s existing business; 

challenges
 retaining or hiring key personnel; 

business
 disruptions following the Merger; 

the
 outcome of pending or threatened litigation or of matters before regulatory agencies, whether currently existing or commencing in
 the future, including litigation related to cybersecurity breaches or the Merger; 

increased
 capital requirements, other regulatory requirements or enhanced regulatory supervision; 

the
 inability to increase revenue and earnings; 

the
 inability to efficiently manage operating expenses; 

changes
 in capital markets; 

changes
 in asset quality and credit risk; 

changes
 in deposit costs and liquidity risk; 

adverse
 changes in economic conditions; 

Deterioration
 of the market for commercial real estate, including as a result of continued increasing ecommerce volumes, hybrid or remote work
 arrangements following the COVID-19 pandemic, higher vacancy rates, higher interest rates, property fraud and other factors; 

customer
 borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices; 

the
 impact, extent and timing of technological changes; 

changes
 in legislation, regulation, policies or administrative practices, whether by judicial, governmental or legislative action, including,
 but not limited to, changes pertaining to banking, securities, taxation, rent regulation and housing, financial accounting and reporting,
 environmental protection and insurance, and the ability to comply with such changes in a timely manner; 

changes
 in the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government, including policies of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Federal
 Reserve; 

changes
 in interest rates, which may affect the Company s net income and other future cash flows, or the market value of the Company s
 assets, including its investment securities; 

our
 ability to lower our funding costs at a rate commensurate with any decreases in the rates that we can charge for loans; 

changes
 in accounting principles, policies, practices or guidelines; 

failure
 to attract new customers and retain existing customers in the manner anticipated; 

any
 interruption or breach of security resulting in failures or disruptions in customer account management, general ledger, deposit,
 loan or other systems; 

the
 adverse effects of events beyond our control that may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets and the economy, such as epidemics
 and pandemics, war or terrorist activities, essential utility outages, deterioration in the global economy, instability in the credit
 markets, disruptions in our customers supply chains or disruption in transportation; and 

other
 actions of state and federal banking regulators and legislative and regulatory actions and reforms. 

We caution readers that the foregoing list
of factors is not exclusive, is not necessarily in order of importance and readers should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking
statements. You should also consider the risks, assumptions and uncertainties set forth in the Risk Factors section of
our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do
not intend to and disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after
the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, unless required to do so under the federal
securities laws.

UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER

Allowance
for credit losses - held-to-maturity securities : Held-to maturity securities are carried at
amortized cost net of allowance for credit losses ACL when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them
to maturity. The Company s held-to maturity portfolio consists solely of bank subordinated debt. Management measures expected credit
losses on held-to-maturity debt securities on an individual basis. When accrued interest is reversed or charged-off in a timely manner,
the CECL standard provides a practical expedient to exclude accrued interest from ACL measurement. The Company considers it s nonaccrual
and charge-off policies to be timely for all investments and securities, as such, accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity debt
securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information
that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 

The ACL for pooled loans is estimated
using a non-discounted cash flow methodology. The bank then applies probability of default and loss given default to the cash flow methodology
to calculate expected losses within the model. This allows the bank to identify the timing of default as compared to when the actual
loss event may occur. The results are then aggregated to produce segment level results and reserve requirements for each segment. The
Company uses a 12-month forecast that is reasonable and supportable within the ACL calculation and then reverts to historical credit
loss experience on a straight-line basis over a one-year timeline. Historical loss experience is then used for the remaining life of
the assets. The Company uses several economic variables in the calculation of the ACL, the most significant of which is the economic
forecast for the national unemployment rate. Changes in the economic forecast for unemployment rates could significantly affect the estimated
credit losses which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next. 

Loans that do not share risk
characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not included in the pooled loan evaluation. When
management determines that foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting
date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. 

 Qualitative adjustments to historical
loss data are made based on management s assessment of the risks that may lead to a future loan loss or differences in current
loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, changes in environmental and economic
conditions, or other relevant factors. 

The allowance is increased
by a provision for credit losses, which is charged to expense and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. 

 and , respectively. Cash and stock dividends are recorded in Other Income in the Consolidated Statement
of Comprehensive Income. 

The Company invested in the Castle
Creek Launchpad Fund I, LP in April 2022. The Company has committed to funding up to 2 million over a 4-year funding period. As of September
30, 2024, the investment has a carrying value of 982,000 compared to 828,000 as of December 31, 2023. As of both dates, the investment
was valued using the net asset value practical expedient. The scope of the NAV practical expedient is limited to investments without
readily determinable fair values in entities that calculate NAV per share consistently with the measurement principles of ASC 946, Financial
Services Investment Companies. Both criteria were present at each of the balance sheet dates noted above.

Purchased
Performing Loans (Non-Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans) 

Non-purchased credit deteriorated loans non-PCD loans are loans, of the date of the Merger and based upon management s assessment, which have not experienced
a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since the date the loans were originated. The loan s purchase price becomes
its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the unpaid principal balance of the loan
is a discount, which is comprised of a credit and non-credit component, and is accreted as interest income over the life of the loan. 

An allowance for credit losses is determined
using the same methodology as other loans held for investment. A 4.1 million Day Two allowance for credit losses for non-PCD
loans was recorded through the provision expense for credit losses. This 4.1 million allowance for credit losses for non-PCD loans represents
management s estimate of lifetime credit losses on these non-PCD loans. 

Purchased
Credit Deteriorated Loans 

Purchased credit deteriorated loans PCD loans represent loans, as of the date of the Merger and based upon management s assessment, which had experienced
a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since the date the loans were originated. An allowance for credit losses for
PCD loans was determined using the same methodology as other loans held for investment. The initial allowance for credit losses for PCD
loans was determined on a collective basis and was allocated to individual PCD loans. This allowance for credit losses is reflected as
a Day 2 on-balance sheet gross-up to the allowance for credit losses and as an increase to PCD loans. The PCD loans 
purchase price of 26.2 million plus the allowance for credit losses of 1.1 million, becomes the initial amortized cost basis of 27.3
million for the PCD loans. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the unpaid principal balance of the PCD loans
of 30.4 million, results in a non-credit discount for the PCD loans of 3.1 million, which is accreted as interest income over the life
of the PCD loans. Thereafter, the PCD loans are subject to the same interest rate recognition and credit model as non-PCD loans, with
changes to the allowance for credit losses recorded through provision expense.

pre-Merger loan fee income of 230,000 and related taxes of 58,000 (iii) interest expense increase related to deposit liability and
long-term debt discount expense of 52,000 and related taxes of 13,000; (iii) non-interest expense decrease due to removal of Merger
expenses for both CBOA and the Bank of 660,000 and related taxes of 36,000; and (iv) non-interest expense increase due to Core Deposit
Intangible amortization expense of 415,000 and related taxes of 104,000. The pro forma net loss for the three months ended September
30, 2023, also reflects a 3 million pre-tax provision for credit losses in connection with one troubled real estate credit. 

Pro forma amounts for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, primarily reflect the following pro forma adjustments: (i) interest and fee income decrease related to lower loan
discount accretion income of 277,000 and related taxes of 70,000; (ii) interest and fee income decrease due to the removal of CBOA s
pre-Merger loan fee income of 175,000 and related taxes of 44,000; (iii) interest expense decrease related to deposit liability and
long-term debt discount expense of 141,000 and related taxes of 35,000; (iv) provision for credit losses decrease due to removal of
the Merger-related non-recurring Day 2 Non-PCD Loan charge of 4.1 million and related taxes of 1 million; and (v) non-interest income
decrease due to removal of a non-recurring non-taxable 5 million preliminary bargain purchase gain. Additionally, there were non-interest
expense pro forma adjustments, which were primarily comprised of: (i) removal of Merger expenses for both CBOA and the Bank of 4.4 million
and related taxes of 962,000; (ii) removal of Merger-related non-recurring change-in-control charges of 654,000 and related taxes of
 164,000; and (iii) Core Deposit Intangible amortization expense increase of 221,000 and related taxes of 55,000. 

Pro forma amounts for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, primarily reflect the following pro forma adjustments: (i) interest and fee income increase related to loan discount
accretion income of 2.3 million and related taxes of 581,000; (ii) interest and fee income decrease due to the removal of CBOA s
pre-Merger loan fee income of 576,000 and related taxes of 144,000; (iii) interest expense increase related to deposit liability and
long-term debt discount expense of 246,000 and related taxes of 62,000; (iv) non-interest expense decrease related to removal of Merger
expenses for both CBOA and the Bank of 1.8 million and related taxes of 54,000; and (iii) non-interest expense increase related to
Core Deposit Intangible amortization expense of 1.3 million and related taxes of 320,000. The pro forma earnings for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, also reflect a 3 million pre-tax provision for credit losses in connection with one troubled real estate credit. 

Management prepared these pro forma results
for comparative purposes only and these pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that would have been obtained
had the Merger actually occurred on January 1, 2023. No assumptions have been applied to the pro forma revenues and pro forma earnings
regarding, for example, possible revenue enhancements, expense efficiencies, fixed cost leverage opportunities, or non-earning asset
dispositions. 

Additionally, the pro forma amounts for
Bancorp 34 s weighted average basic and diluted common shares outstanding are based upon: (i) Bancorp 34 s actual weighted
average basic and diluted common shares outstanding for each of the periods presented; together with and as adjusted for (ii) Bancorp
34 s approximate 2.7 million common shares issued in connection with the Merger, as if the Merger had occurred on January 1, 2023.

Separately, management has determined that
it is impractical to report amounts of revenue and earnings of CBOA after the Merger date of March 19, 2024. Bank core systems and related
data conversions occurred, after the Merger date, from March 22, 2024, through March 25, 2024. Accordingly, management believes that
reliable, accurate, separate, and complete revenue and earnings information for CBOA is no longer available.

Unrealized losses on U.S. Treasury bonds
and U.S. Agency bonds have not been recognized through the income statement due to the bonds being backed in full by the United States
government. Management has no intent to sell the securities, the Company can hold the securities to maturity, and the decline in fair
value is largely due to changes in market interest rates. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity
date. 

Unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities
have not been recognized into income. At September 30, 2024, 84 of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio were issued by U.S. government
sponsored entities or agencies. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates, and not credit quality,
and because the Company does not intend to sell the mortgage-backed securities, no unrealized losses have been recognized into income. 

The remainder of the mortgage-backed securities
portfolio includes non-agency structured commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) with a fair value of 5,020,000 which had unrealized
losses of 447,000 at September 30, 2024. Each CMBS was rated AAA at September 30, 2024. These bonds have significant credit enhancement
and have performed as agreed. Management does not intend to sell the CMBS and it is likely that management will not be required to sell
the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. 

Unrealized losses on available-for-sale
municipal obligation securities have not been recognized through the income statement. As of September 30, 2024, the credit rating for
these securities ranges from A+ to AAA. General Obligation bonds represent 30 of the municipal bond portfolio. The remaining 70 of
the portfolio consists of revenue bonds, the majority of which are essential purpose or have an insurance wrapper. Management has no
intent to sell these securities and can hold the securities to maturity. The decline in fair value is largely due to changes in market
interest rates and management expects the fair value to recover as the securities approach their maturity date. 

Management evaluated the foregoing available-for-sale
securities for potential impairment as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, including the preceding analysis summary, management
has determined that the unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are primarily attributable to increases in market interest
rates and do not reflect credit losses. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, management concluded that an allowance for credit losses
on available-for-sale securities is not necessary, as the decline in fair value is not indicative of credit losses. Management will continue
to monitor the fair value of these available-for-sale securities and reassess the need for an allowance for credit losses if circumstances
change.

Credit
quality indicators The following tables represent the credit exposure by internally
assigned grades. This grading analysis estimates the capability of the borrower to repay the contractual obligations of the loan agreements
in accordance with the loan terms. The Bank s internal credit risk grading system is based on management s experiences with
similarly graded loans. Credit risk grades are reassessed each quarter based on any recent developments potentially impacting the creditworthiness
of the borrower, as well as other external statistics and factors, which may affect the risk characteristics of the respective loan.
The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 

 Pass :
Strong credit with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management s close attention. 

 Special
Mention : Potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. Borrower and
guarantor s capacity to meet all financial obligations is marginally adequate or deteriorating. 

 Substandard :
Inadequately protected by the paying capacity of the borrower and/or collateral pledged. The borrower or guarantor is unwilling or unable
to meet loan terms or loan covenants for the foreseeable future. 

 Doubtful :
All the weakness inherent in one classified as substandard with the added characteristic that those weaknesses in place make the collection
or liquidation in full, on the basis of current conditions, highly questionable and improbable. 

 Loss
 Considered uncollectible or no longer a bankable asset. This classification does not
mean that the asset has no recoverable value. In fact, a certain salvage value is inherent in these loans. Nevertheless, it is not practical
or desirable to defer writing off a portion or whole of a perceived asset even though partial recovery may be collected in the future. 

 The following tables present the
amortized cost basis of loans by credit quality indicator, by class of financing receivable, and year of origination for term loans as
of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. For revolving lines of credit that are converted to term loans, if the conversion involved
a credit decision, such loans are included in the origination year in which the credit decision was made. If revolving lines of credit
converted to term loans without a credit decision, such lines of credit are included in the Revolving lines of credit converted
to term column in the following tables (dollars in thousands).

Non-accrual
loans The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan becomes 90
or more days delinquent unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection or renewal due to maturity. Past due status
is based on the contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual status or charged off if collection of interest
or principal is considered doubtful. There was no interest income recognized from non-accrual loans in the income statement for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, or September 30, 2023. The following presents the amortized cost basis of loans on non-accrual status

Modifications Made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty The ACL incorporates

financial difficulty is already included in the ACL allowance for credit losses, a change to the ACL is generally not recorded when a

Discount Window. 

The Bank has established a borrowing line
at the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. As of September 30, 2024, borrowing capacity totaled million and collateral consists
of a blanket lien on the loan portfolio. There were no outstanding borrowings on the borrowing line as of September 30, 2024, or December

As of September 30, 2024, and December 31,
2023, the Bank had available unsecured Federal Funds lines of credit at correspondent banks totaling million and million ,
respectively. The terms of the borrowings are overnight at the applicable fed funds borrowing rate. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank
had borrowings under these lines of credit. 

On September 29, 2021, the Company completed
a private placement of million of 10 year, fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes. The subordinated notes initially bear interest
at 4.00 per annum for five years, floating at Three-Month SOFR plus 328 basis points quarterly thereafter. The ten-year notes mature
on July 15, 2031, and are callable at the Company s option after five years. The subordinated notes have unamortized origination
fees of at September 30, 2024. As part of the Merger with CBOA, 1.5 million of the subordinated debt was acquired in the transaction
and subsequently retired. 

As part of the Merger with CBOA, the Company
acquired CBOA Financial Statutory Trust #1, a trust formed by CBOA in November 2005. The trust closed a pooled private offering of 5,000
trust preferred securities with a liquidation amount of 1,000 per security. CBOA made a required equity contribution of 155,000 to
form the trust and issued 5 million of subordinated debentures to the trust in exchange for ownership of all of the common securities
of the trust and the proceeds of the preferred securities sold by the trust. The Company is able to redeem the subordinated debentures,
in whole or in part, in a principal amount with integral multiples of 1,000, at 100 of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest until maturity in 2036. The subordinated debentures are also redeemable in whole or in part from time to time, upon the occurrence
of specific events defined within the trust indenture. Bancorp 34 has the option to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures
from time to time, for a period not to exceed five consecutive years. Bancorp 34 has elected not to defer interest payments on the subordinated
debentures. The trust preferred securities have a variable rate of interest, reset quarterly on the 23rd of each February, May, August,
and November, equal to the sum of 3-month CME term SOFR plus 1.70 . As of September 30, 2024, the rate was 7.06 . Bancorp 34 s
investment in the common stock of the trust is 155,000, which is included in other assets and is accounted for as an unconsolidated
cost-method investment. Bancorp 34 is not considered the primary beneficiary of this trust, and therefore the trust is not consolidated
in the financial statements. Rather the subordinated debentures are shown as a liability. The remaining Merger-related fair value mark
on the CBOA Financial Statutory Trust #1 subordinated debt was 972,000 as of September 30, 2024.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements
to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. 

Since many of the commitments are expected
to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates
each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon
extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation Collateral held varies by and may include accounts receivable,
inventory, property and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties. 

Standby letters of credit are conditional
commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. Standby letters of credit generally have
fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of
credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank s policy for obtaining collateral,
and the nature of such collateral, is essentially the same as that involved in making commitments to extend credit. The Bank had one
standby letter of credit totaling at September 30, 2024, and standby letters of credit at December 31, 2023.

totaling 100,000, to one related party on September 30, 2024. There were no additional loans to related parties as of September 30,
2024. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2024, Bancorp 34 paid 216,000 to outgoing directors no longer serving on the board. This amount is included in Merger Costs on the income
statement and is also included in the relevant pro forma adjustments in Note 2 herein. 

and , respectively. 

 The Company accounts for forfeitures when
they occur by reversing any previously accrued compensation expense on forfeited options in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation
 Stock Compensation. 

On November 17, 2017, the Company s
stockholders approved the adoption of the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan 2017 Plan ). The 2017 Plan provided for the grant
of a maximum of shares of the Company s common stock of which up to shares of common stock could be granted for
stock options and shares of common stock could be issued as restricted stock to Directors and employees of the Company. Stock
options and restricted stock awards currently issued under the 2017 Plan vest at 20 per year beginning on the first anniversary of date
of grant and the options expire seven years after the grant date. 

 On May 25, 2022, the
Company s stockholders approved the adoption of the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan 2022 Plan ). The 2022 Plan provided
for the grant of a maximum of shares of the Company s common stock of which up to shares of common stock could
be issued as restricted stock and shares of common stock could be granted for stock options to directors and employees of the
Company. The board of directors compensation committee specified the vesting schedules for the restricted stock and options. Option
expiration dates were flexible as well but could not exceed ten years from the grant date. 

 On September 25, 2024, the Company s
Board of Directors approved the termination of the 2017 Plan and the 2022 Plan. While outstanding awards issued under those plans were
not affected by the plans termination, no further awards may be granted under either the 2017 Plan or the 2022 Plan. In connection
with the termination of the 2017 Plan and the 2022 Plan, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the Bancorp 34, Inc. 2024 Equity
Incentive Plan (the 2024 Plan ). The 2024 Plan provides for the grant of a maximum of 525,000 shares of the Company s
common stock pursuant to a variety of equity incentive awards, including restricted stock, stock options, and other awards. As of September
30, 2024, no awards had been issued under the 2024 Plan. 

The stock option plans allow for net settlement
of vested options. In a net settlement, the Company, at the direction of the optionee, net settles the options by issuing new shares
to the optionee with a value, at the current per share trading price, equal to the total in-the-money or intrinsic value of the options
less any necessary tax withholdings on the disqualifying disposition of Incentive Stock Options. The optionee is granted newly issued
shares and a small amount of cash in lieu of partial shares. There were no net settlements for the first nine months of 2024 or 2023. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2024, no stock compensation was issued under any equity incentive plan. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, stock options
were granted and shares of restricted stock were issued. Stock option grant-date fair values for 2023 were computed using the
Black Scholes Merton options pricing model with the following weighted-average inputs and assumptions:

The fair values of certain of these instruments
were calculated by discounting expected cash flows, which involves significant judgments by management and uncertainties. Fair value
is the estimated amount at which financial assets or liabilities could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties,
other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Because no market exists for certain of these financial instruments and because management
does not intend to sell these financial instruments, the Bank does not know whether the fair values shown represent values at which the
respective financial instruments could be sold individually or in the aggregate. 

There were no transfers between levels of
the fair value hierarchy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, or the year ended December 31, 2023.

 As of September 30, 2023, the Bank
experienced a deterioration of one large out of market commercial real estate loan which resulted in this loan becoming nonperforming.
As of December 31, 2023, a 3.3 million loss was reflected in the Bank s operating results, and the remaining 3 million balance
was transferred to other real estate owned. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the note associated with this loan was sold
for 2.6 million and a 432,000 pre-tax loss was reflected in the Bank s operating results. 

 At September 30, 2024, and December 31,
2023, there were no foreclosed residential real estate properties recorded as a result of obtaining physical possession of the properties.
In addition, at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were no recorded investments of consumer mortgage loans secured by residential
real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process. 

shares of common stock and shares of convertible, non-voting Series A perpetual preferred stock at 14.00 per share
each, generating net cash proceeds of approximately million . The Company used the net proceeds from these private placements to
support the acquisition of CBOA Financial, Inc. and to enhance capital ratios. 

 In conjunction with the private placements,
the Company issued warrants to purchase up to 211,667 shares of Common Stock at a price of 14.00. The approximate fair value of the
warrants was deemed immaterial by management. The Warrants are exercisable at any time after their grant date, and from time to time,
in whole or in part, for 7 years from their grant dates, on December 30, 2029, and January 27, 2030. The exercise of such Warrants remains
subject to certain contractual provisions and a cashless exercise may be executed. 

 Non-voting
common stock In accordance with the capital raise, and in conjunction with shareholder
approval at the Annual Meeting that occurred on September 29, 2023, a class of non-voting common stock was created on July 19, 2023.
On said date, the State of Maryland approved the Articles Supplementary to the Articles of Incorporation for Bancorp 34, Inc. in which
a class of authorized stock containing shares of non-voting common stock was established. In accordance with the stipulations
established during the capital raise, the preferred stock issued during the raise was converted to the newly established class of non-voting
common stock as of the date the class was created. Except for voting privileges, the new class of non-voting common stock is treated
pari-passu with common stock.

Item 2.
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 In
this section, unless the context suggests otherwise, references to we, us, our, and the
Company mean the combined business of Bancorp 34 and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Southwest Heritage Bank. 

The purpose of this
discussion and analysis is to focus on significant changes in: (i) the financial condition of Bancorp 34, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiary,
Southwest Heritage Bank, from December 31, 2023, through September 30, 2024; and (ii) our results of operations for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K,
and information presented elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly the unaudited consolidated financial statements
and related notes appearing in Item 1. 

Overview 

Bancorp 34, headquartered
in Scottsdale, Arizona, is the holding company for Southwest Heritage Bank (formerly Bank 34). On March 19, 2024, Bancorp 34 acquired
CBOA Financial, Inc. CBOA ). Immediately following the acquisition, CBOA s wholly-owned subsidiary, Commerce Bank
of Arizona, was merged with and into Bancorp 34 s wholly-owned subsidiary, Bank 34, a federally chartered stock covered savings
association the CBOA Merger ). Bank 34 was subsequently rebranded as Southwest Heritage Bank. Southwest Heritage Bank provides
a variety of banking services to individuals and businesses through its eight full-service community bank branches, three in Maricopa
County, Arizona, in the cities of Scottsdale and Gilbert; three in Pima County, Arizona, in the cities of Tucson and Green Valley; one
branch in Otero County, New Mexico in the city of Alamogordo; and one branch in Dona Ana County New Mexico, in the city of Las Cruces. 

We offer a full range
of relationship-focused services to meet our clients business and personal financial objectives. Our product lines include commercial
loans, commercial real estate loans, and a variety of commercial and consumer deposit products, including noninterest bearing accounts,
interest-bearing demand products, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We also offer online banking and
bill payment services, online cash management, safe deposit box rentals, debit card and ATM card services and the availability of a network
of ATMs for our customers. 

We generate
most of our income from interest income on loans, investment securities and deposits in other financial institutions, and service charges
on customer accounts. We incur interest expenses on deposits and other borrowed funds and non-interest expenses such as salaries and
employee benefits, occupancy expenses, and technology expenses. Net interest income is the largest source of revenue. Net interest spread
is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin
is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as
noninterest-bearing deposits and shareholders equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit
of these noninterest-bearing sources. 

 Changes in the
market interest rates and interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume
and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities, and shareholders equity, are usually
the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin, and net interest income. Fluctuations in market
interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments,
changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international conditions, and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets.
Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in Southwest Heritage Bank s loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors,
economic and competitive conditions in Arizona and New Mexico, as well as developments affecting the real estate, technology, financial
services, insurance, transportation, manufacturing and homebuilding sectors within Southwest Heritage Bank s target market. 

 Bancorp
34 manages its operations as one unit, and thus does not have separate operating segments.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our consolidated financial
statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
or GAAP, and follow general practices within the banking industry. These policies require reliance on estimates, assumptions
and judgments, which may prove inaccurate and are subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, estimates, assumptions or judgements
could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. 

Certain policies inherently
have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results
that could be materially different than originally reported. We have identified the following as critical accounting estimates: (i) determination
of the allowance for credit losses; (ii) determining the fair values of the net assets acquired and the fair value of the common stock
consideration in connection with the CBOA Merger; (iii) other fair value measurements; (iv) accounting for derivatives and hedging activities;
and (v) estimating the effective tax rate for the Company for 2024 in full to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective
or complex judgments and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new or additional information becomes available or circumstances
change, including overall changes in the economic climate and/or market interest rates. Therefore, we consider these policies, discussed
below, to be critical accounting estimates and discuss them directly with the Audit Committee of our board of directors. 

Our significant accounting
policies are presented in our audited consolidated financial statements, Note 1 Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting
Policies, for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. These policies, along with the
disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and, in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets and
liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Recent accounting pronouncements and standards
that have impacted or could potentially affect us are also discussed in Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements, included
in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Allowance
for credit losses 

One significant
accounting policy is our accounting policy related to the allowance for credit losses ACL ). Effective January 1, 2023,
we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Measurement of Current Expected Credit Losses on Financial Instruments CECL ), using
the modified retrospective method for our financial assets measured at amortized cost. CECL changed our method of accounting for credit
losses from an incurred loss model to an expected credit loss model. Under the prior incurred loss model, credit losses on financial
instruments were recognized when a probable loss was incurred, while CECL is an expected credit loss model. The expected
credit loss model represents management s estimate of expected credit losses to the full contractual maturity of the financial
asset and is based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. We believe the determination
of the ACL involves a greater amount of judgment and complexity when compared with our other significant accounting policies. 

 Qualitative
factors are used in the CECL model to address various internal and external factors that may not be captured by the quantitative modeling
or historical data needed to assess the expected credit losses. Qualitative factors considered include, but may not be limited to, the
following: lending policies and procedures; changes in underwriting standards; nature and volume of financial assets; changes in lending
staff; volume and severity of past due or adversely classified assets; changes in collateral values; and the internal credit review function. 

 The Company
uses a 12-month forecast that is reasonable and supportable within the ACL calculation and then reverts to historical credit loss experience
on a straight-line basis over a one-year timeline. Historical credit loss experience is then used for the remaining life of the assets.
The Company uses several economic variables in the calculation of the ACL, the most significant of which is the economic forecast for
the national unemployment rate. In our September 30, 2024, ACL estimate, the Company assumed a forecasted unemployment rate of 4.6 ,
which slightly improved from the December 31, 2023, forecasted rate of 4.7 . Changes in the economic forecast for unemployment rates
could significantly affect the estimated credit losses which could potentially lead to materially different ACL levels from one reporting
period to the next. 

 For our bank,
CECL requires a separate ACL for each of: (i) loans held-for-investment; (ii) unfunded commitments; and (iii) held-to-maturity debt securities. 
 
 47 

ACL
 Loans held-for-investment 

 The level of the ACL
on loans held-for-investment is calculated to maintain a credit loss reserve level that management considers sufficient to absorb estimated
credit losses. Management s determination of the adequacy of the ACL is based on the periodic evaluation of borrowers abilities
to make loan payments, local and national economic conditions, and other subjective factors. The evaluation has subjective components
requiring significant estimates that include default probabilities, expected loss given default, and estimated credit losses based on
historical credit loss experience and forecasted economic conditions. All these factors may be susceptible to significant change and
when actual results differ from the estimates, additional provisions for credit losses may be required, which would adversely impact
profitability. 

The ACL for pooled
loans is estimated using a non-discounted cash flow methodology. The Bank then applies probability of default and loss given default
to the cashflow methodology to calculate expected losses within the model. This allows the Bank to identify the timing of default as
compared to when the actual loss event may occur. The results are then aggregated to produce segment level results and reserve requirements
for each segment. The quantitative model also incorporates forward-looking macroeconomic information over a reasonable and supportable
period of twelve months with a reversion to historical losses occurring on straight line basis over the next 12 months. 

Loans that do not share
risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not included in the pooled loan evaluation.
When management determines that foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the
reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. 

Qualitative adjustments
to historical loss data are made based on management s assessment of the risks that may lead to a future loan loss or differences
in current loan-specific risk characteristics. A ratings scale is used to tie risk metrics within lending policies and procedures, economic
factors encompassed in the quantitative model, changes in nature of the volumes and terms of loans, changes in the volume and severity
of past due assets, and concentrations within the loan portfolio. Additional factors such staffing, loan review, collateral values, regulatory,
legal, and technological risks are also reviewed on a more qualitative basis. The ratings scale used in the qualitative modeling is derived
from the Bank s historical loss percentages in which the highest risk metrics would align with the highest historical loss percentages
adjusted for the expected life of the current portfolio. 

Management has determined
that calculating an ACL amount for accrued interest receivable on loans held-for-investment would not be significant, and this is excluded
from our estimate of credit losses for loans held-for-investment. Additionally, we write off applicable accrued interest receivable balances
in a timely manner when a loan is placed on non-accrual status, in which any accrued interest, not received in cash, is reversed from
interest income. 

The ACL also excludes
loans held-for-sale and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Assets purchased with credit deterioration PCD assets represent assets that are acquired with evidence of more than insignificant credit quality deterioration since origination at
the acquisition date. At acquisition, the allowance for credit losses on PCD assets is recorded directly to the ACL. Any subsequent changes
in the ACL on PCD assets are recorded through the provision for credit losses. 

The ACL is a contra-asset
on our balance sheet that is deducted from the amortized cost of loans held-for-investment to present on our balance sheet the net amount
expected to be collected. Loans are charged off against the ACL when management believes the full or partial non-collectability is confirmed. 

48 

ACL
 Unfunded commitments 

We estimate expected
credit losses on unfunded commitments over the contractual period in which we are exposed to credit risk via our contractual obligations
to extend credit unless such obligations are unconditionally cancellable by us. The probability of funding such commitments in the future
is based on historical utilization statistics for unfunded commitments. The credit loss rates used are calculated using the same assumptions
as the associated funded balance. 

The ACL on unfunded
commitments is categorized in other liabilities on our balance sheet and, from time to time, is adjusted as a provision for credit loss
expense. 

 ACL
 Held-to-maturity debt securities 

 Management measures
expected credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities on a collective basis by major security type. Our held-to-maturity debt securities
is comprised of bank subordinated debt. The ACL on held-to-maturity debt securities is adjusted through provision for credit losses and
is recorded as a contra asset to held-to-maturity debt securities. Management has determined that calculating an ACL amount for accrued
interest receivable on held-to-maturity debt securities would not be significant, and this is excluded from our estimate of credit losses
for held-to-maturity debt securities. 

Upon our January
1, 2023, CECL adoption, we recorded an increase to the ACL on loans held-for-investment of 604,000, established an ACL on unfunded commitments
of 165,000, established an ACL on held-to-maturity investments of 38,000, recorded an increase to deferred tax assets of 153,000,
and a corresponding one-time cumulative reduction to retained earnings, net of tax, of 654,000 in the consolidated balance sheet as
of January 1, 2023. 

 Business
Combinations 

Assets acquired, including
identified intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles, and liabilities assumed as a result of a merger or acquisition transaction
are recorded at their estimated fair values. The difference between the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and
the consideration paid is recorded as a bargain purchase gain or goodwill. Management engages third-party specialists to assist in the
development of fair value estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions used to value acquired assets and liabilities assumed include,
but are not limited to, projected cash flows, future growth rates, repayment rates, default rates and losses assuming default, discount
rates, and realizable collateral values. The allowance for credit losses for PCD loans is recognized as part of the acquisition accounting.
The allowance for credit losses for non-PCD loans is recognized as provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the merger
or acquisition. Fair value adjustments are amortized or accreted into the income statement over the estimated lives of the acquired assets
and assumed liabilities. The purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments determine the amount of bargain purchase gain or
goodwill recognized in connection with the merger or acquisition. 

Preliminary estimates
of fair values may be adjusted for a period of no greater than one year subsequent to the merger or acquisition date if new information
is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the merger or acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement
of the amounts recognized as of that date. Adjustments recorded during this measurement period are recognized in the current reporting
period. For further information regarding the CBOA Merger, see Note 2 in our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in
Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

49 

Fair
Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, or if market prices are not available, is estimated using models
employing various techniques. 

The significant assumptions
used in the models are independently verified against observable market data where possible. When observable market data is not available,
the estimate of fair value becomes more subjective and involves a high degree of judgment. In this circumstance, fair value is estimated
based on our judgment regarding the value that market participants would assign to the asset or liability. Therefore, the results cannot
be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability. Also, there
are inherent limitations to any valuation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates
of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results of current or future values. 

A portion of our assets
and liabilities are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. The majority of these assets and liabilities are measured
at fair value on a recurring basis, however, certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis based on the fair value
of the underlying collateral. 

For further information
regarding the valuation of our financial instruments, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 14 
Fair Value Information in our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Derivatives
and Hedging activities 

At the inception of
derivative contracts, we designate derivatives as one of two types based on our intention and belief as to the likely effectiveness of
the hedge. These two types are: (i) a hedge of changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge and (ii) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid
related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge ). 

For a fair value hedge,
the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item, are recognized in current earnings as fair
values change. For a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in other comprehensive income and is reclassified
into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects the earnings. The changes in fair value of derivatives that
do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in current earnings. 

Net cash settlements
on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in interest income or interest expense, based on the item being hedged.
Cash flows on hedges are classified in the cash flow statement in the same line item as the cash flows of the item being hedged. 

The initial fair value
of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet under a systematic
and rational method over the life of the hedging relationship and are presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings
effect of the hedged item. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the hedge components excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness and the amounts recognized in earnings are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. 

We discontinue hedge
accounting when we determine the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item,
the derivative is settled or terminates, a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, a hedged firm commitment is no longer
firm, or the treatment of the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate or intended. When hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent
changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as noninterest income. When a fair value hedge is discontinued, the hedged asset
or liability is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value and the existing basis adjustment is amortized or accreted over the remaining
life of the asset or liability. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transactions are still
expected to occur, gains or losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income are amortized into earnings over the same periods
in which the hedged transactions will affect earnings. 

We are exposed to losses
if a counterparty fails to make its payments under a contract in which the Company is in the net receiving position. We anticipate that
the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligation under our derivative contracts with them. All the contracts to which
we are a party have cash flows that settle monthly or semi-annually.

Income
Taxes 

 Our income tax expense,
deferred tax assets and liabilities, current income taxes payable and receivable, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect
management s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid or refunded. We are subject to income taxes in the United States
and multiple states. Significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense and
related income tax assets and liabilities. 

Deferred income taxes
arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements,
which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the
jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred
tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent and future operations. In projecting
future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the CBOA Merger and incorporate assumptions about the amount of
future state, federal, and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about
future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage
the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative
operating income (loss). 

We believe that it
is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state NOL carryforwards will be realized. As such, we have not provided a valuation
allowance on the deferred tax assets related to these state NOL carryforwards. If our assumptions change and we determine that we will
not be able to realize these NOLs, the tax benefits would then be subject to an estimated valuation allowance on deferred tax assets,
that management would be required to estimate. 

The calculation of
our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions
across our U.S. operations. ASC 740 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely
than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes,
on the basis of the technical merits. 

We record unrecognized
tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation
of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result
in a payment or refund that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences
would then be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. 

CBOA
Financial, Inc. Merger 

On March 19, 2024,
Bancorp 34 completed its previously announced merger with CBOA pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 27, 2023,
as amended (the Merger Agreement ). Under the Merger Agreement, CBOA was merged with and into Bancorp 34, with Bancorp 34
continuing as the surviving entity the CBOA Merger ). Immediately following the completion of the CBOA Merger, CBOA s
wholly-owned subsidiary, Commerce Bank of Arizona, an Arizona state-chartered bank, was merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank
continuing as the surviving bank. 

Pursuant to the terms
of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the CBOA Merger, each CBOA shareholder had the right to receive 0.2628 shares of Bancorp
34 common stock, for each share of CBOA common stock owned by the CBOA shareholder, with cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares.
Additionally, each outstanding CBOA restricted stock unit vested and was cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive
0.2628 shares of Bancorp 34 common stock with respect to each share of CBOA common stock underlying such restricted stock unit. In connection
with the CBOA Merger, Bancorp 34 issued approximately 2.7 million shares of Bancorp 34 common stock, which had a fair value of
approximately 23.3 million based on a common share valuation completed by an independent third party as of the CBOA Merger date. Each
outstanding share of Bancorp 34 common stock remained outstanding and was unaffected by the CBOA Merger. 

Commerce Bank of Arizona
operated five full-service offices serving customers in Gilbert, Green Valley, Oro Valley, Scottsdale and Tucson, Arizona. The combined
banks operate as Southwest Heritage Bank and serve customers from eight full-service offices in Arizona and southern New Mexico. The
core system conversion was executed in March 2024. 

51 

We accounted for the
CBOA Merger using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance the Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standards
Code 805 ASC 805 ), Business Combinations, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of CBOA were recorded at their respective
merger date fair values. The fair values of assets and liabilities are preliminary and subject to refinement for up to one year after
the merger date as additional information related to the merger date fair values becomes available. Effective in March 2024, we recognized
a preliminary bargain purchase gain of 5.1 million in connection with the CBOA Merger (not taxable for income tax purposes), which was
recognized in our first quarter 2024 operating results. The core deposit intangible asset of 8.9 million represents the estimated value
of Commerce Bank of Arizona s long-term deposit relationships with its customers and will be amortized over an estimated weighted
average life of ten years using an accelerated method, which approximates the estimated run-off of the acquired deposits. 

For further information
regarding the CBOA Merger, see Note 2 in our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. of this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q. 

Results
of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

General 

Our results of operations
depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, consisting primarily
of interest income on loans, investment securities and other short-term investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities,
consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings. Our results of operations are also dependent on our generation of non-interest income,
consisting primarily of income from service charges on deposit accounts, interchange and ATM fees, and gains on sales of loans. Other
factors contributing to our results of operations include our provisions for credit losses, income taxes, and non-interest expenses,
such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, amortization of intangible assets, and other operating costs. 

We had net income of
 1.6 million and a net loss of 2.3 million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our third quarter 2024 net income
reflects the second full quarter inclusive of CBOA s operating results. Our net loss for the third quarter of 2023, in large part,
reflects: (i) a 3 million provision for credit losses related to a troubled commercial real estate credit; and (ii) 529,000 of merger
costs. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we had net income of 1.5 million and a net loss of 1.7 million, respectively. Our year-to-date
2024 net income is comprised of pre-tax income of 366,000 and an income tax benefit of 1.2 million. Non-recurring merger-related
items also are reflected in our year-to-date 2024 results, which include: (i) a one-time preliminary bargain purchase gain on the CBOA
Merger of 5 million (none of which is taxable); (ii) 3.8 million of merger expenses (a portion of which is not deductible for income
taxes); and (iii) a Day-2 4.1 million non-PCD loan provision for credit losses in connection with the CBOA Merger. We also incurred
a 432,000 loss on the sale of other real estate owned in the 2024 period. Our 1.7 million net loss for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, includes the 3 million provision for credit losses noted above and 1.3 million of merger expenses. 

For more information
on the CBOA Merger, please see Note 2 in our unaudited financial statements included in Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Net
Interest Income 

Our net interest
income was 8.4 million and 3.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. This 4.9 million increase reflects
the full quarter inclusion of CBOA in our 2024 results, given the closing of the CBOA Merger on March 19, 2024, including 936,000
of accretion income on the CBOA loan fair value mark. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023,
was 21 million and 11.6 million, respectively and this increase similarly reflects the positive impacts from the March 19, 2024,
CBOA Merger, including 2.6 million of accretion income on the CBOA loan fair value mark. The Company expects that easing of
monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Bank, which commenced in late September 2024, will exert downward pressure on earning asset
yields as interest bearing bank balances and variable rate commercial loans reprice lower. The expected decline in earning asset
yields will be partially offset by deposit costs repricing lower. 

Reflecting the positive
impact of the CBOA Merger, average earning assets were 926.7 million and 581.9 million during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Average earning asset yields in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were 6.52 and 5.15 , respectively and reflective of our loan portfolio
repricing in the current interest rate environment. 

Average interest-bearing
liabilities in the third quarter of 2024 of 614.0 million reflect the impacts of the March 2024 CBOA Merger. Average interest-bearing
liabilities in the third quarter of 2023 were 417.7 million. Unrelated to the CBOA Merger, the changing deposit mix reflects a continued
increase in time deposits and the broader market trends in which customers have reduced non-interest- and interest-bearing demand deposits
in favor of term CDs given the rising interest rate environment. 

52 

Average noninterest
bearing deposits were 214.5 million and 91.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, and this increase reflects the CBOA Merger
as previously described.

Rate-Volume
Analysis 

The table below presents
the effect of volume and rate changes on interest income and expense. Changes in volume are based on the current period s average
balance multiplied by the previous period s average rate. Changes in rate are based on the current period s average rate
multiplied by the average balance from the previous period. The net changes attributable to the combined impact of both rate and volume
have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate. In the following table, subtotals and totals
may not add up due to rounding. Rounding differences may occur in the presentation of numbers, and these variances do
not impact the accuracy or reliability of the underlying financial data. All figures are presented in thousands unless otherwise stated.

Allowance
and Provision for Credit Losses Loans held-for-investment 

At September 30, 2024,
and 2023, our ACL for loans held for investment was 10.5 million and 8.4 million, respectively, which represents 1.52 and 1.74 
of loans held for investment, respectively. We maintain the ACL at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb expected credit
losses over the lifetime of our loans held-for-investment. Specifically, identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged
off against the allowance; and recoveries are generally recorded only when sufficient cash payments are received subsequent to the charge-off.

The provision for credit
losses, from time to time, includes a charge to our operating results in order to maintain the ACL at a level consistent with management s
assessment of the collectability of the loans held-for-investment in light of current economic conditions and market trends. Our provision
for credit losses was 3.9 million and 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The 2024 3.9
million provision for credit loss expense primarily reflects the merger-related 4.1 million charge for Non-PCD loans. The 2023
provision for credit losses reflects one problem credit which resulted in 3 million of provision for credit losses and was reflective
of management s best estimate, at the time, of the real estate value underlying this one problem credit. The impact from our CECL
adoption effective January 1, 2023, resulted in a one-time net of income tax charge to retained earnings of 654,000.

increased 3 million in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023, and 11 million for the nine months ended September

Bank s operations as a result of the March 19, 2024, CBOA Merger. Merger costs were nil in the third quarter of 2024 compared to
 529,000 in the third quarter of 2023. Included within the 3.8 million of merger costs incurred during the nine months ended September
30, 2024, is 1.2 million in core processing and online banking contract termination fees. Additionally, our nine months ended September
30, 2024, noninterest expense includes a one-time change-in-control charge of 654,000, in connection with the CBOA Merger. For the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and in connection with the CBOA Merger, we expensed 430,000 and 926,000, respectively of
amortization expense on the merger-related core deposit intangible. For more information on the CBOA Merger, see Note 2 in our unaudited
consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Efficiency
ratio 

The efficiency ratio
is one measure of profitability in the banking industry. This ratio measures the cost of generating one dollar of revenue. That is, the
ratio is designed to reflect the percentage of one dollar which must be expended to generate that dollar of revenue. We calculate this
ratio by dividing non-interest expense by the sum of net interest income, before provision expense for credit losses, and non-interest
income. 

Our efficiency ratio
was 76.15 and 90.69 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, and was 83.90 and 90.84 the nine months ended September
30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. This improvement is partially reflective of the CBOA Merger and related non-recurring material financial
impacts in connection with the CBOA Merger. For more information on the CBOA Merger, see Note 2 in our unaudited consolidated financial
statements included in Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Income
Taxes 

We had a 1.2 million
income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, on 366,000 of pre-tax income. This was primarily a result of two CBOA
Merger-related items: (i) non-taxable preliminary bargain purchase gain of 5 million; and (ii) partially deductible merger costs of
 3.8 million. Our effective rate was 19.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For further information on income taxes, please

at September 30, 2024, and 457 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in our total assets and total loans, respectively, largely
reflects total assets, as adjusted for estimated fair values of 419.3 million, and total loans, as adjusted for estimated fair values,
of 310.9 million, which were acquired in connection with the CBOA Merger. For further information regarding the CBOA Merger, see Note

Our securities portfolio
is used to make various term investments, maintain a source of liquidity and serve as collateral for certain types of borrowings. We
manage our investment portfolio according to written investment policies approved by our board of directors. Investment in our securities
portfolio may change over time based on our funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. Our liquidity levels take into
account anticipated future cash flows and available sources of funds and are maintained at levels that we believe are appropriate to
provide the necessary flexibility to meet our anticipated funding requirements. 

Our investment
securities portfolio consists of securities classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. There were no trading securities in
our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. All available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value
and may be used for liquidity purposes. 

 Our securities available-for-sale
were 58.2 million and 56.7 million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. After the CBOA Merger date, management
liquidated the entire acquired CBOA available-for-sale investment portfolio in late March and early April, and management determined
that these sales prices were the best indicator of the fair value of the CBOA available-for-sale-investment portfolio effective as of
the CBOA Merger date. For further information regarding the CBOA Merger, see Note 2 in our unaudited consolidated financial statements
included in Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Our held-to-maturity
securities which are carried on our balance sheet at amortized costs and net of an allowance for credit losses, were 5.6 million and
 5.7 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Derivatives
and Hedging activities 

Southwest Heritage
Bank is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. As such, from time to time, we enter into interest rate
derivatives as part of our asset liability management strategy to help manage the Bank s interest rate risk position. Derivative
instruments represent contracts between parties that result in one party delivering cash to the other party based on a notional amount
and an underlying term (such as a rate, security price or price index) as specified in the derivative contract. The amount of cash delivered
from one party to the other is determined based on the interaction of the notional amount of the contract with the underlying term. Derivatives
may also be implicit in certain contracts and commitments. 

We recognize derivative
financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument.
We record derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the balance sheet within other assets and other liabilities, respectively.
Changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in income or shareholders equity as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting
and, if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge. 

As part of our interest
rate risk management strategy to manage the Bank s exposure to interest rate movements as a result of the Bank s available-for-sale
fixed rate bond portfolio and in the third quarter of 2024, we entered into two pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swaps (the Pay
Fixed Swap Agreements for a total notional amount of 30 million, both of which were designated as fair value hedges.
The Pay Fixed Swap Agreements involve the Bank s receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange
for the Bank making fixed-rate payments over the life of the derivative contracts without the exchange of the underlying notional amount.
For all period presented, there were no other derivatives. 

The following items
are included on the September 30, 2024, consolidated balance sheet in connection with the Pay Fixed Swap Agreements: (i) 300,000
related to a cash margin account included in cash and cash equivalents; (ii) mark-to-market values of 200,000 as an increase to accrued
interest and other liabilities; and (iv) a 205,000 pre-tax charge as part of accumulated other comprehensive income in equity. Our third
quarter income statement also includes a 45,000 increase to interest income in connection with the Pay Fixed Swap Agreements.
As of September 30, 2024, the amortized cost of the underlying available-for-sale investments being hedged by the Pay Fixed Swap
Agreements was 52 million.

Loans 

Our loan portfolio
represents a broad range of borrowers, primarily in our markets in Arizona and New Mexico, comprised of construction, commercial, commercial
real estate, residential real estate, and consumer financing loans.

Family residential
real estate loans represent loans to consumers collateralized by a mortgage on a residence and include purchase money, refinancing, secondary
mortgages, and home equity loans and lines of credit. 

Commercial loans include
commercial and industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment
and inventory purchases, and other expansion projects. SBA, USDA and other small business lending products are also categorized as commercial
loans. These loans are made primarily in our market areas are underwritten on the basis of the borrower s ability to service the
debt from revenue, and are generally extended under our normal credit standards, controls and monitoring systems. 

Consumer and other
loans include direct consumer installment loans, overdrafts and other revolving loans. 

Construction loans
include both residential and commercial projects. Construction loan terms are dependent upon the project, but in some cases will be longer
term and include both the construction phase as well as longer term financing. 

Commercial real estate CRE loans include owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans for operating commercial
businesses and include loans for long-term financing of land and buildings. No significant concentrations are present within the CRE
portfolio as the bank has made an effort to diversify across various industries and geographic locations. While the majority of these
loans are made primarily in our market area, some of the loans have out of market properties. In response to the deterioration of a large
out of market commercial real estate loan during 2023, management engaged an external party to complete a loan review that included approximately
90 of the out of market collateral portfolio. Additionally, management reviewed the property appraisals associated with the out of market
loans and plans to limit out of market lending moving forward. There is currently heightened CRE loan credit risk across the U.S. due
to continued increasing ecommerce volumes, hybrid or remote work arrangements in many industries following the COVID-19 pandemic, higher
vacancy rates, higher interest rates, property fraud and other factors. In addition, higher interest rates have exacerbated the declining
property values of CRE by increasing initial financing and refinancing costs for CRE borrowers. 

Multifamily loans are
for those properties that have five or more units with borrowers who are primarily commercial entities. The Bank finances loans in several
different multifamily types but does not have a concentration in any one type and does not do any specialty lending in this area. These
loans are made primarily in our market area.

Maturities
and Sensitivity of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates 

The information in
the following table is based on the contractual maturities of individual loans, including loans that may be subject to renewal at their
contractual maturity. Renewal of these loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms upon maturity.
Actual repayments of loans may differ from the maturities reflected below because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with
or without prepayment penalties. The following table summarizes the loan maturity distribution by type and related interest rate characteristics

information regarding the CBOA Merger, also see Note 2 in our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. of
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Nonperforming
Assets 

We have established
policies and procedures to guide us in originating, monitoring and maintaining the credit quality of our loan portfolio. These policies
and procedures are required to be followed by our bankers and underwriters and exceptions to these policies require elevated levels of
approval and are reported to our board of directors. 

Nonperforming assets
include all loans categorized as nonaccrual, other real estate owned and other repossessed assets. The accrual of interest on loans is
discontinued, or the loan is placed on nonaccrual, when the full collection of principal and interest is in doubt. We do not generally
accrue interest on loans that are 90 days or more past due. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, previously accrued but unpaid interest
is reversed and charged against interest income and future accruals of interest are discontinued. Payments by borrowers for loans on
nonaccrual are applied to loan principal. Loans are returned to accrual status when, in our judgment, the borrower s ability to
satisfy principal and interest obligations under the loan agreement has improved sufficiently to reasonably assure recovery of principal
and the borrower has demonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance. In general, we require a minimum of six consecutive months
of timely payments in accordance with the contractual terms before returning a loan to accrual status. 

Historically other
real estate owned (OREO) represents assets acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure. The amounts reported as OREO generally are supported
by recent appraisals, with the appraised values adjusted, where applicable, for expected transaction fees likely to be incurred upon
sale of the property. We typically have incurred recurring expenses relating to OREO in the form of maintenance, taxes, insurance, and
legal fees, among others, until the OREO parcel is disposed. While disposition efforts with respect to our OREO are generally ongoing,
if these properties are appraised at lower-than-expected values or if we are unable to sell the properties at the prices for which we
expect to be able to sell them, we may incur additional losses. Southwest Heritage Bank held 3 million of OREO, represented by one out
of market commercial real estate property, at December 31, 2023, and no OREO at September 30, 2024. 

The following
tables set forth our non-performing assets and related ratios as of each balance sheet date indicated below:

Total nonperforming
assets were 3.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 5.2 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease reflects the sale of the
note for the prior OREO balance, partially offset by certain non-accrual loans acquired through the CBOA Merger on March 19, 2024. 

Potential problem loans
are loans which management has serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms. Management
has not identified any potential problem loans not included in the nonperforming assets table above.

Deposits 

Deposits represent
our primary source of funds. We are focused on growing our core deposits through relationship-based banking with our business and consumer
clients. Total deposits were 785.2 million and 460.0 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The primary
reason for this large increase was the CBOA Merger.

included average brokered CD balances of 9.4 million and 17.6 million, respectively. The decline in our brokered CD deposits in 2024
is due to brokered CD maturities which were paid off with excess cash on hand.

based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank s regulatory reporting requirements. 

Federal
Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank Advances 

Other than deposits,
at times the Bank may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances and Federal Reserve Bank FRB advances as supplementary funding sources to finance our operations. At September 30, 2024, we had 27 million of borrowings through
the FRB s Bank Term Funding Program BTFP established in March 2023. At December 31, 2023, we had 29 million
borrowings through the BTFP. Our advances from the FRB are collateralized by pledged securities. At September 30, 2024, we had 29.2
million in availability through the FRB s Discount Window. As of September 30, 2024, we had 229.4 million in borrowing capacity
at the FHLB of San Francisco.

securities of 27.6 million, securing this BTFP borrowing, to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco s Discount Window. In addition,
 990,000 of accrued interest payable was paid off in connection with the October 2024 full pay off of the BTFP borrowing described above. 

Other
Debt 

In addition
to our FRB advances, we also have subordinated debt amounting to 23.1 million at September 30, 2024, trust preferred securities assumed
in connection with the CBOA Merger totaling 5.2 million, and 1.7 million of Federal Funds purchased. See Note 7 Borrowings in
our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Capital
Raises 

During December 2022
and January 2023, Bancorp 34 completed two private placements of common and preferred stock. Bancorp 34 issued a total of 1,359,497 shares
of common stock and 820,115 shares of convertible, non-voting Series A perpetual preferred Stock at 14.00 per share each, generating
net cash proceeds of approximately 28.6 million. The Company used the net proceeds from these private placements to support the CBOA
Merger and to enhance capital ratios. 

In conjunction with
the private placements, Bancorp 34 issued warrants to purchase up to 211,667 shares of common stock at a price of 14.00. The approximate
fair value of the warrants at the date of grant was not considered significant. The warrants are exercisable at any time after their
grant date, and from time to time, in whole or in part, for seven years from their grant dates, between December 2029 and January 2030.
The exercise of such warrants remains subject to certain contractual provisions and a cashless exercise may be executed. 

For more information
about these private placements, see Note 17 Private Placement of Common and Preferred Stock, in our unaudited financial statements
included in Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Bancorp
34 (Parent Company) 

Bancorp 34 has routine
cash outlays consisting primarily of operating expenses and debt service. Bancorp 34 can obtain funding to meet its obligations from
dividends collected from its subsidiary, Southwest Heritage Bank, and through the issuance of varying forms of debt and equity. At September
30, 2024, Bancorp 34 had cash and equivalents of 3.8 million, a 1.5 million note receivable from the Southwest Heritage Bank ESOP,
and debt outstanding of 27.7 million, which includes 5.2 million related to trust preferred debt assumed in connection with the CBOA
Merger. Management believes Bancorp 34 has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its requirements
in the short-term and the long-term. 

Federal banking laws
regulate dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval. Southwest Heritage Bank may declare dividends without
prior regulatory approval that do not exceed the total of retained net income for the current year combined with its retained net income
for the preceding two years, subject to maintenance of minimum capital requirements. Prior regulatory approval to pay dividends was not
required in 2022 or 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Southwest Heritage Bank did not pay a dividend to Bancorp
34. 

Southwest
Heritage Bank (the Bank) 

Southwest Heritage
Bank s liquidity management policy and our asset and liability management policy, or ALM policy, provides the framework that we
use to seek to maintain adequate liquidity and sources of available liquidity at levels that will enable us to meet all reasonably foreseeable
short-term, long-term, and strategic liquidity demands. Our Asset and Liability Management Committee, or ALCO, is responsible for oversight
of our liquidity risk management activities in accordance with the provisions of our ALM Policy and applicable bank regulatory capital
and liquidity laws and regulations. Our liquidity risk management process includes (i) ongoing analysis and monitoring of our funding
requirements under various economic and interest rate scenarios, (ii) review and monitoring of lenders, depositors, brokers and other
liability holders to ensure appropriate diversification of funding sources, and (iii) liquidity contingency planning to address liquidity
needs in the event of unforeseen market disruption, including appropriate allocation of funds to a liquid portfolio of marketable securities
and investments. We continuously monitor our liquidity position in order for our assets and liabilities to be managed in a manner that
we believe will meet our immediate and long-term funding requirements. We seek to manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash
flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return-on-investment objectives
of our stockholders. We also monitor our liquidity requirements in light of interest rate trends, changes in the economy, and the scheduled
maturity and interest rate sensitivity of our securities, loan portfolios and deposits. Liquidity management is made more complicated
because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control. For example, the timing of maturities
of our investment portfolio is fairly predictable and subject to a high degree of control when we make investment decisions. 

64 

Our liquidity
position is supported by management of our liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Our short-term and
long-term liquidity requirements are primarily to fund on-going operations, including payment of interest on deposits and debt, extensions
of credit to borrowers and capital expenditures. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through our deposits, FHLB advances,
subordinated debt and the principal and interest payments we receive on loans and investment securities. Cash, interest-bearing deposits
in third party banks, securities available-for-sale and maturing or prepaying balances in our investment and loan portfolios are our
most liquid assets. Other sources of liquidity that are available to us include the sale of loans we hold for investment, the ability
to acquire additional national market non-core deposits, borrowings through the Federal Reserve s discount window and the issuance
of additional debt. 

 At September 30, 2024,
Southwest Heritage Bank s cash and cash equivalents were 127.8 million, or 13.6 of Southwest Heritage Bank s total assets,
compared to 28.9 million, or 5.0 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The increase in Southwest Heritage Bank s liquid
assets, during nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflects cash acquired in the CBOA Merger, proceeds from the sale of the marked
investment portfolio acquired in the CBOA Merger, and loan payoffs. These cash increases were partially offset by the decline in deposit
balances and the payoff of borrowings since the CBOA Merger. 

The liability portion
of our balance sheet serves as a primary source of liquidity. We plan to meet our future cash needs primarily through the generation
of deposits. Customer deposits have historically provided a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. At September 30,
2024, net loans as a percentage of deposits were 87.8 , compared to 98.1 at December 31, 2023. For additional information related
to our deposits, see the Deposits section above. 

As of September 30,
2024, we also had borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank FRB of San Francisco and the FHLB of San Francisco,
from which we can borrow for leverage or liquidity purposes. Both the FRB and FHLB require that securities and/or qualifying loans be
pledged to secure any advances. At September 30, 2024, Southwest Heritage Bank had: (i) 27 million in advances from the FRB s
BTFP; (ii) 29.2 million in availability through the FRB s Discount Window; (iii) 229.4 million in borrowing capacity at the FHLB
of San Francisco; and (iv) fully available unsecured Federal funds lines-of-credit with certain other financial institutions totaling
 49.8 million. 

In October 2024, the
Bank paid off in full its 27 million BTFP borrowing from the FRB and transferred the related pledged available-for-sale
securities of 27.6 million, securing this BTFP borrowing, to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco s Discount Window. In addition,
 990,000 of accrued interest payable was paid off in connection with the October 2024 full pay off of the BTFP borrowing described above. 

Management believes
Southwest Heritage Bank has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its requirements in the short-term
and long-term. 

Capital
Resources 

Our consolidated stockholders 
equity at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was 87.1 million and 60.7 million, respectively. This increase primarily reflects
the 23.3 million estimated fair value of our 2.7 million common shares issued as consideration in connection with the CBOA Merger in
March 2024. 

We are subject to various
regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate
certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by federal banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct
material effect on our financial statements. 

65 

Regulatory capital
rules adopted in July 2013 and fully phased in as of January 1, 2019, which we refer to as the Basel III rules, impose minimum capital
requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The Basel III rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations
regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with consolidated assets of more than 3 billion.
While Bancorp 34 is not subject to the regulation, the ratios are monitored by management should compliance be required. 

To avoid restrictions
on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain the fully phased
in capital conservation buffer of 2.5 on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist
solely of common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (common equity Tier 1 risk-based
capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital). At September 30, 2024, Southwest Heritage Bank exceeded the regulatory minimums and
met the regulatory definition of well-capitalized.

Off-Balance
Sheet Items 

We are a party to financial
instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial
instruments include commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements
of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The contractual
or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments. 

Commitments to extend
credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are
expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We
evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by us
upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral is primarily obtained in the
form of commercial and residential real estate, including income producing commercial properties. 

Commitments to make
loans are generally made for periods of 90 days or less. 

Our exposure to credit
loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters
of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments
and conditional obligations as for funded instruments. We do not anticipate any material losses as a result of the commitments and standby
letters of credit.

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

 Not
required of smaller reporting companies. 

 Item 4.
Controls and Procedures 

The Company s
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September
30, 2024. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

 During the quarter
ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection
with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continually
monitors and assesses changes in processes and activities to determine any potential impact on the design and operating effectiveness
of internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II 
OTHER INFORMATION 

 Item 1.
Legal Proceedings 

 The Company
and the Bank are defendants, from time-to-time, in legal actions at various points of the legal process arising from transactions conducted
in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that, after consultation with legal counsel, it is not probable that the outcome
of current legal actions will result in a liability that would have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial
position, results of operations, comprehensive income or cash flows. In the event that such a legal action results in an unfavorable
outcome, the resulting liability could have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results
of operations, comprehensive income or cash flows. 

 Item 1A.
Risk Factors 

 In addition
to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I 
Item 1A Risk Factors of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could
materially affect its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or future results. Please be aware that these
risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict
such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or the trading
price of our securities. Subject to the foregoing, there have been no material changes from risk factors as previously disclosed in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, except as otherwise disclosed herein. 

 Item 2.
