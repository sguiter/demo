 The Company performs impairment testing of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of December 31 of each year and on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that its indefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired.

 2026 Credit Agreement (Term Loan due 2026) 
 On September 26, 2019, the Company entered into a credit agreement by and among Cumulus Media Intermediate, Inc. ("Intermediate Holdings"), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Cumulus Media New Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Holdings"), certain other subsidiaries of the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the other banks and financial institutions party thereto as Lenders (the "2026 Credit Agreement"). Pursuant to the 2026 Credit Agreement, the lenders party thereto provided Holdings and its subsidiaries that are party thereto as co-borrowers with a million senior secured Term Loan (the "Term Loan due 2026"), which was used to refinance the remaining balance of the then outstanding term loan (the "Term Loan due 2022"). On June 9, 2023, Intermediate Holdings and certain of the Company's other subsidiaries (collectively, with Holdings and Intermediate Holdings, the ("Credit Parties") entered into a second amendment ("Amendment No. 2") to the 2026 Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 2, among other things, modifies certain terms of the Term Loan due 2026 to replace the relevant benchmark provisions from the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). 
 Prior to the execution of Amendment No. 2, amounts outstanding under the 2026 Credit Agreement bore interest at a per annum rate equal to (i) the London Inter-bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus an applicable margin of , subject to a LIBOR floor of , or (ii) the Alternative Base Rate (as defined below) plus an applicable margin of , subject to an Alternative Base Rate floor of . The Alternative Base Rate is defined, for any day, as the per annum rate equal to the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 1/2 of 1.0 , (ii) the rate identified by Bank of America, N.A. as its "Prime Rate" and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus . Subsequent to the execution of Amendment No. 2, amounts outstanding under the 2026 Credit Agreement bore interest at a per annum rate equal to (i) SOFR plus a SOFR Adjustment, subject to a SOFR floor of , and an applicable margin of , or (ii) the Alternative Base Rate. As of September 30, 2024, the Term Loan due 2026 bore interest at a rate of per annum. 
 Amounts outstanding under the Term Loan due 2026 amortize in equal quarterly installments of of the original principal amount of the Term Loan due 2026 with the balance payable on the maturity date. As a result of the mandatory prepayments, the Company is no longer required to make such quarterly installments. The maturity date of the Term Loan due 2026 is March 31, 2026. 
 In connection with the Term Loan Exchange Offer (as defined below), Holdings also solicited consents from lenders of the Term Loan due 2026 to make certain proposed amendments to the 2026 Credit Agreement which eliminated substantially all restrictive covenants, eliminated certain events of default, subordinated the liens on the collateral to the liens securing the Term Loan due 2029 and the Senior Notes due 2029 and modified or eliminated certain other provisions. After receiving the requisite consents, on May 2, 2024, Holdings entered into an exchange agreement effectuating such amendment. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repaid million principal amount of the Term Loan due 2026. The repayment resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of million. The Term Loan due 2026 was repaid with cash on hand. The Company wrote-off debt issuance costs as a result of the repayment which were not material. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all required covenants under the 2026 Credit Agreement. 
 2029 Credit Agreement (Term Loan Due 2029) 
 On May 2, 2024, Holdings completed its previously announced offer (the "Term Loan Exchange Offer" and, together with the Notes Exchange Offer, the "Exchange Offer") to exchange its Term Loan due 2026, for new senior secured term loans due May 2, 2029 (the "Term Loan due 2029") issued under a new credit agreement. In connection with the Term Loan Exchange Offer, Holdings exchanged million in aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan due 2026 for million in aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan due 2029. After giving effect to the Term Loan Exchange Offer, including fees and expenses, as of May 2, 2024, there was million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under Term Loan due 2026 and million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan due 2029. 
 Upon consummation of the Term Loan Exchange Offer, Holdings entered into a new term loan credit agreement (the "2029 Credit Agreement"), by and among Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, certain other subsidiaries of the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the other banks and financial institutions party thereto as lenders. The maturity

 , and an applicable margin of , or (ii) the Alternative Base (as defined therein) and an applicable margin of . Subject to certain exceptions, the 2029 Credit Agreement has substantially similar representations and events of default as the 2026 Credit Agreement has (prior to giving effect to the Term Loan Exchange Offer). As of September 30, 2024, the Term Loan due 2029 bore interest at a rate of per annum. 
 The 2029 Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions as well as various affirmative, negative and financial covenants that, among other things, may restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or repurchase stock. The Term Loan due 2029 and related guarantees are secured by first-priority (with respect to the Term Loan Priority Collateral (as defined in the 2029 Credit Agreement)) and second-priority (with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral (as defined in the 2029 Credit Agreement)) security interests in, subject to permitted liens and certain exceptions, substantially all of the existing and future assets of Holdings and the Existing Guarantors, which assets also secure the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement (as defined below) and the Senior Notes due 2029 and do not secure the Senior Notes due 2026. In addition, the Term Loan due 2029 is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries that are designated as unrestricted under the Term Loan due 2026 and the Senior Notes due 2026 and secured by first-priority security interests in, subject to permitted liens and certain exceptions, the assets of such subsidiaries. The Senior Notes due 2026 and Term Loan due 2026 do not have the benefit of such additional guarantees and collateral. 
 The exchange was accounted for as a modification resulting in a prospective yield adjustment, in accordance with ASC 470-50, and the carrying value was not changed. The million difference between the carrying value of exchanged Term Loan due 2026 and Term Loan due 2029, as well as previously deferred issuance costs, will be amortized over the term of the Term Loan due 2029 utilizing the effective interest method (thereby reducing interest expense). Previously deferred issuance costs for the Term Loan due 2026 that were not exchanged were not material and written off at the time of the exchange. As the Term Loan Exchange Offer was accounted for as a modification, fees paid to third-parties were expensed. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all required covenants under the 2029 Credit Agreement. 
 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement 
 On March 6, 2020, Holdings and certain of the Company s other subsidiaries, as borrowers (the "Borrowers"), and Intermediate Holdings entered into a million revolving credit facility (the "2020 Revolving Credit Facility") pursuant to a Credit Agreement (the "2020 Revolving Credit Agreement"), dated as of March 6, 2020, with Fifth Third Bank, as a lender and Administrative Agent and certain other lenders from time to time party thereto. On May 2, 2024, the Borrowers and Intermediate Holdings entered into a sixth amendment (the "Sixth Amendment") to the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement which, among other things, (i) extended the maturity date of all borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility to March 1, 2029, provided, that if any indebtedness for borrowed money of Holdings or one of its restricted subsidiaries with an aggregate principal amount in excess of the lesser of (A) million and (B) the greater of (x) million and (y) the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the 2026 Credit Agreement and the 2026 Notes Indenture (as defined below) is outstanding on the date that is days prior to the stated maturity of such indebtedness (each such date, a "Springing Maturity Date"), then the Initial Maturity Date shall instead be such Springing Maturity Date, and (ii) increased the aggregate commitments under the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement to million. Except as modified by the Sixth Amendment, the existing terms of the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement remained in effect. 
 Availability under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility is tied to a borrowing base equal to of the accounts receivable of the Borrowers, subject to customary reserves and eligibility criteria and reduced by outstanding letters of credit. Under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility, up to million of availability may be drawn in the form of letters of credit and up to million of availability may be drawn in the form of swing line loans. 
 Borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at the option of Holdings, based on SOFR plus (i) and (ii) a percentage spread of or the Alternative Base Rate. The Alternative Base Rate is defined, for any day, as the per annum rate equal to the rate identified as the "Prime Rate" by Fifth Third Bank. In addition, the unused portion of the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to a commitment fee of . 
 As of September 30, 2024, million was outstanding under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility, representing letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, Holdings was in compliance with all required covenants under the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement.

 aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured First-Lien Notes due 2026 (the "Senior Notes due 2026"). The Senior Notes due 2026 were issued on June 26, 2019. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes due 2026 were applied to partially repay existing indebtedness under the Term Loan due 2022. In conjunction with the issuance of the Senior Notes due 2026, debt issuance costs of million were capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the Senior Notes due 2026. 
 Interest on the Senior Notes due 2026 is payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing on January 1, 2020. The Senior Notes due 2026 mature on July 1, 2026. 
 In connection with the Notes Exchange Offer (as defined below), Holdings solicited consents from holders of the Senior Notes due 2026 to certain proposed amendments to the 2026 Notes Indenture (such amendments, the "Proposed Amendments"), which, among other things, eliminated substantially all restrictive covenants, eliminated certain events of default, modified or eliminated certain other provisions, and released all the collateral securing the Senior Notes due 2026. As a result of receiving consents from holders representing over 66 2/3 of the Senior Notes due 2026, Holdings entered into the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 2, 2024, between Holdings and the U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee, containing such Proposed Amendments. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid million principal amount of the Senior Notes due 2026. The repayment resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of million. The Senior Notes due 2026 were repaid with cash on hand. The Company wrote-off debt issuance costs as a result of the repayment which were not material. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repaid million principal amount of the Senior Notes due 2026. The repayments resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of million. The Senior Notes due 2026 were repaid with cash on hand. The Company wrote-off million of debt issuance costs as a result of the repayment. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Holdings was in compliance with all required covenants under the Indenture. 
 Senior Notes due 2029 
 On May 2, 2024, Holdings consummated its previously announced offer (the "Notes Exchange Offer") to exchange any and all of its outstanding Senior Notes due 2026 for new Senior Secured First-Lien Notes due 2029 (the "Senior Notes due 2029"). In connection with the Notes Exchange Offer, Holdings accepted million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2026 tendered in the Notes Exchange Offer in exchange for million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2029. After giving effect to the Notes Exchange Offer, including fees and expenses, as of May 2, 2024, there was million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2026 outstanding and million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2029 outstanding. 
 The Senior Notes due 2029 were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the "2029 Notes Indenture"), dated as of May 2, 2024, by and among Holdings, the guarantors party thereto, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2029 is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2024. The Senior Notes due 2029 mature on July 1, 2029. Holdings may redeem the Senior Notes due 2029, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. 
 The Senior Notes due 2029 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Intermediate Holdings and the present and future wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries of Holdings (the "Senior Notes Guarantors"), subject to the terms of the 2029 Notes Indenture. Other than certain assets secured on a first priority basis under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility (as to which the Senior Notes due 2029 are secured on a second-priority basis), the Senior Notes due 2029 and related guarantees are secured on a first-priority basis pari passu with the Term Loan due 2029 (subject to certain exceptions) by liens on substantially all of the assets of the Holdings and the Senior Notes Guarantors. 
 The 2029 Notes Indenture contains customary terms and conditions as well as various affirmative, negative and financial covenants that, among other things, may restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or repurchase stock. A default under the Senior Notes due 2029 could cause a default under the 2029 Credit Agreement. 
 The exchange was accounted for as a modification resulting in a prospective yield adjustment, in accordance with ASC 470-50, and the carrying value was not changed. The million difference between the carrying value of exchanged Senior Notes due 2026 and Senior Notes due 2029 will be amortized over the term of the Senior Notes due 2029 utilizing the effective interest method (thereby reducing interest expense). Previously deferred issuance costs for the Senior Notes due 2026 that were

 Shareholder Rights Plan 
 On February 21, 2024, our Board adopted a rights plan and declared a dividend of (a) Class A right (a "Class A Right") in respect of each share of the Company's Class A common stock, par value per share (the "Class A Common Shares") and (b) Class B right (a "Class B Right," and, together with the Class A Rights, the "Rights") in respect of each share of the Company's Class B common stock, par value per share (the "Class B Common Shares" and together with the Class A Common Shares, the "Common Shares"). The dividend distribution was made on March 4, 2024 to the Company's stockholders of record on that date. The terms of the Rights and the rights plan are set forth in a Stockholder Rights Agreement, dated as of February 21, 2024 (the "Rights Agreement"), by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, as rights agent (or any successor rights agent), as it may be amended from time to time. 
 In the event that a person or group that is or becomes the beneficial owner of or more of the Company's outstanding Class A Common Shares without prior approval of the Board, subject to certain exceptions (such person or group, an "Acquiring Person"), (a) each Class A Right would allow its holder to purchase from the Company one ten-thousandth of a Class A Common Share for a purchase price of and (b) each Class B Right would allow its holder to purchase from the Company one ten-thousandth of a Class B Common Share for a purchase price of . Prior to exercise, a Right does not give its holder any dividend, voting or liquidation rights. 
 After the date that the Rights become exercisable (the "Distribution Date"), if a person or group is or becomes an Acquiring Person, all holders of Rights, except the Acquiring Person, may exercise their (a) Class A Rights, upon payment of the applicable purchase price, to purchase Class A Common Shares (or other securities or assets as determined by the Board) with a market value of times the applicable purchase price, and (b) Class B Rights, upon payment of the applicable purchase price, to purchase Class B Common Shares (or other securities or assets as determined by the Board) with a market value of two times the applicable purchase price. After the date that the Rights become exercisable, if a flip-in event has already occurred and the Company is acquired in a merger or similar transaction, all holders of Rights, except such Acquiring Person, may exercise their Rights, upon payment of the purchase price, to purchase shares of the acquiring corporation with a market value of two times the applicable purchase price of the Rights. 
 In addition, after the later of the Distribution Date and the date of the Company's first public announcement that a person or group has become an Acquiring Person, the Board may exchange each Right (other than Rights that have become null and void) at an exchange ratio of (a) Class A Common Share per Class A Right and (b) Class B Common Share per Class B Right. The Board may redeem all (but not less than all) of the Rights for a redemption price of per Right at any time before the date of the Company's first public announcement or disclosure that a person or group has become an Acquiring Person.

 will be made. Before the time Rights cease to be redeemable, the Board may amend or supplement the Rights Agreement without the consent of the holders of the Rights, except that no amendment may decrease the Redemption Price below per Right. At any time thereafter, the Board may amend or supplement the Rights Agreement to cure an ambiguity, to alter time period provisions, to correct inconsistent provisions or to make any additional changes to the Rights Agreement, to the extent that those changes do not impair or adversely affect any Rights holder and do not result in the Rights again becoming redeemable. The limitations on the Board s ability to amend the Rights Agreement do not affect the Board s power or ability to take any other action that is consistent with its fiduciary duties and the terms of the Rights Agreement, including without limitation, accelerating or extending the Expiration Date of the Rights, making any amendment to the Rights Agreement that is permitted by the Rights Agreement or adopting a new Rights Agreement with such terms as the Board determines in its sole discretion to be appropriate. Unless earlier redeemed or exchanged, the Rights will expire on February 20, 2025. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On May 4, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the "Prior Share Repurchase Authorization") for up to million of outstanding Class A common stock. Under the Prior Share Repurchase Authorization, on May 12, 2023, the Company commenced a modified Dutch tender offer to purchase up to million of shares of its Class A common stock at a price not greater than and not less than per share of Class A common stock, to the tendering shareholder in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest (the "2023 Offer"). The 2023 Offer expired on June 9, 2023. Through the 2023 Offer, the Company accepted for payment a total of shares of the Company's Class A Common stock at a purchase price of per share, for an aggregate cost of approximately million, excluding fees and expenses.The Prior Share Repurchase Authorization expired on November 3, 2023. 
 On October 27, 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the "Current Share Repurchase Authorization") for up to million of outstanding Class A common stock. The Current Share Repurchase Authorization superseded and replaced our Prior Share Repurchase Authorization, and expires on May 15, 2025. Purchases made pursuant to the program may be made from time to time, at the Company s discretion, in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or through other manners as permitted by federal securities laws including, but not limited to, 10b5-1 trading plans, accelerated stock repurchase programs and tender offers. The extent that the Company repurchases its shares, the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases will depend on general economic and market conditions, regulatory and legal requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other considerations. The repurchase program does not require the Company to repurchase a minimum number of shares, and it may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. We are currently subject to significant restrictions under the terms of our debt agreements with respect to payment to repurchase shares of our common stock. See "Note 5 Long-Term Debt" for further discussion of the restrictions in our debt agreements. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its outstanding Class A Common stock in the open market. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased shares of its outstanding Class A common stock in the open market at an average purchase price of per share for an aggregate cost of approximately million, excluding fees and expenses. Shares repurchased were accounted for as treasury stock, and the total cost of shares repurchased was recorded as a reduction of stockholder's equity in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was enacted into law on August 16, 2022, imposed a nondeductible 1 excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. Excise tax is owed on the fair market value of stock repurchases reduced by the fair market value of stock issued, subject to a 1,000,000 de minimis exception. Excise tax owed on shares repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was not material. 
 million of the Company's outstanding Class A common stock remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase program , subject to restrictions under the terms of our debt agreements.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this Form 10-Q, including our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, as well as our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 ("2023 Form 10-K"), filed with the SEC. This discussion, as well as various other sections of this Form 10-Q, contain and refer to statements that constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. Such statements are any statements other than those of historical fact and relate to our intent, belief or current expectations primarily with respect to our future operating, financial and strategic performance. Any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors," and elsewhere in our 2023 Form 10-K and elsewhere in this report, and those described from time to time in other reports filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ from those contained in or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. For more information, see "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 From time to time, we utilize certain financial measures that are not prepared or calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial performance and profitability. Consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") is a financial metric by which management and the chief operating decision maker allocate resources of the Company and analyze the performance of the Company as a whole. Management also uses this measure to determine the contribution of our core operations to the funding of our corporate resources utilized to manage our operations and our non-operating expenses including debt service and acquisitions. In addition, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric for purposes of calculating and determining our compliance with certain covenants contained in our credit agreements. 
 In determining Adjusted EBITDA, we exclude the following from net loss: interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gain or loss on the exchange, sale, or disposal of any assets or stations or early extinguishment of debt, restructuring costs, expenses relating to acquisitions and divestitures, non-routine legal expenses incurred in connection with certain litigation matters, and non-cash impairments of assets, if any. 
 Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, although not a measure that is calculated in accordance with GAAP, is commonly employed by the investment community as a measure for determining the market value of a media company and comparing the operational and financial performance among media companies. Management has also observed that Adjusted EBITDA is routinely utilized to evaluate and negotiate the potential purchase price for media companies. Given the relevance to our overall value, management believes that investors consider the metric to be extremely useful. 
 Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net (loss) income, operating income (loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining our operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be defined or calculated differently by other companies, and comparability may be limited.

 Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt 
 The gain on early extinguishment of debt for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 0.8 million was driven by the Company's repurchases of 5.2 million principal amount of the Term Loan due 2026. 
 Other Expense 
 Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was not material. 
 Income Tax Benefit

 Net Revenue 
 Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, decreased 14.7 million, or 2.4 . The decrease is primarily driven by reductions in spot and network revenues of 21.9 million and 4.3 million, respectively, as a result of current macroeconomic conditions. These decreases were primarily offset by 7.0 million of higher digital advertising revenue largely driven by growth in digital marketing services and a 4.5 million increase in other revenue primarily resulting from higher trade revenue. 
 Content Costs 
 Content costs consist of all costs related to the licensing, acquisition and development of our programming. Content costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to content costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, decreased 3.9 million, or 1.6 , primarily resulting from reductions in syndicated programming costs, third party station inventory, and music licensing fees, all driven by declining revenue. These decreases were partially offset by higher digital costs, which grew in line with digital advertising revenue.

These increases were partially offset by a 9.1 million impairment, recorded during the second quarter of 2023, for a certain lease which is expected to be sublet at an amount less than the current contractual agreement and lower incentive compensation expense resulting from Company performance. 
 Loss (Gain) on Sale or Disposal of Assets or Stations 
 The loss on sale or disposal of assets or stations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was not material. 
 The gain on sale or disposal of assets or stations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily related to the sales of WDRQ-FM and WFAS-FM.

 Interest Expense 
 Total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1.4 million, or 2.7 , when compared to the total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The below table details the components of our interest expense by debt instrument (dollars in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Term Loan due 2026 10,423 22,557 (12,134) Term Loan due 2029 13,554 13,554 Senior Notes due 2026 8,493 18,384 (9,891) Senior Notes due 2029 10,144 10,144 Financing liabilities 10,545 10,782 (237) Amortization of debt discount (2,261) (2,261) Other, including amortization and write-off of debt issuance costs 1,131 1,745 (614) Interest expense 52,029 53,468 (1,439) 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1.2 million, or 69.3 when compared to interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income decreased as a result of reduced investment in government money market funds during 2024 when compared to 2023. 
 Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt 
 The gain on early extinguishment of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 0.2 million was driven by the Company's repurchase of 0.5 million principal amount of the Senior Notes due 2026. 
 The gain on early extinguishment of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 9.8 million was primarily driven by the Company's repurchases of 34.7 million and 8.9 million principal amount of the 6.75 Senior Notes and Term Loan due 2026, respectively. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of 14.8 million, represents the gain recognized on the February 2024 sale of Broadcast Music, Inc. (the "BMI Sale") to a shareholder group led by New Mountain Capital, LLC. 
 Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was not material. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax expense of 2.2 million on pre-tax book loss of 49.9 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately (4.5) . For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of 0.6 million on pre-tax book loss of 20.4 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 2.8 . 
 The differences between the effective tax rates and the federal statutory rate of 21.0 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, primarily relate to the valuation allowance recognized during the year, changes to our projected full year effective tax rate, state and local income taxes, and the effect of certain statutory non-deductible expenses. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 As a result of the factors described above, Adjusted EBITDA of 57.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the Adjusted EBITDA of 67.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, decreased 10.3 million.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 52.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. The Company used 20.1 million of cash for operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and generated cash from operating activities of 28.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Historically, our principal sources of funds have been cash flow from operations and borrowings under credit facilities in existence from time to time. Our cash flow from operations remains subject to factors such as fluctuations in advertising media preferences and changes in demand caused by shifts in population, station listenership, demographics and audience tastes. In addition, our cash flows may be affected if customers are not able to pay, or delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us, which risks may also be exacerbated in challenging or otherwise uncertain economic periods. In certain periods, the Company has experienced reductions in revenue and profitability from prior historical periods because of market revenue pressures and cost escalations built into certain contracts. Notwithstanding this, we believe that our various content platforms, including an extensive number of local stations, national reach, and growing digital businesses, represent a broad diversity in format, listener base, geography, and advertiser base which help us maintain a more stable revenue stream by reducing our dependence on any single demographic, region or industry. However, future reductions in revenue or profitability 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 are possible and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
 We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, while others are considered future commitments. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, commitments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements, and employment and talent contracts. In addition to our contractual obligations, we expect that our primary anticipated uses of liquidity in 2024 will be to fund our working capital, make interest and tax payments, fund capital expenditures, execute our strategic plan and maintain operations. 
 Although there remains uncertainty related to the current macroeconomic conditions on the Company's future results, we believe our business model, our current cash reserves and borrowings from time to time under the Revolving Credit Agreement (or any such other credit facility as may be in place at the appropriate time) will help us manage our business and anticipated liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. 
 We continually monitor our capital structure, and from time to time, we have evaluated, and expect that we will continue to evaluate, opportunities to obtain additional capital from the divestiture of radio stations or other assets, when we determine that it would further our strategic and financial objectives, as well as from the issuance of equity and/or debt securities, in each case, subject to market and other conditions in existence at that time. There can be no assurance that any such financing would be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Future volatility in the capital and credit markets, caused by the current macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, may increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. In addition, it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets could be limited at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to refinance maturing debt on terms or at times acceptable to us, or at all, and/or react to changing economic and business conditions. 
 2026 Credit Agreement (Term Loan due 2026) 
 On September 26, 2019, Holdings entered into the 2026 Credit Agreement providing for the Term Loan due 2026. See Part I, "Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5 Long-Term Debt," for further discussion of the 2026 Credit Agreement. 
 2029 Credit Agreement (Term Loan Due 2029) 
 On May 2, 2024, Holdings completed its offer (the "Term Loan Exchange Offer" and, together with the Notes Exchange Offer, the "Exchange Offer") to exchange its Term Loan due 2026, for new senior secured term loans due May 2, 2029 (the "Term Loan due 2029") issued under a new credit agreement. In connection with the Term Loan Exchange Offer, Holdings exchanged 328.3 million in aggregate principal amount of its Term Loan due 2026 for 311.8 million in aggregate principal amount of Term Loan due 2029. 
 See Part I, "Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5 Long-Term Debt," for further discussion of the Term Loan Exchange Offer. 
 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement 
 On March 6, 2020, we entered into a 100.0 million Revolving Credit Facility which was amended on June 3, 2022 (and further amended on May 2, 2024, as discussed below). See Part I, "Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5 Long-Term Debt," for further discussion of our 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 On May 2, 2024, the Borrowers and Intermediate Holdings entered into the Sixth Amendment to the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement which, among other things, (i) extended the maturity date of all borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility to March 1, 2029, provided, that if any indebtedness for borrowed money of Holdings or one of its restricted subsidiaries with an aggregate principal amount in excess of the lesser of (A) 50.0 million and (B) the greater of (x) 35.0 million and (y) the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the 2026 Credit Agreement and the 2026 Notes Indenture is outstanding on the date that is 90 days prior to the stated maturity of such indebtedness (each such date, a "Springing Maturity Date"), then the Initial Maturity Date shall instead be such Springing Maturity Date, and (ii) increased the aggregate commitments under the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement to 125.0 million. Except as modified by the Sixth Amendment, the existing terms of the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement remained in effect. See Part I, "Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5 Long-Term Debt," for further discussion of the Sixth Amendment.

 Senior Notes due 2026 
 On June 26, 2019, we entered into an indenture under which the Senior Notes due 2026 were issued. See Part I, "Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5 Long-Term Debt," for further discussion of the indenture and the Senior Notes due 2026. 
 Senior Notes due 2029 
 On May 2, 2024, Holdings consummated its Notes Exchange Offer to exchange any and all of its outstanding Senior Notes due 2026 for new 8.00 Senior Secured First-Lien Notes due 2029 (the "Senior Notes due 2029"). In connection with the Notes Exchange Offer, Holdings accepted 323.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2026 tendered in the Notes Exchange Offer in exchange for approximately 306.4 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2029. See Part I, "Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5 Long-Term Debt," for further discussion of the Notes Exchange Offer. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On May 4, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the "Prior Share Repurchase Authorization") for up to 50.0 million of outstanding Class A common stock. The Prior Share Repurchase Authorization expired on November 3, 2023. On October 27, 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the "Current Share Repurchase Authorization") for up to 25.0 million of outstanding Class A common stock. The Current Share Repurchase Authorization superseded and replaced our Prior Share Repurchase Authorization, and expires on May 15, 2025. Purchases made pursuant to the program may be made from time to time, at the Company s discretion, in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or through other manners as permitted by federal securities laws including, but not limited to, 10b5-1 trading plans, accelerated stock repurchase programs and tender offers. The extent that the Company repurchases its shares, the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases will depend on general economic and market conditions, regulatory and legal requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other considerations. The repurchase program does not require the Company to repurchase a minimum number of shares, and it may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. We are currently subject to significant restrictions under the terms of our debt agreements with respect to payment to repurchase shares of our common stock. For a more detailed discussion of the restrictions in our debt agreements, See Part I, "Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5 Long-Term Debt." 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its outstanding Class A Common stock in the open market. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 323,285 shares of its outstanding Class A common stock in the open market at an average purchase price of 4.65 per share for an aggregate cost of approximately 1.5 million, excluding fees and expenses. Shares repurchased were accounted for as treasury stock and the total cost of shares repurchased was recorded as a reduction of stockholder's equity in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was enacted into law on August 16, 2022, imposed a nondeductible 1 excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. Excise tax is owed on the fair market value of stock repurchases reduced by the fair market value of stock issued, subject to a 1,000,000 de minimis exception. Excise tax owed on shares repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was not material. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 25.0 million of the Company's outstanding Class A common stock remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase program, subject to restrictions under the terms of our debt agreements. 
 Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities
