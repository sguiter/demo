Explanatory Note 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC allows us to incorporate by reference information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries as Comcast, we, us and our. 
 Numerical information in this report is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding. 

CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. These may include estimates, projections and statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, which are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by words such as believe, project, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, potential, strategy, future, opportunity, commit, plan, goal, may, should, could, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result and similar expressions. In evaluating forward-looking statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties we describe in the Risk Factors sections of our Forms 10-K and 10-Q and in other reports we file with the SEC. 
 Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: 
 our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively 
 changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models 
 a decline in advertisers expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses 
 our success depends on consumer acceptance of our content, and our businesses may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance 
 programming expenses for our video services are increasing on a per subscriber basis, which could adversely affect our video businesses 
 the loss of programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses 
 our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
 we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support 
 our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments 
 a cyber attack, information or security breach, or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations 
 weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses 
 acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated 
 we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses 
 natural disasters, severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations 
 the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses 
 labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses 
 we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses 
 unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures 

our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock

 Consolidated costs and expenses , excluding depreciation and amortization expense, increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily driven by increases in the Content Experiences business and Corporate and Other. Costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading Segment Operating Results. 
 Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to increased amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets related to the linear media business. Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by decreased depreciation of international property and equipment and decreased amortization of software. 
 Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled 817 million and 1.9 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 571 million and 1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011. 
 
 Consolidated interest expense decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and was consistent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to interest expense in the prior year periods associated with a collateralized obligation that was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023, offset by increases in average debt outstanding and higher weighted-average interest rates in the current year periods. 
 Consolidated investment and other income (loss), net decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023.

 The chang e in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net was primarily due to our investment in Atairos. The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income (loss) of (93) million and (289) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 252 million and 753 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. 
 The change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher losses on nonmarketable securities in the prior year period and losses on marketable securities in the prior year period. The change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher losses on marketable and nonmarketable securities in the current year period. 
 The increase in other income (loss), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from insurance contracts and foreign exchange remeasurement. 
 
 Consolidated income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The decreases in income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 were primarily driven by lower domestic income before income taxes. 
 Consolidated net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests changed f or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to our regional sports networks. The change for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by Universal Beijing Resort.

 (a) Our Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. The changes reflect the year-over-year basis point changes in the rounded Adjusted EBITDA margins. 
 (b) Constant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section on page 24 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of constant currency amounts. 
 
 We continue to focus on growing our higher-margin connectivity businesses while managing overall operating costs. We also continue to invest in our network to support higher-speed broadband offerings and to expand the number of homes and businesses passed. A competitive environment, which has increased in recent years, and continued low domestic household move levels have had negative impacts on our customer relationships additions/(losses). In addition, funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which provided a monthly discount towards broadband service for eligible low-income households, expired during the second quarter of 2024 and resulted in an estimated net loss of 96,000 residential domestic broadband customers for the third quarter of 2024. We believe our residential connectivity revenue will increase as a result of growth in average domestic broadband revenue per customer, as well as increases in domestic wireless and international connectivity revenue. At the same time, we expect continued declines in video revenue as a result of domestic customer net losses due to shifting video consumption patterns and the competitive environment, although customer net losses typically mitigate the impact of continued rate increases on programming expenses. We also expect continued declines in other revenue related to declines in wireline voice revenue. We believe our Business Services Connectivity segment will continue to grow by offering competitive services, including to medium-sized and enterprise customers. Global economic conditions and consumer sentiment have in the past adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, demand for our products and services and our results of operations.

 (a) Residential Connectivity Platforms customer relationships generally represent the number of residential customer locations that subscribe to at least one of our services. International Residential Connectivity Platforms customer relationships represent customers receiving Sky services in the United Kingdom and Italy. Because each of our services includes a variety of product tiers, which may change from time to time, net additions or losses in any one period will reflect a mix of customers at various tiers. 
 (b) Business Services Connectivity customer metrics are gener ally counted based on the number of locations receiving services, including locations within our network in the United States, as well as locations outside of our network both in the United States and internationally. Certain arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our network are also generally counted based on the number of locations served. 
 (c) Domestic wireless lines represent the number of residential and business customers wireless devices. An individual customer relationship may have multiple wireless lines. 
 (d) Connectivity Platforms domestic homes and businesses are considered passed if we can connect them to our network in the United States without further extending the transmission lines. Homes and businesses passed is an estimate based on the best available information. 
 (e) Penetration is calculated by dividing the number of domestic customers located within our network by the number of domestic homes and businesses passed.

 (a) Constant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section on page 24 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of constant currency amounts. 
 
 Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business customers, as well as changes in advertising and other revenue and in foreign currency exchange rates. While revenue from our individual service offerings is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business, and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses.

 We operate our Media segment as a combined television and streaming business. We expect that the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our linear television networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns, which we aim to mitigate over time by continued growth in paid subscribers and advertising revenue at Peacock. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to content and marketing at Peacock. Revenue and programming expenses are also impacted by the timing of certain sporting events, including the Olympics in the third quarter of 2024. Global economic conditions and consumer sentiment have in the past adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, demand for our products and services and our results of operations. 
 Our Studios segment generates revenue primarily from third parties and from licensing content to our Media segment. While results of operations for our Studios segment are not impacted, results for our total Content Experiences business may be impacted as the Studios segment licenses content to the Media segment, including for Peacock, rather than licensing the content to third parties. The Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists work stoppages from May to September 2023 and July to November 2023, respectively, resulted in reduced content licensing revenue and programming and production costs at our Studios segment in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including Epic Universe in Orlando, as well as in new destinations and experiences, which we believe will have a positive impact on attendance and guest spending at our theme parks.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.

Table of Contents 

 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. 
 We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP.

 Constant Currency 
 Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Connectivity Platforms, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Connectivity Platforms business, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the businesses, and we believe they are helpful for investors because such measures present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to allow the evaluation of their underlying performance. 
 Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current year period presented rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods.

 Our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cas h equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets, investing in business opportunities, and returning capital to shareholders. 
 We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Our commercial paper program generally provides a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled 11.8 billion. 
 We entered into a new revolving credit facility in May 2024 (see Note 5). Our new revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant pertaining to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to EBITDA, as defined in the agreement. Compliance with this financial covenant is tested on a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2024, we met this financial covenant, and we expect to remain in compliance with this financial covenant.

 The variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to increases in receivables and decreases in deferred revenue, which includes the impact of the Paris Olympics, the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including decreased spending in the prior year period due to the work stoppages and the timing of sports, and decreases in inventory. 
 The decrease in payments of interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to the payments of interest in the prior year period associated with our collateralized obligation which was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by increased debt balances following debt issuances in the current year period and higher weighted-average interest rates. 
 Payments of income taxes increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and included higher payments in the current year period related to the preceding tax year, primarily driven by the sale of our investment in Hulu. Payments were also impacted by the timing of transferable tax credit purchases. 
 In July 2024, we entered into new rights agreements with the NBA and WNBA for television and streaming rights for certain regular and post-season games beginning with the 2025-26 season through the 2035-36 season with aggregate rights payments of 27 billion. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily du e to de creased capital expenditures, decreased cash paid for intangible assets related to software development and increased proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments in the current year period. Capital expenditures decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily reflecting decreased spending by the Connectivity Platforms businesses driven by customer premise equipment and scalable infrastructure, partially offset by increased spending on line extensions; as well capital expenditures in the prior year period associated with the acquisition of land for potential theme park expansion opportunities. These decreases were partially offset by increased spending on theme park attractions. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu and received 8.6 billion, representing 9.2 billion for our share of Hulu s minimum equity value presented as an advance on the sale of our investment in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, less 557 million for our share of prior capital calls. We expect to receive additional proceeds for the sale of our interest in Hulu following the final determination of Hulu s fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process, at which time we will recognize the sale of our interest. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to de creases in repurchases of common stock in the current year period, repayments of short-term borrowings in the prior year period, higher repurchases and repayments of debt in the prior year period and higher proceeds from borrow ings in the current year period.

 We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outst an ding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. In particular, we may repurchase varying amounts of our outstanding public notes and debentures with short to medium term maturities through privately negotiated or market transactions. See Notes 5 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities. 
 Share Repurchases and Dividends 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased a total of 162 million shares of our Class A common stock for 6.6 billion. In January 2024, our Board of Directors terminated the existing share repurchase program authorization and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of 15.0 billion, which has no expiration date. As of September 30, 2024, we had 9.0 billion re maining under the authorization. W e expect to repurchase additional shares of our Class A common stock under this new authorization in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market and other conditions. 
 In addition, we paid 328 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. 
 In January 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 6.9 increase in our dividend to 1.24 per share on an annualized basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid dividends of 3.6 billion. In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved our third quarter dividend of 0.31 per share, which was paid in October 2024. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directo r s. 
 Guarantee Structure 
 Our debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt.

 Cross-Guarantees 
 Comcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the Guarantors fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. 
 The Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of 81 billion and 136 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of 19 billion and 18 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. 
 One-Way Guarantees 
 Comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky Limited Sky , including all of its senior notes, and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC.

 Comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of 138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis, and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100 and approximately 37 of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of 47 billion and 104 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of 15 billion and 14 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt, and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 We believe our estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We performed a quantitative assessment as of July 1, 2024 for goodwill in our Media segment. Based on this assessment, the estimated fair value of the Media reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and no impairment was required. 
 Changes in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge. 
 For a more complete discussion of the accounting estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Our principal executive and principal financial officers, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report, have concluded that, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
