U.S. Treasuries held at September 30, 2024 and U.S. Treasuries held at December 31, 2023 were classified as available-for-sale securities. The Company classifies U.S. Treasuries with stated maturities of greater than three months and less than one year in short-term investments. U.S. Treasuries with stated maturities greater than one year are classified as non-current investments in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company records available-for-sale securities at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (in stockholders equity). Realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold. Interest income (expense) is recognized when earned and is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The Company recognizes a charge when the declines in the fair value below the amortized cost basis of its available-for-sale securities are judged to be as a result of a credit loss. The Company considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an allowance for credit losses including whether the Company intends to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis. If the unrealized loss of an available-for-sale debt security is determined to be a result of a credit loss the Company would recognize an allowance and the corresponding credit loss would be included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The Company has not recorded an allowance for credit loss on its available-for-sale securities. See Note 3 (Investments).

 Reserves for Variable Consideration: Revenue from product sales is recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established. Components of variable consideration include trade discounts and allowances, prompt payment discounts, product returns, provider chargebacks and discounts, government rebates, payor rebates, and other incentives, such as voluntary patient assistance, and other allowances that are offered within contracts between the Company and its customers relating to the Company s sale of its products. These reserves, as detailed below, are based on the amounts earned, or to be claimed on the related sales, and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to its customers) or a current liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than its customers). These estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes which are probability-weighted in accordance with the expected value method in Topic 606 for relevant factors such as current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect the Company s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the respective underlying contracts. The amount of variable consideration which is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur in a future period. The Company s analyses also contemplates application of the constraint in accordance with the guidance, under which it determined a material reversal of revenue would not occur in a future period for the estimates detailed below as of September 30, 2024 and, therefore, the transaction price was not reduced further during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company s estimates. If actual results in the future vary from the Company s estimates, the Company will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.

from receipt of the notice letters to commence patent infringement lawsuits against these generic drug manufacturers in a federal district court to trigger a stay precluding the FDA from approving any ANDA until May 2026 or entry of judgment holding the patents invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, whichever occurs first. In that regard, after conducting the necessary due diligence, the Company filed lawsuits on March 1, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against each of the three generic drug manufacturers who notified the Company of their ANDA submissions, thus triggering the stay. In June 2024, Lupin converted five of its Paragraph IV Certifications in its ANDA to Paragraph III certifications acknowledging the validity and their ANDA s infringement of five of those patents, the latest ending in 2034. The Company subsequently dismissed all of its claims against Lupin related to those five patents but maintains its claims against Lupin for the remaining Paragraph IV certification for United States Patent No. 10,626,088 which is the patent expiring in 2037, so the litigation continues. Further, the litigation with Teva and Hetero continues with respect to all six patents. Further, in October 2023, the Company received a Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letter from a fourth generic drug manufacturer (Inventia), and the Company filed a similar lawsuit against that manufacturer in November 2023. On July 30, 2024, the Company settled its patent litigation with Inventia for FIRDAPSE . In that settlement, Inventia acknowledged both the validity of the Company's FIRDAPSE patents and also the infringement by the ANDA filer's product of the Company's patents. As part of the settlement, Inventia also agreed not to commercialize its product until the earlier of all FIRDAPSE patents expiration scheduled for February 2037, or the earlier entry into the market of another ANDA product meeting certain conditions. The outcome of patent litigation with Paragraph IV challengers is always uncertain and there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this litigation. However, the Company is vigorously defending its intellectual property for FIRDAPSE in this litigation and believes that its patent estate will protect FIRDAPSE from generic competition for the life of its patents. On February 20, 2023, the Company received a Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letter from a company that appears to have filed the first ANDA for the oral suspension formulation for FYCOMPA . The same company sent a similar letter to the Company later in February with a similar certification for the tablet formulation for FYCOMPA , the fourth such certification for this formulation. Both of these letters were paragraph IV certifications of non-infringement, non-validity, and unenforceability to the 497 patent for FYCOMPA but each application, like the previous Paragraph IV notices from ANDA filers, for FYCOMPA tablets does not challenge the 571 patent. Similar to the actions with the FIRDAPSE Paragraph IV Certifications described above, after due diligence the Company filed lawsuits on April 5, 2023, in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the drug manufacturer who notified the Company of their ANDA submissions for both FYCOMPA formulations, thus triggering the 30-month stay for each application. This lawsuit was settled in June 2024. As part of this settlement, this Paragraph IV filer agreed not to commercialize their proposed ANDA products for both the oral suspension formulation of FYCOMPA and for FYCOMPA tablets until at least December 15, 2025. Additionally, from time to time the Company may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Except as set forth above, the Company believes that there is no other litigation pending at this time that could have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

, the Company entered into a license agreement with BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. (BioMarin) for the North American rights to FIRDAPSE . Under the license agreement, the Company pays: (i) royalties to the licensor for seven years from the first commercial sale of FIRDAPSE equal to of net sales (as defined in the license agreement) in North America for any calendar year for sales up to million, and of net sales in North America in any calendar year in excess of million; and (ii) royalties to the third-party licensor of the rights sublicensed to the Company for from the first commercial sale of FIRDAPSE equal to of net sales (as defined in the license agreement between BioMarin and the third-party licensor) in any calendar year for the duration of any regulatory exclusivity within a territory and for territories in any calendar year in territories without regulatory exclusivity. 

 On May 29, 2019, the Company and BioMarin entered into an amendment to the Company s license agreement for FIRDAPSE . Under the amendment, the Company has expanded its commercial territory for FIRDAPSE , which originally was comprised of North America, to include Japan. Additionally, the Company s commercial territory will be expanded under the license agreement to include most of Asia, as well as Latin America, upon the acceptance by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) of a Japan MAA for FIRDAPSE for LEMS. Under the amendment, the Company will pay royalties to its licensor on net sales in Japan of a similar percentage to the royalties that the Company is currently paying under its original license agreement for North America. On December 18, 2023, DyDo filed a Japan NDA with the PMDA, which was accepted for filing upon its submission. As a result, the Company s territory automatically expanded on that date to include most of Asia and Latin America. In January 2020, the Company was advised that BioMarin has transferred substantially all of its rights under the license agreement to SERB S.A., and SERB S.A. is now the Company s licensor under the license agreement. b. LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR RUZURGI . On (the Effective Date), the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Jacobus Pharmaceutical Company, Inc. (Jacobus), for the rights to develop and commercialize RUZURGI in the U.S. and Mexico. 

 Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, the Company paid Jacobus a million up-front payment on the Effective Date and also paid an additional million on the first annual anniversary of the Effective Date (July 11, 2023). The Company paid the final million installment on the second annual anniversary of the Effective Date (July 11, 2024). The Company is also obligated to pay tiered royalty payments on net sales (as defined in the license agreement) of all of the Company s amifampridine products in the U.S. that range from to based on whether there is a competing product or generic version of FIRDAPSE being marketed or sold in the U.S. A minimum royalty payment exists annually for calendar years from the Effective Date through 2025 of million, provided that such minimum annual royalty payment shall be prorated in the first calendar year of the agreement. As these minimum payments are both probable and estimable, they are included in the purchase price of the agreement and any royalties in excess of this amount will be charged to cost of sales as revenue from product sales is recognized. A minimum royalty payment exists annually for calendar years from 2026 through the expiration of the royalty term (which ends when there is no valid claim under the Company s FIRDAPSE patents in the U.S.) of million unless a competing product or generic version of FIRDAPSE is being marketed or sold in the U.S. If these minimum payments become probable in the future, the Company would recognize a contingent liability at that time with an offset to the value of the intangible asset acquired. Any royalties in excess of this amount will be charged to cost of sales as revenue from product sales is recognized. Royalties over the minimum, if any, will be paid based on the agreement terms on a quarterly basis. Assets acquired as part of the license agreement include among other intellectual property rights, Jacobus U.S. patents related to RUZURGI , its new drug applications in the U.S. for RUZURGI , its U.S. Trademark for RUZURGI , the Orphan Drug Designation for RUZURGI and a license from Jacobus for use of its know-how related to the manufacture of RUZURGI . Additionally, the Company also purchased from Jacobus approximately million of RUZURGI inventory previously manufactured by Jacobus, which was recorded as an expense in research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for 2022.

On , the Company acquired the U.S. Rights for FYCOMPA (perampanel) CIII a commercial stage epilepsy asset, from Eisai. The aggregate consideration for the acquisition was million in cash, including the reimbursement of certain liabilities and the payment of transaction costs. 

 Eisai was eligible to receive a contingent payment of million if a certain regulatory milestone was met. As meeting the regulatory milestone was not probable, the Company did not recognize any amount related to the milestone payments in the purchase price. Additionally, after the loss of patent exclusivity for FYCOMPA , the Company may be obligated to pay certain royalties to Eisai on net sales of FYCOMPA . As the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition under U.S. GAAP, the Company will recognize the royalty payments in cost of sales as revenue from product sales is recognized. Royalties commencing on loss of exclusivity for each calendar year during the royalty term equal to on net sales greater than million and less than million, on net sales of greater than million and less than million and on net sales greater than million prior to the date of generic entry. Royalties equal to on net sales greater than million and less than million, on net sales of greater than million and less than million and on net sales greater than million after the date of generic entry.

The straight-line method is used to amortize the license and acquired intangibles, as disclosed in Note 9 (License and Acquired Intangibles, Net). d. LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR AGAMREE (VAMOROLONE). In July 2023, the Company completed its acquisition from Santhera of an exclusive license for North America for AGAMREE (vamorolone), a treatment for patients suffering with DMD which was approved by the FDA on October 26, 2023. On March 13, 2024, the Company announced the U.S. commercial launch of AGAMREE for the treatment of DMD in patients aged two years or older. The license is for exclusive commercial rights in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, as well as the right of first negotiation in Europe and Japan should Santhera pursue partnership opportunities in those jurisdictions. Additionally, the Company will hold North American rights for any future approved indications of AGAMREE . The Company made an all-cash initial payment of million at the closing of the acquisition to acquire the license. 

 Under the license agreement, the Company pays: (i) royalties to the licensor until the later of expiration of product exclusivity or ten years from the first commercial sale of AGAMREE equal to of net sales (as defined in the license agreement) in North America for any calendar year for sales equal to or less than million (prior to December 31, 2025 only), of net sales for sales in excess of million and up to million, of net sales for sales in excess of million and up to million, of net sales for sales in excess of million; and (ii) royalties to the third-party licensor of the rights sublicensed to the Company until the later of expiration of product exclusivity or ten years from the first commercial sale of AGAMREE equal to of net sales (as defined in the license agreement) in North America for any single calendar year for sales equal to or less than million, of net sales for sales in excess of million and up to million, of net sales for sales in excess of million and up to million, of net sales for sales in excess of million and up to billion, of net sales for sales in excess of billion and up to billion and of net sales for sales in excess of billion. Furthermore, the Company may pay Santhera sales-based milestones of up to million as well as up to percent royalties for all additional indications and milestones of up to million for the first three additional indications. Simultaneously, the Company made a strategic equity investment into Santhera by acquiring of Santhera s post reverse-split ordinary shares (representing approximately of Santhera s outstanding ordinary shares immediately following the transaction), which are traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange, at an investment price of CHF per share (corresponding to a mutually agreed volume-weighted average price prior to signing), with the funds invested into Santhera to be used by Santhera for Phase IV studies in DMD and further development of additional indications for AGAMREE . The Company may also be obligated under certain circumstances to make milestone payments and to pay royalties to Santhera.

Transaction costs 

Total purchase consideration 

The transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-50. The Company accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition because substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset, the rights to develop, commercialize and manufacture AGAMREE . The AGAMREE rights consist of certain licenses and regulatory approvals and are considered a single asset as they are inextricably linked. ASC 805-10-55-5A includes a screen test, which provides that if substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the assets acquired are not considered to be a business. Additionally, the Company did not acquire a substantive process. ASC 805 requires the acquiring entity in an asset acquisition to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the cost to the acquiring entity on a relative fair value basis, which includes consideration given. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition and any excess consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to the non-financial assets based on relative fair values.

(i) of Santhera shares and the exchange rate of CHF to USD on the date the shares were transferred, July 19, 2023. 

 In accordance with FASB ASC 730-10-25, as AGAMREE (vamorolone) had not achieved regulatory approval when acquired, the portion of the purchase price allocated to the IPR D asset acquired (which includes all transaction costs related to the transactions with Santhera) was immediately expensed to research and development. Milestone payments made are either expensed as research and development or capitalized as a developed asset based on when regulatory approval is obtained. As the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition under U.S. GAAP, the Company will recognize all sales-based milestone and royalty payments in cost of sales as revenue from product sales is recognized. Following the approval of the NDA for AGAMREE on October 26, 2023, the Company became obligated to make a milestone payment of million to Santhera. The million payment was made during the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company capitalized the million payment which is amortized using the straight-line method over the product s estimated useful life of years. The strategic equity investment in Santhera is accounted for as an investment in equity securities, and is recognized as a non-current asset, as the Company does not intend on selling the shares within 12 months. Since Santhera shares have a readily determinable fair value, the investment will be measured quarterly at fair value with changes reported in earnings in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). e. AGREEMENTS FOR DRUG MANUFACTURING, DEVELOPMENT, PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL STUDIES. The Company has entered into agreements with contract manufacturers for the manufacture of commercial drug and drug and study placebo for the Company s trials and studies, with contract research organizations (CRO) to conduct and monitor the Company s trials and studies and with various entities for laboratories and other testing related to the Company s trials and studies. The contractual terms of the agreements vary, but most require certain advances as well as payments based on the achievement of milestones. Further, these agreements are cancellable at any time, but obligate the Company to reimburse the providers for any time or costs incurred through the date of termination.

OVERVIEW 
 We are a commercial-stage, patient-centric biopharmaceutical company focused on in-licensing, developing, and commercializing novel high-quality medicines for patients living with rare and difficult to treat diseases. We currently market three drug products, FIRDAPSE (amifampridine), FYCOMPA (perampanel), and AGAMREE (vamorolone). We are also currently seeking to further expand our drug portfolio, with a focus on acquiring the rights to late-stage products to treat rare (orphan) central nervous system and adjacent rare (orphan) diseases. With an unwavering patient focus embedded in everything we do, we are committed to providing innovative, best-in-class medications with the hope of making a meaningful impact on those affected by these conditions. 
 FIRDAPSE 
 	On November 28, 2018, we received approval from the FDA for our new drug application, or NDA, for FIRDAPSE Tablets 10 mg for the treatment of adult patients (ages 17 and above) with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), and in January 2019, we launched FIRDAPSE in the United States. Further, on September 29, 2022, the FDA approved our supplemental NDA (sNDA) to expand the indicated age range for FIRDAPSE Tablets 10 mg to include pediatric patients six years of age and older for the treatment of LEMS. Finally, on May 30, 2024, we reported that the FDA had approved our sNDA increasing the indicated maximum daily dosage of FIRDAPSE tablets for the treatment of patients with LEMS from 80 mg to 100 mg. We believe that this most recent sNDA approval offers healthcare providers and patients greater flexibility in treatment regimens for the management of LEMS. 
 We sell FIRDAPSE in the United States through a field force experienced in neurologic, central nervous system or rare disease products consisting at this time of approximately 40 field personnel, including sales (Regional Account Managers), thought leader liaisons and patient assistance and insurance navigation support (Patient Access Liaisons). We also have a field-based force of nine medical science liaisons who are helping educate the medical community about scientific literature concerning LEMS and FIRDAPSE . Additionally, we use non-personal promotion to reach the 20,000 neurologists who are potential LEMS treaters and the 16,000 oncologists who might be treating a LEMS patient who also has small cell lung cancer. Further, we continue to make available at no-cost a LEMS voltage gated calcium channel antibody diagnostic testing program for use by physicians who suspect that one of their patients may have LEMS and wish to reach a definitive diagnosis. 
 Finally, we are continuing to expand our digital and social media activities to introduce our products and services to potential patients and their healthcare providers. We also work with several rare disease advocacy organizations (including the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, the National Organization for Rare Disorders, and the LEMS Family Association) to help increase 
 33 

Table of Contents 

awareness and level of support for patients living with LEMS and to provide education for the physicians who treat these rare diseases and the patients they treat. 
 We are supporting the distribution of FIRDAPSE through Catalyst Pathways , our personalized treatment support program for patients who enroll in it. Catalyst Pathways is a single source for personalized treatment support, education and guidance through the challenging dosing and titration regimen required to reach an effective therapeutic dose. The program also includes distributing the drug through a very small group of exclusive specialty pharmacies (primarily AnovoRx), which is consistent with the way that most drug products for ultra-orphan diseases are distributed and dispensed to patients. We believe that by using specialty pharmacies in this way, the difficult task of navigating the health care system is far better for the patient needing treatment for their rare disease and the health care community in general. 
 In order to help patients with LEMS afford their medication, we, like other pharmaceutical companies which market drug products for ultra-orphan conditions, have developed an array of financial assistance programs to reduce out-of-pocket costs that makes FIRDAPSE accessible and affordable. A co-pay assistance program has been designed to reduce commercial patients out of pocket costs to 0 whenever possible. Our FIRDAPSE co-pay assistance program is not available to patients enrolled in state or federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, VA, DoD, or TRICARE. However, we are donating, and committing to continue to donate, money to qualified, independent charitable foundations dedicated to providing assistance to any U.S. LEMS patients in financial need, who meet those independent organizations guidelines. In addition, we have a safety net program in place for patients who are uninsured and underinsured. Subject to compliance with regulatory requirements, our goal is that no LEMS patient is ever denied access to their medication for financial reasons. 
 On December 18, 2023, DyDo Pharma, Inc. (DyDo), our sub-licensee for FIRDAPSE in Japan, filed a Japan NDA with the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan seeking approval to commercialize FIRDAPSE for the treatment of LEMS in Japan. Upon acceptance of the Japan NDA by the PMDA on December 18, 2023, our license for FIRDAPSE automatically expanded to include other key markets in Asia and Latin America, and we are currently seeking opportunities to expand FIRDAPSE s global footprint through strategic partnerships (with the current focus on the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions). Further, on September 24, 2024, DyDo advised us that the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) had approved DyDo's Japan NDA to commercialize FIRDAPSE for the treatment of patients with LEMS in Japan and that they expect to launch the product in Japan by the end of the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 We control six U.S. patents for FIRDAPSE that are listed in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book), the earliest of which expires in 2032 and the latest of which expires in 2037. We also have orphan drug exclusivity (ODE) for the product that will not expire until November 2025, and no Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for the product can be finally approved by the FDA until the ODE exclusivity period has expired. Nevertheless, generic drug manufacturers are permitted to file applications for the product challenging our patents, and in January 2023, we received Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letters from three generic drug manufacturers advising that they had each submitted an ANDA to the FDA seeking authorization from the FDA to manufacture, use or sell a generic version of FIRDAPSE in the U.S. The notice letters each alleged that the six patents protecting FIRDAPSE that are listed in the Orange Book in connection with FIRDAPSE are not valid, not enforceable, and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use or sale of the proposed product described in these ANDA submissions. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), as amended by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, we had 45 days from receipt of the notice letters to determine if there were grounds to bring a lawsuit and, if so, to commence patent infringement lawsuits against these generic drug manufacturers in a federal district court, which would trigger a statutory stay precluding the FDA from final approval of the subject ANDA until May 2026 or entry of judgment holding the patents invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, whichever occurs first in all cases (but not earlier than the expiration of orphan drug exclusivity on November 28, 2025). In that regard, after conducting the necessary due diligence, we filed lawsuits on March 1, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against each of the three generic drug manufacturers who notified us of their ANDA submissions, thus triggering the stay. All of these lawsuits are progressing. For updated information, see Note 12 (Commitments and Contingencies) in Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item I of this Form 10-Q. 
 Further, in October 2023, we received a Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letter from a fourth generic drug manufacturer, and we filed a similar lawsuit against that manufacturer in November 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. On July 30, 2024, we settled this patent litigation with the fourth of the ANDA filers to file an ANDA for FIRDAPSE . In that settlement, the ANDA filer acknowledged both the validity of our FIRDAPSE patents and also the infringement by the ANDA filer's product of our patents. As part of the settlement, the ANDA filer agreed not to commercialize its product until the earlier of all FIRDAPSE patents expiration or the entry into the market of another ANDA product meeting certain conditions. 
 The outcome of patent litigation with Paragraph IV challengers is always uncertain and there can be no assurance to whether we will prevail in this litigation. However, we are vigorously defending our intellectual property for FIRDAPSE in this litigation and while there can be no assurance, we believe that our patent estate will protect FIRDAPSE from generic competition for the life of our patents. For updated information, see Note 12 (Commitments and Contingencies) in Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item I of this Form 10-Q.

FYCOMPA 
 On December 17, 2022, we entered into an agreement with Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai) for the acquisition of the U.S. rights to FYCOMPA (perampanel) CIII. FYCOMPA is a selective non-competitive antagonist of AMPA receptors, the major subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors. It was the first, and still the only, drug of its class to be approved for epilepsy. Studies suggest that AMPA receptor antagonism can lead to reduced overstimulation and anticonvulsant effects, as well as inhibiting seizure generation and spread. FYCOMPA is a controlled substance and is approved with a box warning label. FYCOMPA is used to treat certain types of focal onset seizures (seizures that involve only one part of the brain) in adults and children four years of age and older. It is also used in combination with other medications to treat certain types of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (also known as a grand mal seizure, a seizure that involves the entire body) in adults and children 12 years of age or older. Perampanel is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain. 
 On January 24, 2023, we closed our acquisition of the U.S. rights to FYCOMPA . In connection with the acquisition, we purchased Eisai s regulatory approvals and documentation, product records, intellectual property, inventory, and other matters relating to the U.S. rights for FYCOMPA , in exchange for an upfront payment of 160 million in cash. We also agreed to pay Eisai royalty payments after patent protection for FYCOMPA expires, which royalty payments will be reduced upon generic equivalents to FYCOMPA entering the market. 
 In conjunction with the closing of the asset purchase, we entered into two additional agreements, a Transition Services Agreement (TSA) and a Supply Agreement. Under the Supply Agreement, Eisai agreed to manufacture FYCOMPA for us for at least seven years at prices listed in the Supply Agreement (to be updated on a yearly basis), and under the TSA, a U.S. subsidiary of Eisai provided us with certain transitional services (which transition services ended on December 31, 2023). 
 We sell FYCOMPA in the United States through a field force experienced in epilepsy products consisting at this time of approximately 29 field personnel, including sales (Regional Account Managers) and payor reimbursement (National Account Managers). We also have a field-based force of seven medical science liaisons who are helping educate the medical community who treat epilepsy about scientific literature regarding epilepsy and FYCOMPA . Further, effective January 1, 2024, FYCOMPA is being sold and distributed through a 3PL organization. 
 We are supporting patients using FYCOMPA through an Instant Savings Card Program. Through the program, eligible commercially insured patients could pay as little as 5 for their FYCOMPA co-pay (with a maximum savings of 2,500 per year). The FYCOMPA Instant Savings Card Program is not available to patients enrolled in state or federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Defense (DoD), or TRICARE. 
 Patent protection for FYCOMPA is primarily derived from two patents listed in the FDA s Orange Book. The first, U.S. patent no. 6,949,571 (the 571 patent), will expire on May 23, 2025, including patent term extension. The second FYCOMPA patent in the Orange Book is U.S. Patent No. 8,772,497 (the 497 patent), which expires on July 1, 2026. The 497 patent, which covers the API used in both FYCOMPA tablets and oral solution, has been the subject of previous Paragraph IV certifications from three ANDA filers for the tablet formulation, which were not contested by Eisai prior to our acquisition of the drug. Following our acquisition of the drug, we attempted to obtain an extension of the patent term for the '571 patent, which was ultimately unsuccessful. As a result, the '571 patent will expire on May 23, 2025 and the initial ANDA filers who did not challenge this patent may seek approval of their ANDA applications on or after that date. 
 In February 2023 we received a Paragraph IV certification for the '571 patent from an ANDA filer for two applications, one for the FYCOMPA tablets and another for the FYCOMPA oral suspension. After due diligence we filed lawsuits on April 5, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the drug manufacturer who notified us of their ANDA submissions alleging infringement of both patents. In June 2024, we settled the pending Paragraph IV litigation with the Paragraph IV filer for both ANDAs. As part of that settlement, this Paragraph IV filer agreed not to commercialize their proposed ANDA products for both the oral suspension formulation of FYCOMPA and for FYCOMPA tablets until at least December 15, 2025. 
 AGAMREE 
 On June 19, 2023, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (AGAMREE License Agreement) and an Investment Agreement (Investment Agreement) with Santhera Pharmaceuticals Holding, Inc. (Santhera). Under the AGAMREE License Agreement, we contracted to obtain an exclusive North America license, manufacturing and supply agreement for Santhera s investigational product candidate, AGAMREE (vamorolone), a novel corticosteroid for the treatment of DMD. Under the Investment Agreement, we agreed to make a strategic investment into Santhera. 
 Both transactions closed on July 18, 2023. Under the AGAMREE License Agreement, upon closing we made a 75 million payment to Santhera in return for the exclusive North American license for AGAMREE . In addition to the rights to commercialize the product in North America, the AGAMREE License Agreement provides us with the right of first negotiation for AGAMREE in Japan should Santhera pursue partnership opportunities in that territory. Additionally, we will hold the North 
 35 

Table of Contents 

American rights to any future approved indications for AGAMREE . Finally, under our AGAMREE License Agreement with Santhera, we have agreed to purchase commercial supply of AGAMREE from Santhera at agreed upon prices. 
 Concurrent with the closing of the AGAMREE License Agreement, we made a strategic investment into Santhera in which we acquired 1,414,688 of Santhera s ordinary shares (representing approximately 11.26 of Santhera s outstanding ordinary shares immediately following the transaction) at an investment price of CHF 9.477 per share, with the approximately 15.7 million USD in equity investment proceeds to be used by Santhera for Phase IV studies of AGAMREE in DMD and future development of additional indications for AGAMREE . On November 4, 2024, the closing price of Santhera s common shares on the SIX Swiss Exchange was CHF 8.66 per share (approximately 10.03 USD based on current exchange rates). 
 On October 26, 2023, the U.S. FDA approved Santhera s NDA for AGAMREE for use in treating DMD in patients aged two years and older. Shortly thereafter, as part of the previously described transaction, Santhera transferred the approved New Drug Application to us. Additionally, following approval of the NDA for the drug, we became obligated to make a milestone payment of 36 million to Santhera, which we paid during the 2023 fourth quarter. We may also be obligated to pay future regulatory and commercial milestone payments to Santhera tied to calendar year sales of AGAMREE , as well as commercial royalties. 
 On March 13, 2024, we announced the U.S. commercial launch of AGAMREE for the treatment of DMD in patients aged two years or older. During the first quarter of 2024 in connection with our preparation for the commercial launch of AGAMREE we incurred substantial commercialization expenses, including sales, marketing, analytical infrastructure, patient services, patient advocacy, and other commercialization related expenses. Due to the synergy of this product with our existing neuromuscular franchise, in connection with the launch of AGAMREE we have only needed to add approximately 10 additional members to our commercial team to market the product. We are further supporting the distribution of AGAMREE through our Catalyst Pathways patient services program to ensure that patients have access to a dedicated, personalized support team that assists families through the AGAMREE patient journey, from answering questions to coordinating financial assistance programs for eligible patients. Finally, we are intending to donate funds to one or more qualified, independent charitable financial foundations who assist U.S. DMD patients in accessing their medication, to the extent permitted by each such organization's guidelines. 
 Finally, we have established a joint steering committee with Santhera that is overseeing the lifecycle management and development of AGAMREE for additional indications beyond DMD. 
 DMD, the most common form of muscular dystrophy, is a rare and life-threatening neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle dysfunction, ultimately leading to loss of ambulation, respiratory failure, and fatality. Current standard treatment for DMD involves corticosteroids, which often come with significant side effects. It is estimated that between 11,000 and 13,000 patients in the U.S. are affected by DMD, with approximately 70 of patients currently receiving a corticosteroid treatment. Steroids are expected to remain the backbone of therapy for DMD patients and dosed concomitantly with other therapies. 
 AGAMREE s unique mode of action is based on differential effects on glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors and modifying further downstream activity. As such, it is considered a novel corticosteroid that we hope has the potential to demonstrate comparable efficacy to corticosteroids, with the potential for a better-tolerated side effect profile. This mechanism of action may allow vamorolone to emerge as an effective alternative to the current standard of care corticosteroids in children, adolescents, and adult patients with DMD. In that regard, we have launched a long-term registry study of AGAMREE , which we have designated as the SUMMIT study, which aims to gather long-term patient safety and quality of life data, offering a deeper understanding of the product's potential long-term benefits for patients. 
 On October 13, 2023, Santhera announced that the European Union s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive position in favor of AGAMREE for the treatment of DMD patients aged four and older. In its recommendation for approval, CHMP acknowledged that there was a positive benefit-risk profile of AGAMREE in such patient population, including certain safety benefits of AGAMREE compared to standard of care corticosteroids in the treatment of DMD. Further, on December 18, 2023, the European Commission (EC) granted to Santhera marketing authorization for AGAMREE for the treatment of DMD in patents ages four years and older and on January 12, 2024 Santhera announced that AGAMREE had received approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom. Finally, on January 15, 2024, Santhera announced that AGAMREE was commercially launched in Germany. 
 In the United States, AGAMREE has New Chemical Entity exclusivity that expires in October 2028. AGAMREE also enjoys Orphan Drug Exclusivity expiring in October 2030. AGAMREE is further protected by six Orange Book listed patents expiring as early as May 28, 2029 and as late as July 16, 2040. The Company has also requested Patent Term Extension and will update the relevant expiration date in the Orange Book upon a final determination by the USPTO. The earliest a generic manufacturer could file an ANDA is October 26, 2027. If we were to pursue a patent infringement action if any such ANDA challenges any of AGAMREE s Orange Book patents, then the automatic statutory 30-month stay would prevent FDA approval of such ANDA until April 26, 2031. 
 Finally, on July 23, 2024 we entered into a license, supply and commercialization agreement with KYE Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KYE) granting KYE the exclusive Canadian commercial rights to market AGAMREE in Canada for DMD and other indications. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

Under the agreement, KYE (which is also the Company's sublicensee for FIRDAPSE in Canada) will be responsible for obtaining regulatory approval of the product from Health Canada (of which there can be no assurance), and we will supply product to KYE. Further, during the third quarter of 2024, we received an upfront payment from KYE, and we will be eligible to receive further reimbursement and sales milestones and sales royalties for AGAMREE . Also, KYE has advised us that they expect to file an application with Health Canada seeking approval to commercialize AGAMREE in Canada in early 2025. There can be no assurance that any such application when and if filed will be approved, and even if such application is approved that KYE will be successful in commercializing AGAMREE in Canada. 
 Business Development 
 We continue to advance our strategic initiatives and portfolio expansion efforts, focusing on broadening and diversifying our rare (orphan) Neurology product portfolio with innovative therapies that address critical unmet medical needs and expanding the geographical footprint of our existing products. In that regard, we are currently exploring clinically differentiated and adequately de-risked opportunities, with a keen focus on products to treat rare (orphan) central nervous system (CNS) and adjacent rare (orphan) diseases. These prospects include evaluating companies with existing commercial drug products or drugs in development, for potential partnerships, licensing, geographical expansion opportunities with our existing products, and/or asset acquisitions. We continue to employ a disciplined, comprehensive, and exhaustive approach to identifying and evaluating opportunities that we believe will add significant value to our company over the near, mid, and long term. However, other than the recent sublicense described above between the Company and KYE for AGAMREE in Canada, no definitive agreements have been entered into to-date, and there can be no assurance that any of the Company's business development initiatives will be successful. 
 Capital Resources 
 At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 442.3 million. Based on our current financial condition and forecasts of available cash, we believe that we have sufficient funds to support our operations for at least the next 12 months. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in commercializing FIRDAPSE , FYCOMPA and AGAMREE , or that we will continue to be profitable and cash flow positive. Further, there can be no assurance that if we need additional funding in the future, whether such funding will be available to us on acceptable terms. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 Revenues. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues from U.S. product sales of FIRDAPSE , FYCOMPA , and AGAMREE . We expect these revenues to fluctuate in future periods based on our sales of our products. We received approval from Health Canada on July 31, 2020, for FIRDAPSE for the symptomatic treatment of LEMS and as of December 31, 2020, our sub-licensee KYE Pharmaceuticals launched FIRDAPSE in Canada. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues generated under our collaboration agreement with KYE Pharmaceuticals were immaterial. We expect our revenues from the KYE collaboration agreement to fluctuate in future periods based on our collaborator s ability to sell FIRDAPSE in Canada. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no revenues were generated under our collaborative agreement with Endo, Inc. (formerly, Endo International plc) (Endo). In July 2024, a termination and mutual release agreement was finalized between Endo and us that discontinued work on the collaboration for development and commercialization of vigabatrin. The end of the collaboration does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated approximately 2.1 million in revenues from our collaborative agreement with DyDo, which consisted of a milestone payment earned upon DyDo receiving regulatory approval to commercialize FIRDAPSE for the treatment of patients with LEMS in Japan. We expect our revenue from the DyDo license agreement to fluctuate in future periods based on DyDo s ability to meet various regulatory and potential sales milestones set forth in such agreement. 
 Cost of Sales. 
 Cost of sales consists of third-party manufacturing costs, freight, royalties, and indirect overhead costs associated with sales of our products. Cost of sales may also include period costs related to certain inventory manufacturing services, inventory adjustments charges, unabsorbed manufacturing and overhead costs and manufacturing variances. 
 Research and Development Expenses. 
 Our research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for company-sponsored research and development activities, support for selected investigator-sponsored research, and support for our commercial activities. The major components of research and 
 37 

Table of Contents 

development costs include preclinical study costs, clinical manufacturing costs, clinical study and trial expenses, insurance coverage for clinical trials, consulting, and other third-party costs, salaries and employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, supplies and materials, and allocations of various overhead costs related to our product development efforts and support for our commercial efforts. Prior to January 2023, all of our research and development resources were devoted to the development of FIRDAPSE and two previously discontinued R D projects, CPP-109 (our version of vigabatrin), and CPP-115, and until we acquire or license new products, we currently expect that our future development costs will be attributable principally to the continued development and commercial support of FIRDAPSE and AGAMREE . 
 Our expense accruals for clinical studies and trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical study and trial sites and clinical research organizations (CROs). In the normal course of our business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical study and trial activities in the on-going development of potential products. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events or milestones, the successful enrollment of patients, the allocation of responsibilities among the parties to the agreement, and the completion of portions of the clinical study or trial or similar conditions. The objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our consolidated financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended. As such, expense accruals related to preclinical and clinical studies or trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific study or trial contract. We monitor service provider activities to the extent possible; however, if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies or trials at a given point in time, we could be required to record significant additional research and development expenses in future periods. Preclinical and clinical study and trial activities require significant up-front expenditures. We anticipate paying significant portions of a study or trial s cost before they begin and incurring additional expenditures as the study or trial progresses and reaches certain milestones. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. 
 Since 2019, we have incurred substantial commercialization expenses for FIRDAPSE , including sales, marketing, patient services, patient advocacy and other commercialization related expenses. We are also now incurring substantial commercialization expenses for FYCOMPA and AGAMREE . 
 Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel expenses for accounting, corporate, compliance, and administrative functions. Other costs include administrative facility costs, regulatory fees, insurance, and professional fees for legal (including litigation cost), information technology, accounting, and consulting services. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets. 
 Amortization of intangible assets consists of the amortization of the FYCOMPA product rights, which are amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life of 5 years, and the RUZURGI product rights, which are amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life of 14.5 years. We also capitalized the 36 million of milestone payment paid to Santhera during the fourth quarter of 2023 which is being amortized over the product s estimated useful life of 10.5 years. 
 Stock-Based Compensation. 
 We recognize expense for the fair value of all stock-based awards to employees, directors, and consultants in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For stock options, we use the Black-Scholes option valuation model in calculating the fair value of the awards. 
 Income Taxes. 
 Our effective income tax rate is the ratio of income tax expense (benefit) over our net income (loss) before income taxes. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards. 
 For discussion of recently issued accounting standards, please see Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. For a full discussion of our accounting policies, please refer to Note 2 on the Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K that we filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates include: accounting for revenue recognition, valuation of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and 
 38 

Table of Contents 

valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. We continually evaluate our judgments, estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on the terms of underlying agreements, our expected course of development, historical experience and other factors that we believe are reasonable based on the circumstances, the results of which form our management s basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Results of Operations 
 Revenues. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized total revenues of 128.7 million and 349.9 million, respectively, compared to 102.7 million and 287.6 million, respectively, in the same periods of 2023. FIRDAPSE net sales were approximately 79.3 million and 223.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 66.2 million and 188.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. FYCOMPA net sales were approximately 32.1 million and 99.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 36.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 98.8 million for the period between January 24, 2023 (date of acquisition) and September 30, 2023. AGAMREE net sales were approximately 15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 25.0 million for the period between March 13, 2024 (date of commercial launch) and September 30, 2024. 
 Net revenues from product sales of FIRDAPSE increased by 19.7 and 18.5 , respectively, from the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024. Product revenue for FYCOMPA during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were affected by differences in variable consideration (gross-to-net) compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the period between January 24, 2023 (date of acquisition) and September 30, 2023, when revenues were booked under Eisai s cost arrangements with distributors and government authorities. Starting on January 1, 2024, all such costs are tied to arrangements between us and those distributors and government agencies, which costs are higher than Eisai s costs, thereby increasing the gross-to-net deductions for FYCOMPA and correspondingly decreasing FYCOMPA net product revenue. In the first quarter of the calendar year, like many companies in our industry, we are also impacted by the reset of patient insurance deductibles. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also recognized 2.3 million and 2.4 million, respectively, in license and other revenue. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we also recognized 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively, in license and other revenue. 
 Cost of Sales. 
 Cost of sales was approximately 19.3 million and 47.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.2 million and 36.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of sales in both periods consisted principally of royalty payments, which are based on net revenue as defined in the applicable license agreements. For FIRDAPSE , royalties are payable on the terms set forth below in Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Arrangements , and increase by 3 when net sales (as defined in the applicable license agreement) exceed 100 million in any calendar year. Cost of sales for FYCOMPA in both periods consisted of product costs and excludes the amortization of the FYCOMPA intangible assets. Cost of sales for AGAMREE for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of royalties payable on the terms set forth below in Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Arrangements , product costs and excludes the amortization of the AGAMREE intangible asset. See Note 9 of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets. 
 Amortization of intangible assets was approximately 9.3 million and 28.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.5 million and 23.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Amortization of intangible assets consists of the amortization of the FYCOMPA rights, which are amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life of 5 years, and the RUZURGI rights, which are amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life of 14.5 years. We also capitalized a 36 million milestone payment paid to Santhera during the fourth quarter of 2023, which is being amortized over the product s estimated useful life of 10.5 years.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses decreased approximately 80.4 million and 82.3 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in both periods is primarily attributable to the 81.5 million IPR D purchase consideration for the acquisition of the license in North America for vamorolone during the third quarter of 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses primarily consisted of costs for development activities supporting our commercial products. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, research and development expenses consisted of costs relating to closing out sites for both our MuSK-MG clinical trial and our previously operated expanded access program, as well as costs for development activities supporting our commercial products. 
 We are continuing to focus our business development efforts on acquiring additional drug products that are (or may be, if approved) used to treat rare and difficult to treat diseases. If we make future acquisitions of products in earlier stages of development, or if we determine to evaluate products already approved for the treatment of additional indications or additional diseases, we expect that our research and development expenses during such future periods will become more significant. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 45.9 million and 33.6 million, respectively, and represented approximately 59 and 24 of total operating costs and expenses, respectively.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 12.3 million and 41.9 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. This was primarily attributable to an approximately 16.3 million increase in employee compensation and stock-based compensation related to annual merit increases and an increase in headcount resulting from the acquisitions of FYCOMPA and AGAMREE , an approximately 17.6 million increase in commercialization expenses related to the launch of AGAMREE and to the timing of our commitments to make contributions to 501(c)(3) organizations supporting LEMS patients of approximately 0.5 million. Further, an approximately 3.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense is related to the retirement of two former executive officers, which was recorded during the first quarter of 2024 upon lapse of the applicable revocation periods under the respective separation agreements with these former executives. 
 We expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to be substantial in future periods as we continue our efforts to increase our revenues from FIRDAPSE , continue our efforts to market FYCOMPA and AGAMREE , and take steps to further expand our business. 
 Stock -Based Compensation. 
 Total stock-based compensation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.4 million and 17.1 million, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 3.8 million and 10.0 million, respectively. In the first three quarters of 2024 and 2023, grants were principally for stock options relating to year-end bonus awards and grants to new employees. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net. 
 We reported other income (expense), net in all periods, primarily relating to interest on our investment of our cash and cash equivalents of 6.3 million and 9.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.8) million and 2.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Since Santhera s shares are traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange, they have a readily determinable fair value, and as a result the investment is measured quarterly, at fair value, with changes reported in other income (expense), net. 
 The components of other income (expense), net were as follows (in thousands):

Income Taxes. 
 Our effective income tax rate was 24.0 and 23.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Differences in our effective tax and the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 are increased by state income taxes, fluctuations in the value of investments and anticipated annual permanent differences offset by equity compensation deductions. Our effective tax rate is affected by many factors, including the number of stock options exercised in any period, and our effective tax rate is likely to fluctuate in future periods.

Table of Contents 

We had no uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Net Income (Loss). 
 Our net income (loss) was 43.9 million and 108.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 0.37 and 0.92, respectively, per basic share and 0.35 and 0.87, respectively, per diluted share) as compared to net income (loss) of 30.8) million and 36.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (( 0.29) and 0.34, respectively, per basic share and 0.29) and 0.32, respectively, per diluted share). 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through multiple offerings of our securities and revenues from product sales. At September 30, 2024 we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating 442.3 million and working capital of 433.6 million. At December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating 137.6 million and working capital of 143.3 million. At September 30, 2024, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents were deposited with two financial institutions, and such balances were in excess of federally insured limits. Further, as of such date, a significant amount of such funds were invested in money market accounts. 
 On September 8, 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to sell up to 500 million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants to purchase common stock, debt securities and units consisting of one or more of such securities (the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement). The 2023 Shelf Registration Statement (file no. 333-274427) became effective upon filing. On January 9, 2024, we completed a public offering of 10 million shares of our common stock under the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement, raising net proceeds of approximately 140.7 million. 
 Based on forecasts of available cash, we believe that we have sufficient resources to support our currently anticipated operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of this report. There can be no assurance that we will remain profitable or that we will be able to obtain any additional funding that we may require in the future. 
 In the future, we may require additional working capital to support our operations depending on our future success with FIRDAPSE , FYCOMPA and AGAMREE sales, or the products we acquire and continue to develop and whether our results continue to be profitable and cash flow positive. There can be no assurance as to the amount of any such funding that will be required for these purposes or whether any such funding will be available to us if and when it is required. 
 In that regard, our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the cost of diligence in seeking potential acquisitions and of the completion of such acquisitions, if any future acquisitions occur; 

future clinical trial results; 

the scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other product development activities; 

the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish; 

the cost and timing of regulatory approvals; 

the cost and delays in product development as a result of any changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our products; 

the amount of net revenues that we report from sales of FIRDAPSE , FYCOMPA and AGAMREE 

the effect of competition and market developments; 

the cost of filing and potentially prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and 

the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products. 

We may raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means. We also may seek governmental grants for a portion of the required funding for our clinical trials and preclinical trials. We may further seek to raise capital to fund additional product development efforts or product acquisitions, even if we have sufficient funds for our planned operations. Any sale by us of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that any such required additional funding will be available to us at all or available on terms acceptable to us. Further, to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaborative arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or grant sublicenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are not able to secure 
 42

additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs, which could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Cash Flows. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 168.9 million and 88.0 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Net cash used in investing activities was 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting primarily of purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was 255.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting primarily of payment in connection with the FYCOMPA asset acquisition and acquired IPR D and purchase of equity securities in connection with the vamorolone acquisition. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 136.2 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 10.2 million, consisting primarily of payment of liabilities arising from asset acquisition and payment of employee withholding tax related to stock-based compensation partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

Concurrently with the acquisition, the parties entered into two related agreements: (i) a short-term TSA for commercial and manufacturing services (to which transition services ended on December 31, 2023) and (ii) a long-term Supply Agreement for the manufacturing of FYCOMPA . Under the TSA, a U.S. subsidiary of Eisai provided certain commercial and manufacturing services to the Company for a transition period following the closing of the acquisition. Further, under the Supply Agreement, Eisai will manufacture FYCOMPA for the Company for a period of seven years (or such longer period as is set forth in the Supply Agreement) following the closing of the acquisition. 

We have entered into the following contractual arrangements with respect to AGAMREE (vamorolone): 
 Payments due under our license agreement for AGAMREE . In connection with our recent acquisition from Santhera:

 ITEM 3 . QUANTITATIVE AND Q UALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk-sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents that are from time to time invested in highly liquid money market funds and U.S. Treasuries. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. Our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PR OCEDURES 
 a. We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act, was recorded, processed, summarized or reported within the time periods specified in the rules and regulations of the SEC, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports was accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

b. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could have a material effect, or are reasonably likely to have a material effect, on our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INF ORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROC EEDINGS 
 Paragraph IV Patent Litigation 
 In January 2023, we received Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letters from three generic drug manufacturers advising that they had each submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to the FDA seeking authorization from the FDA to manufacture, use or sell a generic version of FIRDAPSE in the U.S. The notice letters each alleged that the six patents listed in the FDA Orange Book in connection with FIRDAPSE are not valid, not enforceable, and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use or sale of the proposed product described in these ANDA submissions. Under the FDCA, as amended by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, we had 45 days from receipt of the notice letters to determine if there were grounds to bring a lawsuit and, if so, to commence patent infringement lawsuits against these generic drug manufacturers in a federal district court, which would trigger a statutory stay precluding the FDA from final approval of the subject ANDAs until May 2026 or entry of judgment holding the patents invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, whichever occurs first. In that regard, after conducting the necessary due diligence, we filed lawsuits on March 1, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against each of the three generic drug manufacturers who notified us of their ANDA submissions, thus triggering the stay. All of these lawsuits are progressing. For updated information on the cases relating to FIRDAPSE patents, see Note 12 (Commitments and Contingencies) in Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item I of this Form 10-Q. 
 Further, in October 2023, we received a Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letter from a fourth generic drug manufacturer, and we filed a similar lawsuit against the manufacturer in November 2023. On July 30, 2024, we settled this patent litigation with the fourth of the ANDA filers for FIRDAPSE . In the settlement, the ANDA filer acknowledged both the validity of our FIRDAPSE patents and also the infringement by the ANDA filer's product of our patents. As part of the settlement, the ANDA filer agreed not to commercialize its product until the earlier of all FIRDAPSE patents expiration or the entry into the market of another ANDA product meeting certain conditions. For updated information on the cases relating to FIRDAPSE patents, see Note 12 (Commitments and Contingencies) in Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item I of this Form 10-Q. 
 The outcome of patent litigation with Paragraph IV challengers is always uncertain and there can be no assurance to whether we will prevail in this litigation. However, we are vigorously defending our intellectual property for FIRDAPSE in this litigation and we believe that our patent estate will protect FIRDAPSE from generic competition for the life of our patents. 
 On February 20, 2023, we received a Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letter from a company that appears to have filed the first ANDA for the oral suspension formulation for FYCOMPA . The same company sent a similar letter to us later in February with a similar certification for the tablet formulation for FYCOMPA , the fourth such certification for this formulation. Both of these letters were Paragraph IV certifications of non-infringement, non-validity, and unenforceability to the 497 patent for FYCOMPA but each application, like the previous Paragraph IV notices from ANDA filers, for FYCOMPA tablets does not challenge the 571 patent. Accordingly, the FDA may not approve any ANDA prior to expiration of the 571 patent on May 23, 2025. After due diligence we filed lawsuits on April 5, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the drug manufacturer who notified us of their ANDA submissions for both FYCOMPA formulations, thus triggering the 30 month stay for each application. In June 2024, we settled this lawsuit. As part of the settlement, this Paragraph IV filer agreed to not seek to commercialize its ANDA products for both the oral suspension formulation of FYCOMPA and FYCOMPA tablets until at least December 15, 2025. 
 Other Litigation 
 From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Other than as set forth above, we believe that there is no litigation pending at this time that could have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FA CTORS 
 There are many factors that affect our business, our financial condition, and the results of our operations. In addition to the information set forth in this quarterly report, you should carefully read and consider Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I, and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, which contain a description of significant factors that might cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired.

 In March 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to 40 million of our common stock, pursuant to a repurchase program under Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Act (the Share Repurchase Program ). The Share Repurchase Program commenced on March 22, 2021 and currently expires in March 2025. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 21 million remains available for share repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program. At present the Company has elected to retain cash for business development activities rather than making repurchases of its shares.
