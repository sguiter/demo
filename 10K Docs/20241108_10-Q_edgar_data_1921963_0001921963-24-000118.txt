 of Atmus net sales in 2023 were generated through first-fit sales to OEMs, where its products are installed as components for new vehicles and equipment. Approximately of Atmus net sales in 2023 were generated in the aftermarket, where its products are installed as replacement or repair parts, leading to a strong recurring revenue base. Building on its more than 65-year history, Atmus continues to grow and differentiate itself through its global footprint, comprehensive offering of premium products, technology leadership and multi-channel path to market. 
 In April 2022, Cummins Inc. Cummins announced its intention to separate its filtration business (the Filtration Business into a standalone publicly traded company (the Separation ). In preparation for the Separation from Cummins, Atmus, as its predecessor in interest, was incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cummins in Delaware on April 1, 2022 in connection with the planned Separation. Prior to the completion of Atmus initial public offering (the IPO ), Cummins completed, in all material respects, the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the Filtration Business to Atmus and its subsidiaries as detailed in the separation agreement Atmus entered into with Cummins. 
 On September 30, 2022, and as amended on February 15, 2023, Atmus entered into a billion credit agreement Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks, providing for a million term loan facility (the term loan and a million revolving credit facility (the revolving credit facility ), in anticipation of the Separation. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement did not become available until the IPO occurred. The facilities covered by the Credit Agreement will mature on September 30, 2027. 
 Atmus Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Commission on May 16, 2023, was declared effective on May 25, 2023, and Atmus common shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ATMU on May 26, 2023. On May 30, 2023, the IPO was completed through the sale on behalf of certain commercial paper holders of Cummins of shares of common stock, including the underwriters full exercise of their 30-day option to purchase an additional shares to cover over-allotments. None of the proceeds of the IPO were for the benefit of Atmus. As of the closing of the IPO, Cummins owned approximately of the outstanding shares of Atmus common stock. 
 Upon completion of the IPO, Atmus borrowed million, consisting of proceeds of the term loan and amounts drawn under the revolving credit facility, and paid such amounts to Cummins in partial consideration for the Separation. 
 On February 14, 2024, Cummins announced an exchange offer whereby Cummins shareholders could exchange all or a portion of Cummins common stock for shares of Atmus common stock owned by Cummins. The divestiture of Atmus shares by Cummins was completed on March 18, 2024 and resulted in the full separation of Atmus and divestiture of Cummins entire ownership and voting interest in Atmus Full Separation ).

 and , respectively . Atmus effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , was and , respectively . The decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a change in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions and discrete tax items. The Company s effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to differences in rates applicable to foreign subsidiaries, withholding taxes and state income taxes. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development introduced a framework to impose a global minimum tax rate of 15 for certain companies, referred to as Pillar 2, with certain aspects of Pillar 2 effective as of January 1, 2024. During 2023, numerous countries enacted legislation to incorporate Pillar 2 model rule concepts into their domestic laws and other countries are in the process of introducing legislation to implement Pillar 2. Based on our evaluation of the impact of this legislation, based on Atmus current global landscape, Pillar 2 has not yet had, nor do we expect it to have, a material impact on our effective tax rate or our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We will continue to update our analysis and monitor the ongoing legislation.

 General Overview 
 Company Overview 
 We are one of the global leaders of filtration products for on-highway commercial vehicles and off-highway agriculture, construction, mining and power generation vehicles and equipment. We design and manufacture advanced filtration products, principally under the Fleetguard brand, that provide superior asset protection and enable lower emissions. We estimate that approximately 19 of our net sales in 2023 were generated through first-fit sales to OEMs, where our products are installed as components for new vehicles and equipment. We estimate that approximately 81 of our net sales in 2023 were generated in the aftermarket, where our products are installed as replacement or repair parts, leading to a strong recurring revenue base. Building on our more than 65-year history, we continue to grow and differentiate ourselves through our global footprint, comprehensive offering of premium products, technology leadership and multi-channel path to market. 
 Separation from Cummins 
 In April 2022, Cummins Inc. Cummins announced its intention to separate its filtration business (the Filtration Business into a standalone publicly traded company (the Separation ). We were incorporated in Delaware on April 1, 2022, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cummins, in anticipation of the Separation, and prior to the completion of our initial public offering (the IPO ), Cummins completed, in all material respects, the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the Filtration Business to us and our subsidiaries. 
 Our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended, filed on May 16, 2023, was declared effective on May 25, 2023, and our common shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ATMU on May 26, 2023. On May 30, 2023, the IPO was completed through Cummins exchange of 16,243,070 shares of our common stock, including the underwriters full exercise of their option to purchase an additional 2,118,661 shares to cover over-allotments. None of the proceeds of the IPO were for the benefit of

 Atmus. As of the closing of the IPO, Cummins owned approximately 80.5 of the outstanding shares of our common stock. 
 On September 30, 2022, and as amended on February 15, 2023, Atmus entered into a 1.0 billion credit agreement Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks, providing for a 600 million term loan facility (the term loan and a 400 million revolving credit facility (the revolving credit facility ), in anticipation of the Separation. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement did not become available until the IPO occurred. Upon completion of the IPO, we borrowed 650 million, consisting of proceeds of the term loan and amounts drawn under the revolving credit facility, and paid such amounts to Cummins in partial consideration for the Separation. 
 In connection with the Separation, we entered into various agreements with Cummins, including a separation agreement. In the separation agreement, there were certain assets and liabilities identified in the schedules which were retained by Cummins, and those that were transferred to the Company. These agreements comprehensively provide a framework for our relationship with Cummins and govern various interim and ongoing relationships between us and Cummins post IPO. 
 On February 14, 2024, Cummins announced an exchange offer whereby Cummins shareholders could exchange all or a portion of Cummins common stock for shares of Atmus common stock owned by Cummins. The divestiture of Atmus shares by Cummins was completed on March 18, 2024 and resulted in the full separation of Atmus and divestiture of Cummins entire ownership and voting interest in Atmus Full Separation ). 
 Basis of Presentation 
 For the periods prior to the IPO, the discussion below relates to the financial position and results of operations of a combination of entities under common control that have been carved out of Cummins historical combined financial statements and accounting records. The historical combined financial statements reflect our historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). Refer to Note 2, Basis of Presentation , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. 
 For the period subsequent to our IPO on May 26, 2023, as a standalone public company, we present our financial statements on a consolidated basis. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. Our revenues may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels, production schedules, commodity prices, work stoppages and supply chain challenges. Economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products and/or markets. As a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by currency exchange rate changes, political and economic uncertainty, public health crises (epidemics or pandemics) and regulatory matters, including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards in the countries we serve. Some of the more important factors affecting our performance are briefly discussed below. 
 Market demand 
 Aftermarket demand remained depressed in the first nine months of 2024 reflecting soft market conditions. It is uncertain when a recovery can be expected. First-fit demand softened across many of our key markets during the third quarter of 2024 which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Global supply chain 
 While overall supply chain conditions continue to affect inventory and backlog levels, they have largely stabilized from a year ago with minimal disruptions now being experienced and backorders largely recovered. Our management team continues to monitor and evaluate all of these factors and the related impacts on our 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 business and operations, and we are diligently working to continue to minimize any supply chain impacts to our business and to our customers. 
 Commodity prices, labor, inflation and foreign currency exchange rates 
 We have seen inflationary impacts largely subside in the third quarter. Direct material cost pressures, driven largely by steel, resin and other petrochemical products, have stabilized, but we continue to see impacts from labor. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, our Selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of increased people-related and consulting expenses. 
 Additionally, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies had a slightly unfavorable impact on our condensed consolidated results of operations in the first nine months of 2024 due to translation impacts; there can be no assurances that this trend will continue the remainder of 2024 . 
 Standalone costs 
 We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs associated with becoming a standalone public company. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , we incurred approximately 8.9 million of one-time expenses including 5.0 million within Cost of sales and 3.9 million within Selling, general and administrative expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we incurred approximately 18.7 million of one-time expenses including 8.0 million within Cost of sales and 10.7 million within Selling, general and administrative expenses. We expect to incur one-time expenses of approximately 20 million to 25 million in 2024 in connection with becoming a standalone public company. In addition, we expect to incur capital expenditures in connection with the Separation of approximately 13 million to 18 million in 2024. These expenses and capital expenditures primarily relate to the establishment of functions previously co-mingled with Cummins, such as information technologies, distribution centers, manufacturing and human resources. These expenses and capital expenditures are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2024 but some expenses and capital expenditures will be incurred in 2025. The actual amount of the expenses and capital expenditures we will incur as a stand-alone public company may be higher, perhaps significantly, from our current estimates for a number of reasons, including, among others, the final terms we are able to negotiate with service providers, as well as additional costs we may incur that we have not currently anticipated. Additionally, the actual timing of when we incur these incremental expenses may be different, perhaps significantly, from our current estimates for a number of reasons, including, among others, unforeseen events that may cause delays or interruptions in our plans or our service providers ability to provide their services.

The decrease in Research, development and engineering expenses as a percentage of Net sales was mainly due to the item noted above. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 In connection with the Separation, we entered into a tax matters agreement with Cummins that, among other things, formalized our agreement related to the responsibility for historical tax positions for the period prior to the IPO for jurisdictions where our business was included in the consolidated or combined tax returns of Cummins. 
 Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 18.4 , a decrease of 4.7 percentage points compared to 23.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a change in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions and discrete tax items. Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to differences in rates applicable to foreign subsidiaries, withholding taxes and state income taxes.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our facilities under the Credit Agreement provide for 1.0 billion in total availability, which includes a 600 million term loan and a 400 million revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, we have outstanding borrowings of 596 million on the term loan and zero on the revolving credit facility. As a result, we had capacity under our revolving credit facility of 400 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 We believe that cash from operations and the facilities under our Credit Agreement will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and future payments of our contractual, tax and benefit plan obligations and payments for share repurchases and quarterly dividends in both the short and long term. Overall, we do not expect negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity. However, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues or other adverse developments arise, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for raw materials, labor, manufacturing and distribution, trade and promotions, advertising and marketing, tax liabilities, benefit plan obligations and lease expenses) as well as periodic expenditures for anticipated capital investments, shareholder returns (such as dividend payments and share repurchases), interest payments on our long-term debt and supporting any future acquisitions. 
 Long-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding long-term debt repayments and our long-term benefit plan obligations. 
 Cash Flow 
 Our management reviews our liquidity needs in determining any and all indebtedness options. We have the ability to access the capital markets and other sources of liquidity, which management believes are sufficient to allow us to manage our business and give us flexibility to meet our short- and long-term financial commitments. Our cash flow activity is noted below: 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 
 85.4 147.3 Net cash used in investing activities (38.6) (29.6) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities 
 (18.0) 21.1 
 Operating Cash Flow 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 85.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , a decrease of 61.9 million compared to Net cash provided by operating activities of 147.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease was driven primarily by higher working capital requirements of 83.9 million, partially offset by higher net income and higher other liabilities primarily related to leases of 7.4 million . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , higher working capital requirements resulted in a cash outflow of 81.9 million compared to a cash inflow of 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , mainly due to lower other accrued expenses, driven by one-time working capital inefficiencies associated with the move from intercompany settlement terms with Cummins to standalone practices of 26.9 million and variable compensation, higher inventories, lower trade payables and higher trade receivables. 
 Dividends received from our unconsolidated equity investees were 22.6 million and 17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , respectively. Dividends are typically paid in the second through the fourth quarters and are included in Net cash provided by operating activities.

 Investing Cash Flow 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was primarily used for capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures were 38.6 million (of which approximately 12.4 million related to One-time separation costs) and 29.6 million (of which approximately 4.8 million related to One-time separation costs) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , respectively, corresponding to approximately 3.1 of Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 2.4 of Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 Financing Cash Flow 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 18.0 million and Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 21.1 million . Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of repurchases of common stock, dividends paid and payments made on our term loan. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of long-term debt proceeds from our borrowings of 650 million under our Credit Agreement, partially offset by net transfers of 580.3 million to Cummins as part of the Separation and 50 million repayment on our revolving credit facility. 
 Dividends 
 We paid dividends of 4.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 and none in the first nine months of 2023. The third quarter 2024 dividend of 0.05 per share, declared on July 17, 2024 for shareholders of record as of August 1, 2024, was paid on August 14, 2024. On October 17, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.05 per share of Common stock. This dividend is payable on November 13, 2024 to shareholders of record as of October 31, 2024. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making. 
 We anticipate that the 2024 distributions will be characterized as dividends under the U.S. federal income tax rules. The final determination will be made on an IRS Form 1099-DIV we expect to issue early 2025. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Our commitments consist of lease obligations for real estate and equipment. For more information regarding our lease obligations, see Note 9, Leases , to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which provides a summary of our future minimum lease payments. 
 Debt 
 Our total debt was 596 million at September 30, 2024 and 600 million at December 31, 2023 . At September 30, 2024 , the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 2.9 years. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our debt and debt covenants. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying U.S. GAAP results throughout our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-Q. 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis. 
 EBITDA is defined as earnings or losses before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA as a percent of Net sales. We believe EBITDA and EBITDA margin are useful measures of our operating performance as they assist investors and debt holders in comparing our performance on a consistent basis without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or depreciation and amortization methods, which can vary significantly depending upon many factors. Additionally, we believe these metrics are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies and others in our industry in evaluating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA after adding back certain one-time expenses, reflected in Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses, associated with becoming a standalone public company and Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of Net sales. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful measures of our operating performance as they allow investors and debt holders to compare our performance on a consistent basis without regard to one-time costs attributable to our becoming a standalone public company. 
 Adjusted earnings per share is defined as diluted earnings per share (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) after adding back certain one-time expenses, reflected in Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses, associated with becoming a standalone public company less the related tax impact of the same one-time expenses. We believe Adjusted earnings per share provides improved comparability of underlying operating results. 
 Free cash flow is defined as cash flows provided by (used for) operating activities less capital expenditures and Adjusted free cash flow is defined as Free cash flow after adding back certain one-time capital expenditures and other separation related costs associated with becoming a standalone public company. We believe Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow are useful metrics used by management and investors to analyze our ability to service and repay debt and return value to shareholders. 
 The metrics defined above are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, U.S. GAAP financial measures and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. The metrics should be considered supplemental data; however, the amounts included in the EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted earnings per share, Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow calculations are derived from amounts included in the consolidated statements of net income and cash flows. We do not consider our non-GAAP financial measures as superior to, or a substitute for, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations are: 
 such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 such measures do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 
 other companies in our industry may calculate such measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and not rely on a single financial measure to evaluate our business.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting policies and estimates which affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements are identified and described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 As a result of our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks. We transact business in foreign currencies and, as a result, our income and financial condition are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. Financial derivatives are used by Atmus expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. Substantially all of Atmus derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements, which provide the option to settle certain contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day with the same currency. In addition, these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event. 
 To minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, Atmus enters into foreign currency forward contracts, which are considered economic hedges and are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. The objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract. 
 The potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts, would not have a material impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 . The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months. The analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. Any change in 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 the value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our interest rate risk relates primarily to our 600 million term loan facility and our five-year 400 million revolving credit facility. Borrowings under these facilities would bear interest at varying rates, depending on the type of loan and, in some cases, the rates of designated benchmarks and the applicable election made by us. Generally, U.S. dollar-denominated loans would bear interest at an adjusted term SOFR (which includes a 0.10 percent credit spread adjustment to SOFR) for the applicable interest period plus a rate ranging from 1.125 percent to 1.75 percent depending on our net leverage ratio. Based on our outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024 , a 0.125 change in SOFR would have a 0.7 million annual impact on interest expense. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for further information. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure . 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2024 . 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The Company is in the process of implementing a broad, multi-year, technology transformation project to modernize enterprise resource planning, middleware and legacy systems to achieve better process efficiencies across customer service, merchandising, sourcing, payroll and accounting through the use of various solutions. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company implemented a new enterprise resource planning system for core business processes supporting financial information and reporting. There have been no material additional implementations during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. As the Company s technology transformation project continues, the Company continues to emphasize the maintenance of effective internal controls and assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of key control activities throughout development and deployment of each phase and will evaluate as additional phases are deployed. 
 There was no other change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Atmus internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There were no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as set forth below: 
 We, or Cummins, may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the IPO or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire. 
 The separation agreement and other agreements entered into in connection with the IPO determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between Cummins and us following the IPO for those respective areas and include certain indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by Cummins and us for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the IPO. We will rely on Cummins to satisfy Cummins performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Cummins is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses. If we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once certain transaction agreements expire, we may not be able to operate our businesses effectively and our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. We are in the process of creating our own, or engaging third parties to provide, systems and services to replace many of the systems and services that Cummins currently provides to us. However, we may not be successful in implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from Cummins systems to us. In addition, we have historically received certain informal support from Cummins, including customer relationship management, marketing, communications, technical support, market intelligence and market data, which may not be addressed in our transition services agreement. The level of this informal support may be eliminated following the Separation. 
 Further, as part of the Separation, we implemented interim operational arrangements in certain markets due to regulatory requirements, the need to obtain consents from local governmental authorities, and other business reasons. For example, in Mexico, we previously operated as part of Cummins maquiladora, as we worked to stand-up our own maquiladora, which was completed during the third quarter of 2024. A maquiladora requires numerous governmental approvals and consents. If we fail to obtain any of these approvals or consents, or if such approvals or consents are delayed beyond the date agreed to with Cummins as part of the Separation, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected. 
 We also have established or expanded our own tax, treasury, internal audit, investor relations, corporate governance and listed company compliance and other corporate functions. We have been incurring and expect to continue incurring one-time costs to replicate, or outsource from other providers, these corporate functions to replace the corporate services that Cummins historically provided us prior to the IPO. Any failure or significant downtime in our own financial, administrative or other support systems or in the Cummins financial, administrative or other support systems during the transitional period during which Cummins provides us with support could negatively impact our results of operations or prevent us from paying our suppliers and employees, executing business combinations and foreign currency transactions or performing administrative or other services on a timely basis, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 In particular, our day-to-day business operations rely on our information technology systems. A significant portion of the communications among our personnel, customers and suppliers take place on our information technology platforms. We expect the separation of information technology systems from Cummins to be complex, time-consuming and costly. There is risk of data loss in the process of transferring information technology. As a result of our reliance on information technology systems, the cost of such information technology integration and transfer and any such loss of key data could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 In addition, our historical consolidated financial statements include the attribution of certain assets and liabilities that historically have been held at the Cummins corporate level but which are specifically identifiable or attributable to the businesses transferred to us in connection with the Separation. The value of the assets and liabilities we assumed in connection with the Separation could ultimately be materially different than such attributions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Our stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. 
 Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares. Further, our stock repurchase program may be suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and the existence of our stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program. See Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds - Repurchase of Equity in this Form 10-Q. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. 
 We cannot guarantee the payment of dividends on our common stock, or the timing or amount of any such dividends. 
 We have no obligation to continue paying a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock, and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders. The payment of any dividends in the future to our stockholders, and the timing and amount thereof, will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, general economic business conditions, industry practice, legal requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and on our access to the capital markets. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Dividends in this Form 10-Q. We cannot assure you that we will pay our anticipated dividend in the same amount or frequency, or at all, in the future.

 On July 17, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a 150 million share repurchase program. The program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Since the inception of the program, we repurchased approximately 10.0 million of Common stock pursuant to this authorization and as of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 140.0 million of share repurchase authorization remaining.
