 billion in cash, subject to certain additional customary adjustments. We believe the acquisition of Coyote enhances our competitive position with greater scale, a broader array of service offerings and strengths in a more diverse set of end markets. 
 The Transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the financial results of Coyote from the acquisition date. 
 The Company incurred acquisition-related costs of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which are included in Transaction and integration costs in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 The purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, and, as such, the excess was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any indicators of impairment. Goodwill is attributable to synergies expected to be achieved from the combined operations of the Company and Coyote and the assembled workforce. Goodwill recognized in the Transaction is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

 Revolving Credit Facilities 
 On October 18, 2022, we entered into a , million unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility (the Revolver ), with million available for the issuance of letters of credit. Loans under the Revolver bear interest at a fluctuating rate plus an applicable margin based on the Company s credit ratings, with interest payable quarterly. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitment, based on pricing levels set forth in the agreement. 
 On November 2, 2023, the Company exercised a feature to increase the total commitments under the Revolver from million to million. 
 The covenants in the Revolver are customary for financings of this type. The Revolver requires the Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than :1.00. On August 8, 2024, the Company and lenders entered into an amendment, which, following the completion of the Coyote acquisition on September 16, 2024, increased the Company s maximum consolidated leverage ratio to not greater than :1.00. At September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants of the Revolver. There were letters of credit outstanding on the Revolver at September 30, 2024. 
 In addition, the amendment extended, upon the completion date of the Coyote acquisition, the Revolver maturity date from the amendment date to September 16, 2029. To the extent there is more than million of the Company s Notes (as defined below) outstanding on the date that is days prior to the earlier of the extended maturity date and the maturity date of the Notes, then the extended maturity date will be subject to a springing earlier maturity date that is days prior to the earlier of the extended maturity date and the Notes maturity date, unless the Notes are refinanced or replaced with debt that matures at least 91 days after the extended maturity date. 
 We also have a non-U.S. revolving credit facility with a maximum commitment of approximately million. This facility has a term and we had million outstanding as of September 30, 2024 classified as short-term debt.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other written reports and oral statements we make from time to time contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as anticipate, estimate, believe, continue, could, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, should, will, expect, objective, projection, forecast, goal, guidance, outlook, effort, target, trajectory or the negative of these terms or other comparable terms. However, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to a material difference include those discussed below and the risks discussed in the Company s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). All forward-looking statements set forth in this Quarterly Report are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequence to or effects on the Company or its business or operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, and with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements set forth in this Quarterly Report speak only as of the date hereof, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, changes in expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by law. 
 
 Business Overview 
 RXO, Inc. RXO , the Company or we is a brokered transportation platform defined by cutting-edge technology and an asset-light business model. The largest component is our core truck brokerage business. Our operations also include asset-light managed transportation and last mile services, which complement our truck brokerage business. 
 Our truck brokerage business has a history of generating robust free cash flow conversion and a high return on invested capital. Shippers create demand for our service, and we place their freight with qualified independent carriers using our technology. We price our service on either a contract or a spot basis. 
 Notable factors driving volume growth in our business include our ability to access massive truckload capacity for shippers through our carrier relationships; our proprietary, cutting-edge technology; our strong management expertise; and favorable long-term industry tailwinds. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 150 thousand carriers in our North American truck brokerage network, and access to approximately 1.8 million trucks. 
 We provide our customers with highly efficient access to capacity through our digital brokerage technology. This proprietary platform is a major differentiator for our truck brokerage business, and together with our pricing technology, we believe it can unlock incremental profitable growth well beyond our current levels. Our complementary services for managed transportation and last mile also utilize our digital brokerage technology.

Table of Contents

The service uses proprietary technology to enhance our revenue synergy, with cross-selling to truck brokerage and last mile. Our managed transportation offering includes bespoke load planning and procurement, complex solutions tailored to specific challenges, performance monitoring, engineering and data analytics, among other services.

 Acquisition 
 On September 16, 2024 (the acquisition date ), the Company acquired the technology-driven, asset-light based truckload freight brokerage services business, as well as certain assets used to conduct haulage, dedicated transport and warehousing services in the United Kingdom (collectively, Coyote from United Parcel Service of America, Inc. UPS and certain subsidiaries of UPS. We acquired Coyote for 1.038 billion in cash, subject to certain additional customary adjustments. Refer to Note 3 Acquisition to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for disclosures regarding the Company s acquisition of Coyote. 
 
 Impact of Inflation 
 Economic inflation can have a negative impact on our operating costs, and any economic recession could depress activity levels and adversely affect our results of operations. A prolonged period of inflation could cause interest rates, fuel, wages and other costs to continue to increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations unless our pricing to our customers correspondingly increases. Generally, inflationary increases in labor and operating costs related to our operations have historically been offset through price increases. However, the pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during economic downturns, which may, as it has in the past, affect our ability to obtain price increases from customers both during and following such periods.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue increased by 6.6 to 1,040 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 976 million for the same quarter in 2023. The year-over-year increase in revenue in the third quarter of 2024 was driven primarily by a 105 million increase in revenue as a result of the Coyote acquisition in our truck brokerage business. This was partially offset by a 41 million decrease in legacy RXO truck brokerage revenue, driven primarily by a 5 decrease in load volume, as well as a 3 decrease in revenue per load, which was impacted by a combination of fuel prices, freight mix and transportation market rates. 
 Cost of transportation and services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the third quarter of 2024 was 809 million, or 77.8 of revenue, compared with 742 million, or 76.0 of revenue in the same quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase as a percentage of revenue during the third quarter of 2024 was driven primarily by a 1.3 percentage point increase in truck brokerage cost of transportation and services as a percentage of revenue, as lower freight rates were not fully offset by corresponding reductions in cost of purchased transportation during the quarter. 
 Direct operating expense (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) of 49 million in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 10 million, or 16.9 , from 59 million in the same quarter of 2023. As a percentage of revenue, direct operating expense (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased to 4.7 in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 6.0 in the same quarter of 2023 due to cost reduction initiatives.

 SG A of 149 million in the third quarter of 2024 increased 1 million, or 0.7 , from 148 million in the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of revenue, SG A decreased to 14.3 in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 15.2 for the same quarter of 2023 due to a 0.6 percentage point decrease in compensation-related expenses as a result of cost savings from restructuring actions executed in 2023 and the first nine months of 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 21 million, compared with 16 million for the same quarter in 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter of 2024 included 3 million as a result of the Coyote acquisition. 
 Transaction and integration costs for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were 30 million and 2 million, respectively. Transaction and integration costs for the third quarter of 2024 included 29 million as a result of the Coyote acquisition. 
 Restructuring costs for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were 2 million and 3 million, respectively, and primarily comprised severance costs. 
 Other expense for the third quarter of 2024 includes a one-time charge of 216 million representing a deemed non-pro rata distribution in connection with the private placement common stock issuance completed in August 2024. 
 Our effective income tax rates were (0.4) and 50.5 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was calculated using the discrete method. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 differs from the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21 primarily due to the effect of large non-deductible tax items associated with the Coyote acquisition and related common stock issuances. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was based on forecasted full-year effective tax rates, adjusted for discrete items that occurred within the period presented. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 differs from the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21 primarily due to state income taxes within the U.S and a discrete tax benefit associated with return to provision true-up.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our ability to fund our operations and anticipated capital needs is reliant upon the generation of cash from operations, supplemented as necessary by utilization of our revolving credit facility (the Revolver ). Our principal uses of cash in the future will be primarily to fund our operations, working capital needs, capital expenditures, repayment of borrowings, strategic business development transactions and share repurchases. The timing and magnitude of our growth and working capital needs can vary and may positively or negatively impact our cash flows. 
 We continually evaluate our liquidity requirements and capital structure in light of our operating needs, growth initiatives and capital resources. We believe that our existing liquidity and sources of capital are sufficient to support our operations over the next 12 months. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Our 2024 capital expenditures include capital allocations associated with strategic investments in technology, equipment and real estate. We believe that we have significant discretion over the amount and timing of our capital expenditures as we are not subject to any agreement that would require significant capital expenditures on a designated schedule or upon the occurrence of designated events. 
 Debt and Financing Arrangements 
 We were in compliance with all covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt and financing arrangements as of September 30, 2024. Any failure to comply with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations. Refer to Note 8 Debt to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for disclosures regarding the Company s debt and financing arrangements as of September 30, 2024. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Revolver was amended to increase the Company s maximum consolidated leverage ratio to not greater than 4.50:1.00. This amendment also extended the Revolver maturity date to September 16, 2029, subject to a springing earlier maturity date based on outstanding borrowings under the Company s existing notes. Refer to Note 8 Debt for additional information regarding this amendment. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed both a private placement and public offering of its common stock. Total proceeds from these offerings, net of related issuance costs, of approximately 1.1 billion were used to fund the acquisition of Coyote on September 16, 2024. Refer to Note 10 Stockholders Equity for additional information related to the equity issuances.
