 of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Electrochem Solutions, Inc. Electrochem to Ultralife for million in cash, subject to customary working capital adjustments. The consummation of the sale is expected to occur by the end of October 20 24. The divestiture of Electrochem also represents a sale of the Company s previously reported Non-Medical segment as the Electrochem business constituted substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations reported in the Non-Medical segment. Under the new organizational and reporting structure all continuing operations are included in reportable segment. 
 As a result of the anticipated sale, Electrochem met the criteria to be reported as held for sale and discontinued operations as of September 27, 2024. Because Electrochem was previously a reportable operating segment, the Company concluded the divestiture was a strategic shift in its business and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations as held for sale in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include cash flows related to the discontinued operations due to Integer s (parent) centralized treasury and cash management processes. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the Company s audited financial statements and has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect assets and liabilities held for sale . All results and information in the condensed consolidated financial statements is presented as continuing operations and excludes the Electrochem business unless otherwise noted specifically as discontinued operations. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations for additional information. 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States ("U.S.") Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and do not include all of the disclosures normally required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP as contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Accordingly, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 .

 of the outstanding capital stock of Pulse Technologies, Inc. Pulse ), a privately-held technology, engineering and contract manufacturing company focused on complex micro machining of medical device components for high growth structural heart, heart pump, electrophysiology, leadless pacing, and neuromodulation markets. Based in Pennsylvania, Pulse also provides proprietary advanced technologies, including hierarchical surface restructuring (HSR TM ), scratch-free surface finishes, and titanium nitride coatings. Consistent with the Company s tuck-in acquisition strategy, the acquisition of Pulse further increases the Company s end-to-end development capabilities and manufacturing footprint in targeted growth markets and provides customers with expanded capabilities, capacity and resources to accelerate the time to market for customer products. The Company funded the purchase price with borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) during the first quarter of 2024. 
 The Company has preliminarily estimated fair values for the assets purchased and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition. The determination of estimated fair value required management to make significant estimates and assumptions based on information that was available at the time that the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared. The amounts reported are considered preliminary as the Company is completing the valuations that are required to allocate the purchase price in areas such as property and equipment, intangible assets, liabilities and goodwill. As a result, the preliminary allocation of the purchase price may change in the future, including in ways which could be material. 
 The total consideration transferred was million, including contingent consideration, working capital and other purchase price adjustments. The Company recorded contingent consideration with an estimated acquisition date fair value of million, representing the Company s obligation, under the purchase agreement, to make an additional payment of up to million based on a specified revenue growth milestone being met in 2025. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments, inclusive of working capital and other closing adjustments, resulting in decreases to goodwill and current liabilities. The measurement period adjustments recorded during the first nine months of 2024 were not material.

Inventory Property, plant and equipment Goodwill Definite-lived intangible assets Finance lease assets Current liabilities ) Finance lease liabilities ) Fair value of net assets acquired 
 The preliminary fair values of the assets acquired were determined using one of three valuation approaches: market, income or cost. The selection of a particular method for a given asset depended on the reliability of available data and the nature of the asset, among other considerations. 
 Current Assets and Liabilities 
 The fair value of current assets and liabilities, excluding inventory, was assumed to approximate their carrying value as of the acquisition date due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. 
 The fair value of in-process and finished goods inventory acquired was estimated by applying a version of the income approach called the comparable sales method. This approach estimates the fair value of the assets by calculating the potential revenue generated from selling the inventory and subtracting from it the costs related to the completion and sale of that inventory and a reasonable profit allowance for these remaining efforts. Net book value was deemed to be a reasonable proxy for the fair value of raw materials. Based upon this methodology, the Company recorded the inventory acquired at fair value resulting in an increase in inventory of million. 
 Property, Plant and Equipment 
 The fair value of Property, Plant and Equipment acquired was estimated by applying the cost approach for personal property and leasehold improvements. The cost approach was applied by developing a replacement cost and adjusting for economic depreciation and obsolescence. 
 Leases 
 The Company recognized a finance lease liability and finance lease right-of-use asset for a manufacturing facility in accordance with ASC 842, Lease s. The lease terms were determined to be at-market as of the acquisition date. 
 Goodwill 
 The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. The goodwill resulting from the transaction is primarily attributable to future customer relationships and the assembled workforce of the acquired business. The goodwill acquired in connection with the Pulse acquisition was allocated to the Medical segment and is deductible for tax purposes.

Technology 
 Customer Lists - Customer lists represent the estimated fair value of contractual and non-contractual customer relationships Pulse had as of the acquisition date. These relationships were valued separately from goodwill at the amount that an independent third party would be willing to pay for these relationships. The fair value of customer lists was determined using the multi-period excess-earnings method, a form of the income approach. The estimated useful life of the existing customer base was based upon the historical customer annual attrition rate of , as well as management s understanding of the industry and product life cycles. 
 Technology - Technology consists of technical processes, patented and unpatented technology, manufacturing know-how, trade secrets and the understanding with respect to products or processes that have been developed by Pulse and that will be leveraged in current and future products. The fair value of technology acquired was determined utilizing the relief from royalty method, a form of the income approach, with a royalty rate of . The estimated useful life of the technology is based upon management s estimate of the product life cycle associated with the technology before it will be replaced by new technologies. 
 Contingent Consideration - As part of the Pulse acquisition, the Company may be required to pay additional consideration based on a specified revenue growth milestone being met in 2025. Any amounts earned will be payable in 2026. The contingent consideration is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and the fair value is measured based on a Monte Carlo simulation utilizing projections about future performance. Significant inputs include revenue volatility of , a discount rate of and projected financial information. See Note 14, Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements, for additional information related to the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration. 
 2023 Acquisition 
 Effective as of October 1, 2023, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of InNeuroCo, Inc. InNeuroCo ), a privately-held company based in Florida. InNeuroCo is a recognized leader in neurovascular catheter innovation with strong development and manufacturing capabilities. InNeuroCo s expertise and highly differentiated neurovascular catheter innovation complements the Company s existing capabilities and market focus. Consistent with the Company s strategy, the addition of InNeuroCo further increases Integer s ability to provide enhanced solutions to its customers in the neurovascular catheter space. The Company funded the purchase price with borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The total consideration transferred was million, which consists of an initial cash payment of million and million in estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The contingent consideration represents the estimated fair value of the Company s obligation, under the purchase agreement, to make additional payments of up to million based on specified annual revenue growth milestones being met through 2027, and a one-time contingent payment to be made based on cumulative revenue amounts through 2027 exceeding a specified revenue target. 
 The cost of the acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. From the date of acquisition through the quarter ended September 27, 2024, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments to update the allocation of the purchase price to certain current assets and, based on analysis of information as of the acquisition date, reduced goodwill by million. During the nine months ended September 27, 2024, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment of million, resulting in an increase to current assets and a decrease to goodwill.

The 2028 Convertible Notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 11.4681 shares of the Company s common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock.

 during the business day period after any consecutive trading day period (the Measurement Period in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2028 Convertible Notes) per 1,000 principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the conversion rate in effect on each such trading day; 
 if the Company calls any or all of the 2028 Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or 
 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. 
 On or after November 15, 2027 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2028 Convertible Notes, in multiples of 1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder regardless of the foregoing circumstances. 
 Upon conversion, the 2028 Convertible Notes will be settled in cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes to be converted, and in cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company s option, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes being converted. If the Company undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2028 Convertible Notes), subject to certain conditions, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2028 Convertible Notes, in principal amounts of 1,000 or a multiple thereof, at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, following certain corporate events or if the Company issues a notice of redemption, it will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for holders who elect to convert their 2028 Convertible Note in connection with such corporate event or during the relevant redemption period. 
 As of September 27, 2024, the conditions allowing holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes to convert had been met and, therefore, the 2028 Convertible Notes became eligible for conversion at the option of the holders beginning on July 1, 2024 and ending at the close of business on September 30, 2024. Subsequent to September 27, 2024, the sale price for conversion was satisfied as of September 30, 2024 and as a result, the Convertible Notes will continue to be eligible for optional conversion during the fourth quarter of 2024. Any determination regarding the convertibility of the 2028 Convertible Notes during future periods will be made in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 2028 Convertible Notes. If a conversion request occurs, the Company has the intent and ability to refinance the amounts that may become due with respect to the 2028 Convertible Notes using the available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. As such, the obligations associated with the 2028 Convertible Notes continue to be classified as a long-term liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 27, 2024. 
 The 2028 Convertible Notes are accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. The discount and issuance costs related to the 2028 Convertible Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of the 2028 Convertible Notes at an effective interest rate of . 
 Capped Call Transactions 
 In connection with the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the Capped Calls with certain financial institutions. The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company s common stock in connection with any conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2028 Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the strike price of written warrants. The initial upper strike price of the Capped Calls is per share and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Calls.

 Provision for income taxes Effective tax rate 
 The difference between the Company s effective tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 is due principally to the net impact of the Company s earnings outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates that differ from the U.S. federal rate, the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income GILTI tax, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income FDII deduction, the availability of tax credits and the recognition of certain discrete tax items.

million and a discrete tax benefit of million, respectively. The discrete tax benefits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 are predominately related to favorable return to provision adjustments attributable to the 2023 U.S. tax return. The remainder of the discrete tax amounts relate predominately to excess tax benefits, net of deductibility limitations, recognized upon vesting of RSUs, partially offset by tax expense from shortfalls recorded for the forfeiture of certain PRSUs, as well as unfavorable return to provision adjustments attributable to certain foreign tax returns for the 2023 tax year. 
 For the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, the Company recorded discrete tax benefits of million and million, respectively. The discrete tax expense for the third quarter and the nine months of 2023 predominately related to favorable return to provision adjustments attributable to the 2022 U.S. tax return. The remainder of the discrete tax amounts relate predominately to excess tax benefits recognized upon vesting of RSUs during those periods partially offset by tax expense from shortfalls recorded for the forfeiture of certain PRSUs, as well as unfavorable return to provision adjustments attributable to certain foreign tax returns for the 2022 tax year. 
 On December 15, 2022, the European Union EU Member States formally adopted the EU s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15 , as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD Pillar Two Framework. The effective dates are January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. A significant number of other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation with varying effective dates in the future. The Company is continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two Framework, pending legislative adoption by additional individual countries. The Company s 2024 provision for income taxes includes the impact of the Pillar Two 15 Global Minimum Tax, with an enactment date of January 1, 2024. 
 Unrecognized tax benefits reflect the difference between positions taken or expected to be taken on income tax returns and the amounts reflected in the financial statements. As of September 27, 2024, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million, substantially all of which would favorably impact the effective tax rate, net of federal benefit on state issues, if recognized. As of September 27, 2024, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that a reduction of approximately million of the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months as a result of various statute expirations, audit closures, and/or tax settlements.

 The dilutive effect for the Company's 2028 Convertible Notes is calculated using the if-converted method. The Company is required, pursuant to the indenture governing the 2028 Convertible Notes, to settle the principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes in cash and may elect to settle the remaining conversion obligation the in-the-money portion in cash, shares of the Company's common stock, or a combination thereof. Because the principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes must be settled in cash, the dilutive impact of applying the if-converted method is limited to the in-the-money portion, if any, of the 2028 Convertible Notes . During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 , the potential conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes was not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because the conversion feature in the 2028 Convertible Notes was out of the money and all associated shares were antidilutive.

 The Company also has foreign currency exposure on balances, primarily intercompany, that are denominated in a foreign currency and are adjusted to current values using period-end exchange rates. To minimize foreign currency exposure, the Company enters into foreign currency contracts with a one month maturity.

 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 Fair value standards also apply to certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. 
 Borrowings under the Company s Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility accrue interest at a floating rate tied to a standard short-term borrowing index, selected at the Company s option, plus an applicable margin. The carrying amount of this floating rate debt approximates fair value based upon the respective interest rates adjusting with market rate adjustments. 
 As of September 27, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the 2028 Convertible Notes was approximately million and million, respectively. The estimated fair value of the 2028 Convertible Notes was determined through consideration of quoted market prices. The fair value of the 2028 Convertible Notes is categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

 During the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, the Company determined that certain of it investments in its non-marketable equity securities were impaired and determined the fair value to be zero based upon available information. During the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, we recorded impairment charges of million and million, respectively. These assessments were based on qualitative indications of impairment which are considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement, as the fair value was determined based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Factors that significantly influenced the determination of the impairment losses included the investee s financial condition, operational and financing cash flow activities, and priority claims to the equity security, distributions rights and preferences. 
 The Company s equity method investment is in a venture capital fund focused on investing in life sciences companies. As of September 27, 2024, the Company owned of this fund.

 Impact of Global Events 
 Global economic challenges, including the impact of military conflicts, severe and sustained inflation, fluctuations in global currencies, and supply chain disruptions may continue to cause economic uncertainty and volatility. The impact of these issues on our business will vary by geographic market and product line, but specific impacts to our business include increased borrowing costs, labor shortages, disruptions in the supply chain, delayed or reduced customer orders and sales, and delays in shipments to and from certain countries. We monitor economic conditions closely. In response to potential reductions in revenue, we can take actions to align our cost structure with changes in demand and manage our working capital. However, there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of our efforts to mitigate any impact of the current and future adverse economic conditions and other developments. 
 Business Acquisitions 
 On January 5, 2024, we acquired 100 of the outstanding capital stock of Pulse Technologies, Inc. Pulse ), a technology, engineering and contract manufacturing company focused on complex micro machining of medical device components for high growth structural heart, heart pump, electrophysiology, leadless pacing, and neuromodulation markets. Pulse also provides proprietary advanced technologies, including hierarchical surface restructuring (HSR TM ), scratch-free surface finishes, and titanium nitride coatings. Consistent with our tuck-in acquisition strategy, the acquisition of Pulse further increases our end-to-end development capabilities and manufacturing footprint in targeted growth markets and provides customers with expanded capabilities, capacity and resources to accelerate the time to market for customer products. 
 Effective as of October 1, 2023, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of InNeuroCo, Inc. InNeuroCo ), a recognized leader in neurovascular catheter innovation with strong development and manufacturing capabilities. InNeuroCo s expertise and highly differentiated neurovascular catheter innovation complements our existing capabilities and market focus. Consistent with our acquisition strategy, the acquisition of InNeuroCo further increases our ability to provide enhanced solutions to our customers in the neurovascular catheter space.

 Financial Overview 
 Income from continuing operations for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 36.3 million, or 1.01 per diluted share, and 88.1 million, or 2.49 per diluted share, respectively, compared to 28.2 million, or 0.83 per diluted share, and 62.3 million, or 1.85 per diluted share for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. These variances are primarily the result of the following: 
 Sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased 34.6 million and 115.9 million, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by strong demand, new product ramps, growth from emerging customers with PMA (premarket approval) products and contributions from our recent acquisitions. 
 Gross profit for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased 11.6 million and 41.9 million, respectively, primarily from higher sales volume leverage, efficiencies gained from the continued improvement in the supply chain and contributions from our recent acquisitions. 
 Operating expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased 2.3 million and 10.5 million, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, due to higher SG A and Restructuring and other charges, partially offset by lower RD E costs. 
 Interest expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased 3.1 million and 3.9 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher average debt outstanding, partially offset by a decrease in losses from extinguishment of debt. 
 During the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, we recognized gains on equity investments of 0.9 million and 2.0 million, respectively, compared to losses of 3.5 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. Gains and losses on equity investments are generally unpredictable in nature. 
 Other loss, net for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were net losses of 0.9 million and 1.8 million, respectively, compared to net losses of 0.6 million and 1.7 million, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency gains and losses in the respective periods. 
 We recorded provisions for income taxes for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 of 7.1 million and 20.2 million, respectively, compared with provisions for income taxes of 5.1 million and 13.1 million, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. The changes in income tax expense were primarily due to relative changes in pre-tax income and the impact of discrete tax items.

 Product Line Sales 
 For the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, Cardio Vascular C V sales increased 27.0 million, or 13 , and 80.6 million, or 13 , respectively, versus the comparable 2023 periods. The increase in C V sales was driven by new product ramps in electrophysiology and structural heart, and the InNeuroCo and Pulse acquisitions. C V sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 included 13.5 million and 40.3 million, respectively, of sales from the recent Pulse and InNeuroCo acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on C V sales during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 in comparison to 2023. 
 For the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, Cardiac Rhythm Management Neuromodulation CRM N sales increased 5.0 million, or 3 , and 30.4 million, or 7 , respectively, versus the comparable 2023 periods, driven by strong growth in emerging neuromodulation customers with PMA (premarket approval) products, and the Pulse acquisition. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on CRM N sales during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 in comparison to 2023. 
 Advanced Surgical, Orthopedic Portable Medical AS O sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased 2.6 million, or 12 , and 4.9 million, or 6 , respectively, versus the comparable 2023 periods, primarily driven by fulfillment timing of last-time-buy orders related to the planned multi-year Portable Medical exit announced in 2022. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on AS O sales during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 in comparison to the 2023 periods.

 __________ 
 (a) Compensation and benefits increased primarily due to annual merit increases and an increase in headcount related to the recent Pulse and InNeuroCo acquisitions. 
 (b) The changes in depreciation and amortization expense for the three and nine month periods were due to the mix and timing of depreciation and amortization of certain property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. 
 (c) Professional fees increased primarily due to higher legal expense related to general corporate matters. 
 (d) Contract services expense increased primarily due to higher software costs from information technology enhancements. 
 (e) The increase in bank fees and charges during the first nine months of 2024 was driven by increased accounts receivable factoring and supplier financing fees primarily due to the launch of accounts receivable factoring arrangements during 2023. 
 
 RD E 
 RD E expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 11.9 million and 42.8 million, respectively, compared to 14.1 million and 48.9 million, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. The decreases in RD E expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 were primarily due to lower labor costs and the timing of program milestone achievements for customer funded programs. RD E expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. Our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations.

 Restructuring and Other Charges 
 We continuously evaluate our business and identify opportunities to realign resources to better serve our customers and markets, improve operational efficiency and capabilities, and lower operating costs. To realize the benefits associated with these opportunities, we undertake restructuring-type activities to transform our business. We incur costs associated with these activities, which primarily include exit and disposal costs and other costs directly related to the restructuring initiative. Restructuring charges include exit and disposal costs from these activities. In addition, from time to time, we incur costs associated with acquiring and integrating businesses, and certain other general expenses, including asset impairments. 
 Restructuring and other charges comprise the following (in thousands):

 During 2024, contractual interest expense has increased due to higher average debt balance outstanding. The higher average debt balance outstanding is primarily the result of borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility to fund the Pulse and InNeuroCo acquisitions. 
 Other components of interest expense on borrowings include gains on an interest rate swap contract and non-cash amortization and write-off (losses from extinguishment of debt) of deferred debt issuance costs and original issue discount. Gain on interest rate swap includes realized gains on an interest rate swap contract which matured as of June 30, 2023. Amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and original issue discount increased during 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 as a result of higher unamortized balances related to new debt. The losses from extinguishment of debt during the first nine months of 2023 were related to prepayments of portions of the TLA Facility and full repayment of our seven-year term B loan (the TLB Facility in connection with issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes. 
 As of September 27, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 46 and 51 , respectively, of our principal amount of debt are fixed rate borrowings.

 Equity method investment (gain) loss for both periods in 2024 and 2023 relates to our share of equity method investee (gains) losses including unrealized appreciation/depreciation of the underlying interests of the investee. As of September 27, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our equity method investment was 10.1 million and 7.8 million, respectively. 
 During the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, we determined that, based upon available information, certain of our investments in non-marketable equity securities were impaired and determined the fair value to be zero. As a result, during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 we recorded impairment charges of 0.3 million and 3.3 million, respectively. As of September 27, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was 0.2 million and 0.4 million, respectively. 
 See Note 14, Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for further details regarding these investments. 
 
 Other Loss, Net 
 Other loss, net for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were net losses of 0.9 million and 1.8 million, respectively, compared to net losses of 0.6 million and 1.7 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Other loss, net primarily includes gains/losses from the impact of exchange rates on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency transaction gains/losses are based primarily on fluctuations of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, Mexican peso, Uruguayan peso, Malaysian ringgits or Dominican peso. 
 The impact of exchange rates on transactions denominated in foreign currencies included in Other loss, net for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were net losses of 0.8 million and 1.7 million, respectively, compared to losses of 0.5 million and 1.7 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. We continually monitor our foreign currency exposures and seek to take steps to mitigate these risks. However, fluctuations in exchange rates could have a significant impact, positive or negative, on our financial results in the future.

 Provision for Income Taxes 
 We recognized income tax expense of 7.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 on 43.4 million of income before taxes (effective tax rate of 16.4 ), compared to an income tax expense of 5.1 million on 33.3 million of income before taxes (effective tax rate of 15.3 for the same period of 2023. The income tax expense for the first nine months of 2024 was 20.2 million on 108.3 million of income before taxes (effective tax rate of 18.7 ), compared to income tax expense of 13.1 million on income before taxes of 75.4 million (effective tax rate of 17.3 for the same period of 2023. Income tax expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 included discrete benefits of 1.6 million and 1.9 million, respectively. For the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, we recorded discrete tax expense of 0.8 million and 0.4 million, respectively. 
 Our effective tax rate for 2024 differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 due principally to the estimated impact of Federal Tax Credits (including R D credits and Foreign tax credits), stock-based compensation windfalls or shortfalls, and the impact of U.S taxes on foreign earnings, including the GILTI provision which requires us to include foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of a deemed return on a foreign subsidiary s tangible assets in our U.S. income tax return. The U.S. tax on foreign earnings is reflected net of a statutory deduction of 50 of the GILTI inclusion (subject to limitations based on U.S. taxable income, if any) and net of FDII that provides a 37.5 deduction to domestic companies for certain foreign sales and services income. In addition, our rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory rates that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. The primary foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the statutory tax rate for each respective jurisdiction include Switzerland (22 ), Mexico (30 ), Uruguay (25 ), Ireland (12.5 and Malaysia (24 ). We previously operated under a tax holiday in Malaysia. We met the conditions of the Malaysian tax holiday and the holiday expired in accordance with its original terms on April 30, 2023. Our manufacturing operations in the Dominican Republic operate under a free trade zone agreement through March 2034. 
 On December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15 , as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework. The effective dates are January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. A significant number of other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation with varying effective dates in the future. We continue to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two Framework, pending legislative adoption by additional individual countries. Our 2024 provision for income taxes includes the impact of the Pillar Two 15 Global Minimum Tax, with an enactment date of January 1, 2024. 
 There is a potential for volatility of our effective tax rate due to several factors, including changes in the mix of pre-tax income and the jurisdictions to which it relates, business acquisitions, settlements with taxing authorities, changes in tax rates, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We continue to closely monitor developments related to proposed changes in tax laws and tax rates. In addition, we continue to explore planning opportunities that may have a material impact on our effective tax rate. 
 
 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 
 For the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, we recognized losses from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, of 0.8 million and 0.9 million, respectively, compared to a loss of 0.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 and income of 2.0 million for the first nine months of 2023. Discontinued operations consists of the results of operations of the Electrochem business, the sale of which is expected to be completed by the end of October 2024.

 457,727 382,497 Current ratio from continuing operations (a) 
 3.11 2.76 
 __________ 
 (a) Excludes current assets and liabilities held for sale at September 27, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Cash and cash equivalents at September 27, 2024 increased by 11.9 million from December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of cash generated by operating activities and net borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility, mostly offset by purchases of property, plant and equipment and cash paid to acquire Pulse. 
 Working capital from continuing operations increased by 75.2 million from December 31, 2023, or 63.3 million excluding the increase in cash and cash equivalents. The increase in working capital, exclusive of cash and cash equivalents, primarily relates to positive fluctuations in accounts receivable, inventory and contract assets. Inventory increased from higher sales volume and product demand which also contributed to the increase in contract assets and accounts receivable. 
 At September 27, 2024, 21.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. We intend to limit our distributions from foreign subsidiaries to previously taxed income or current period earnings. If distributions are made utilizing current period earnings, we will record foreign withholding taxes in the period of the distribution. 
 As of September 27, 2024, our capital structure consisted of 1.079 billion of debt, net of deferred debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts and 34 million shares of common stock outstanding. As of September 27, 2024, we had access to 580.5 million of borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, available for normal course of business and letters of credit, and are authorized to issue up to 100 million shares of common stock and 100 million shares of preferred stock. As of September 27, 2024, our contractual debt service obligations for the next twelve months, consisting of principal and interest on our outstanding debt, are estimated to be approximately 54 million. Actual principal and interest payments may be higher if, for instance, the applicable interest rates on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities increase, we borrow additional amounts on our Revolving Credit Facility, or we pay principal amounts in excess of the required minimums reflected in the contractual debt service obligations above. 
 Based on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows provided by operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are sufficient to meet our working capital, debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. If our future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing. We continually evaluate and consider various financing alternatives to enhance or supplement our existing financial resources. However, we cannot be assured that we will be able to enter into any such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all. 
 Credit Facilities and 2028 Convertible Notes 
 As of September 27, 2024, we had Senior Secured Credit Facilities that consist of an 800 million Revolving Credit Facility, with an outstanding principal balance of 216 million, and a TLA Facility with an outstanding principal balance of 375 million. The Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility mature on February 15 , 2028 . The Senior Secured Credit Facilities include a mandatory prepayment provision customary for similar credit facilities. 
 During the first quarter of 2023, we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes, which mature on February 15, 2028 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.125 per annum. The total net proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes, after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and debt issuance costs, were approximately 485 million. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes to settle in full principal and interest due of 336.1 million under the TLB Facility, pay down principal and interest due of 113.9 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, to pay related fees and expenses, and to pay the cost of the capped calls related to the issuance of our 2028 Convertible Notes.

 INTEGER HOLDINGS CORPORATION 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 As of September 27, 2024, the conditions allowing holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes to convert had been met and, therefore, the 2028 Convertible Notes became eligible for conversion at the option of the holders beginning on July 1, 2024 and ending at the close of business on September 30, 2024. Subsequent to September 27, 2024, the sale price for conversion was satisfied as of September 30, 2024 and as a result, the Convertible Notes will continue to be eligible for optional conversion during the fourth quarter of 2024. Any determination regarding the convertibility of the 2028 Convertible Notes during future periods will be made in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 2028 Convertible Notes. If a conversion request occurs, we have the intent and ability to refinance the amounts that may become due with respect to the 2028 Convertible Notes using the available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. As such, these obligations with respect to the 2028 Convertible Notes continue to be classified as a long-term liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 27, 2024. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility contain covenants requiring that we maintain (i) a Total Net Leverage Ratio not to exceed 5.00:1.00, subject to increase in certain circumstances following certain qualified acquisitions and (ii) an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.50:1.00. As of September 27, 2024, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. As of September 27, 2024, our Total Net Leverage Ratio, calculated in accordance with our Senior Secured Credit Facilities agreement, was approximately 2.6:1.0. For the twelve month period ended September 27, 2024, our interest coverage ratio, calculated in accordance with our Senior Secured Credit Facilities agreement, was approximately 7.8:1.0. 
 Failure to comply with these financial covenants would result in an event of default as defined under the Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility unless waived by the lenders. An event of default may result in the acceleration of our indebtedness. As a result, management believes that compliance with these covenants is material to us. 
 See Note 7, Debt of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for a further information on the Company s outstanding debt. 
 Factoring Arrangements 
 We utilize accounts receivable factoring arrangements with financial institutions to accelerate the timing of cash receipts and enhance our cash position. These arrangements, in all cases, do not contain recourse provisions, which would obligate us in the event of our customers failure to pay. During the first nine months of 2024, we sold, without recourse, 162.6 million of accounts receivable. We did not utilize receivable factoring arrangements prior to the second quarter of 2023. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for further information regarding our factoring arrangements. 
 Summary of Cash Flow 
 The following cash flow summary information includes cash flows related to discontinued operations. Nine Months Ended (in thousands) September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 141,974 124,626 Investing activities (225,031) (82,785) Financing activities 95,625 (35,537) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (668) 1,566 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 11,900 7,870 
 Operating Activities During the first nine months of 2024, we generated cash from operations of 142.0 million, compared to 124.6 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase of 17.3 million was the result of a 29.4 million increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a 12.1 million decrease in cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
 The increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization was primarily from higher sales volume and margin partially offset by higher acquisition costs due to the Pulse acquisition. The decrease associated with changes in operating assets and liabilities is primarily related to unfavorable cash flow impacts from accrued expenses. Accrued expenses included higher levels of profit sharing and bonus payments in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Investing Activities The 142.2 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to cash paid for an acquisition and increased purchases of property, plant and equipment. Investing activities for the first nine months of 2024 included net cash paid of 138.5 million for the Pulse acquisition.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the first nine months of 2024 was 95.6 million compared to 35.5 million used in financing activities for the first nine months of 2023. Cash provided by financing activities for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to net borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility of 117.0 million, primarily to fund the Pulse acquisition. The cash used in financing activities for the first nine months of 2023 was primarily related to the issuance of our 2028 Convertible Notes of 486.3 million, which was partially offset by 335.6 million in full repayment of our TLB Facility, 55.3 million in repayments on our TLA Facility, 59.4 million of net payments on our Revolving Credit Facility and 35.0 million of capped call purchases related to the issuance of our 2028 Convertible Notes. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not currently have off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 In the normal course of business, we evaluate all new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, SEC, or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report for additional information about these recently issued accounting standards and their potential impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Making estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Management believes the estimates, assumptions and judgments employed and resulting balances reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ materially. 
 There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those disclosed in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
