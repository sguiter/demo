PART

 FINANCIAL
INFORMATION 

Important
Notice: Deficient Report 

The
financial statements that form part of the present Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period covering the third quarter of 2024 (the
 2024 10-Q have not been reviewed by a registered public accounting firm. This filing must therefore be considered as substantially
deficient. On May 3, 2024, the Company was made aware that its auditor, BF Borgers CPA PC, had been denied the privilege of appearing
or practicing before the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC as an accountant. The Company has appointed a new
registered public accounting firm: Fruci Associates II PLLC, Certified Public Accountants based in Spokane, Washington Fruci
 Associates to replace BF Borgers. However, due to a vastly increased workload as well as the necessity of reauditing the
2023 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K (the 2023 10-K ), Fruci Associates has been unable to complete the review of
either the present 2024 10-Q or the previous 10-Q filed for the first and second quarters of 2024 on July 15, 2024 and August 19, 2024
respectively, as required. The present deficiency is entirely due to circumstances beyond the control of the Company. 

The
Company has been working diligently with Fruci Associates to complete first 2023 10-K reaudit and has received initial notice that
the audit is nearing completion. In connection with this review, the Company has been put on notice by the Auditor that they are reviewing
the amortization policy used by the Company to date on its Intangible Asset. Company management considers this asset to be intangible
and indefinite since the value of the intellectual property is not based on a patent with a finite life but rather on the technical knowhow
supported by certain patents, moreover, the fundamental basis for the Company s extraction technology is based on a radically different
technology that has applications in many areas providing at present an undefined number of application fields and giving rise, potentially,
to a number of specific patents in each of these fields as the general principal is adapted for specific use. As a result, the Company
has not seen fit to consider the technology to have a finite value at the present time. Reference is made to the section relating to
the evaluation of the technology below. In the event that the Auditor takes a different view of the value of the technology, it is unlikely
that Management would oppose this view, and in the worst case, this may lead to a restatement of the value of the technology by reapplying
amortization that was originally suspended on September 30, 2021. The result of this may lead to a serious reduction in the balance sheet
value of the technology. 

Notwithstanding
the above possible restatement of the value of the technology of the Company due to the application of amortization, the Company has
no reason to believe that either this present 2024 10-Q or any of the previously issued financial statements cannot be relied upon because
of an error in the statements. The Company has appointed and continues to work with Fruci Associates to carry out the audit and
reviews and will make every effort to support Fruci Associates in reauditing the 2023 10-K and refiling the previous 10-Q filing
for the first quarter of 2024 and this present 2024 10-Q for the second quarter following the required reviews as soon as possible.

 September

 not
reviewed 

The
Company will run the first extraction tests on brine solutions mixed with controlled defined quantities of single elements followed by
controlled mixtures that will approximate the naturally occurring brines of potential customers. The Company has already received small
brine samples from Clontarf Energy plc Clontarf ), a UK AIM listed company with whom the Company concluded an agreement
for iTDE Technology in Bolivia through a jointly established commercial venture. The composition of these brines will be the basis for
modeling these controlled samples. This initial calibration of the system will be done by making synthetic brines based upon analytical
data received from the Bolivian State Lithium Company and should provide a basis for better testing with actual brines. We expect large
container sized samples of actual brines to arrive in India in or about January of 2025 for testing in our pilot plant system. 

The
Company continues to work with it Indian partners to test the effectiveness of proprietary nano-filtration system to use in front of
our pilot plant system to remove significant amounts of divalent ions, such as magnesium and calcium, without the use of any chemicals.
This may make our complete system more economical in challenging remote areas such as our project with Clontarf in Bolivia. 

The
Company has committed to establishing a small office in India as a permanent base in which to continue its system development and better
to manage work with its Indian partners. 

Due
to a lack of funding, the Company has scaled back its intellectual property protection strategy in the near term. 

as of September 30,
2024. Until such time as the pilot plant is completed and the Company can commence the normal commercialization of its technology, further
losses are anticipated. Management anticipates more losses before the commercialization of the system can be expected to break-even or
to turn a profit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company showed a net loss of as compared with the loss
of for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash used in operating activities of the Company during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was and , respectively. Notwithstanding the receipt of the first income
from the commencement of the commercialization of the Company s main asset, its iTDE Technology, there remains a substantial doubt
regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management believes that the Company s capital requirements
will depend on many factors including the continuing and expanding success of the Company s development efforts. Notwithstanding
the promising results of the Company s participation in its venture with Clontarf and the Government of Bolivia, the Company will
require additional capital to reach its goals. 

From
the anticipated receipts of any financing, the Company must discharge outstanding payables of and a further in accrued
expenses. These figures do not include a total of payable for salary, remuneration and expenses that has been deferred by
agreement until the Company is profitable. 

Provided
that the agreements with employees and consultants on the deferral of their outstanding remuneration take effect and the shareholders
convert their loans into equity, the Company will need to raise an estimated million to manage its business needs and expansion. There
is no assurance that the financing of this nature will be available. The inability to raise the financing necessary and the general business
uncertainties and particular conditions and situations described above raise doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and or obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.
Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors and, or the
private placement of common stock. There can be no assurances that management s plans will be successful. 

(see Note
5 to these unaudited condensed financial statements and disclosure in the preamble to the present 2024 10-Q). The Company conducts regular
assessments of the iTDE Technology to identify if its value is impaired in any way, (i) on an annual basis and (ii) if, in the opinion
of Management, there exists any external or internal reason why the asset might be impaired. In the opinion of management, as at the
date of this report, there exists no external or internal reason why the asset might be impaired. 

as of September 30, 2024, it was increased from the reported as of December
31, 2023. This represents an increase of during the period. Prepaid expenses comprise a deposit on the rental of laboratory
facilities and a deposit under a consultancy agreement, both unchanged. The remainder comprises advance payments for the purpose
of filing for intellectual property protection. Payments are made in trust to our IP attorneys through whom amounts are disbursed when
required. The trust account is replenished when needed. Finally, the Company loaned a total amount of to a US engineering and
materials research corporation under a program controlled by the CEO of the Company that is expected to be repaid by May 30, 2025, together
with interest of per annum.

the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced in this and previous filings. 

Given
these uncertainties, readers of this Form 10-Q and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
The Company disclaims any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking
statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments. 

Overview 

The
Company was organized on August 13, 2014, as a Nevada corporation under Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. The Company s
registered address is 3773 Howard Hughes Pkwy STE 500S, Las Vegas, NV, 89169, USA, and its principal office is located at 1980 Festival
Plaza Drive, Summerlin South, 300, Las Vegas, NV 89135. 

The
Company qualifies as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act which became law
in April 2012. The definition of an emerging growth company is a company with an initial public offering of common equity
securities which occurred after December 8, 2011, and has less than 1 billion of total annual gross revenues during last completed fiscal
year. 

Overview
of the Business 

Since
April 27, 2021, the Company has changed its business entirely with the acquisition of intellectual property assets related to a novel
membrane-based ion extraction process iTDE Technology ), which is able to extract ions exiting in low concentrations from
liquid solutions. The iTDE Technology is now being used in laboratory pilot testing to enable the Company to produce its first commercial
prototypes using the novel the Extraction method. The iTDE Technology allows for the removal of ions from solution: without concentration
by evaporation (significantly preserving the water resources); without pressure or additional heating (reducing energy costs); and targets
the specific ions to be extracted (reducing the need for further operations and increasing the potential for the sale of other ions present
in the solution). Because of the reduced interference with the environment, the lower energy costs, and the lack of a need for large
evaporation ponds, management considers the iTDE Technology to be more environmentally friendly and sustainable when compared to alternatives. 

The
iTDE Technology has been shown effective when extracting lithium from brine solutions or mine leach solutions, and to have significant
potential in the following applications: extracting fatty acids from vegetable oils as a superior refining process; extracting glycerides
from biodiesel as a superior purification process; extracting radioactive ions from nuclear waste waters; extracting specific metal ions
from mine leach solutions and waste effluents; and to remove salts from seawater for desalination, among other things. 

Currently,
the primary focus of the business is on completion of the first of two pilot plants embodying the iTDE Technology system that will enable
the demonstration of the extraction system for the extraction of lithium, calcium, magnesium, boron, and certain other elements. The
first system will provide greater flexibility to optimize and extend the reach of the process, allowing for replacement of sensor systems
and variation of process parameters. It is anticipated that this pilot plant will not only demonstrate the system and its ability to
target lithium using naturally occurring brines and liquors (solutions of crushed ores), but also provide a platform to optimize the
extraction process and extend the extraction to other elements. The first pilot plant will enable the Company to establish the percentage
level of extraction including the purity of the extracted elements and the chemical form of the extracted elements. This will give a
clear indication of the economics of the process. 

A
second pilot plant system is planned that will draw on the experience gained from operation of the first pilot plant to improve the current
design enabling higher throughputs and a better processing ability for marketing purposes. 

3 

The
Company believes it has the ability of the system to scale up due to its modular configuration: adding more units increases the extraction
potential. It is anticipated following successful completion and trial and calibration of the iTDE System pilot plant, the Company will
launch the commercial testing and deployment of its system that will enable the commercial deployment of the system.

Annual
expenses as of the third quarter of 2024 were 1,219,391 as compared to 1,778,554 to the third quarter of 2023 a reduction of 559,163. 

The
primary reasons for the variation were, first, the exchange of shares conducted under the agreement signed with Clontarf Energy Limited Clontarf that governs the introduction of the Company s technology into the Bolivian market and second a general
reduction in all expenses compared to the previous period. 

Under
the Clontarf agreement, the Company was obliged to transfer to Clontarf shares of its common stock to the value of 500,000 and this
resulted in an expense of 500,000. As part of the mutual obligations under the said agreement, the Company received from Clontarf shares
with a value of 203,050 recorded in Other Income. 

During
the nine months ending September 30, 2024, the Company invested a total of 496,025 in to a company involved in certain R D and investments
designed to benefit and assist the Company. During the same period, the Company increased its investment into this Company by 48,100
and booked interest income of 72,826 from loans made this third party company. 

The
expense of contractors increased by 136,570 as a result of the need to hire back the services of an employee that left the Company in
January 2024. This was considered necessary because of the need to reaudit the Company s financial statements and other ongoing
required work. 

As
of the third quarter of 2024, the Company booked interest expense of 41,359 on the indebtedness of long-standing unpaid salaries to
senior employees leading to an increase in employee benefits. 

There
was a decrease in all other expenses during the nine-month period to September 30, 2024 by 421,163 compared to the previous period. 

To
fund the Company s operations, the Company contracted new loans and extended loans falling due which resulted in an increase of
 68,408 in loan interest recorded over the same period in 2023. All interest under these shareholder loans is due at the end of the loan
period on the settlement date. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had total current assets of 694,685 and an accumulated deficit of 7,273,354. 

Our
operating activities used 1,033,072 in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while our operations used 366,458 cash
in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating activities included loans to a third party company amounting to 496,025
expected to be returned with interest during second quarter 2025. During this period, the Company has focused attention on the work
necessary to complete the pilot plants. Strategically it was considered necessary to complete the pilot plants to enable the Company
to move to the next stage of its marketing plan: to demonstrate the system and its extraction economics to potential users. The
Company currently has several companies interested in evaluating the system using their brines and these tests will consume a
considerable amount of time once the pilot plants are ready to process. Management considers it preferable to focus on this work,
and this has led to an overall reduction in expenses prior to reengaging in other activities. 

4 

Our
cash requirements continue to be primarily for the manufacture of the iTDE System pilot plant with the purchase of equipment, materials
and operating expenses for the development of pilot plant systems, payroll, intellectual and other expenses. During fiscal 2024 the Company
plans to open new corporate offices and commence the organization of its initial production facility based on the results of the Pilot
Plant trials. 

Historically
we have depended on investment from our principal shareholders and their affiliated companies to provide us with working capital as required
as well as the forbearance of our employees and consultants to forgo all or part of their contracted salaries. There is no guarantee
that such funding or other sources of funding will be available when required and there can be no assurance that our stockholders and
employees, or any of them, will continue making loans or advances to us in the future. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to an investor in our securities. 

Seasonality 

Our
operating results are not affected by seasonality. 

Inflation 

The
Company has in the past used funding from debt convertible equity as its primary source of funding. In the event of a high inflationary
environment, this method of funding may become more expensive and may be less readily available. Our core business and operating results
are not affected in any material way by inflation. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements
requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and
expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare financial statements. The estimates are based
on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results
could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and assumptions
and are critical to our results of operations and financial position. Our critical accounting estimates are discussed in Note 2 to our
unaudited financial statements contained herein. 

Item
3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information
required by this Item.

Item
4 - Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
of Controls and Procedures 

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s
reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
including the Company s chief executive officer (who is the Company s principal executive officer) and the Company s
President (who is the Company s chief operating officer) as well as its Financial Officer (the Company s principal financial
officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. At present one person combines the roles of President and Chief
Financial Officer. In designing and evaluating the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the Company s management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives. The Company s management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
with possible controls and procedures. The ineffectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures was due to material
weaknesses identified in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, described below. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company s financial reporting. To evaluate the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management,
with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer has conducted an assessment,
including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO (2013). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. This assessment included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness
of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. 

Based
on this evaluation, the Company s management concluded its internal control over financial reporting, while significantly improved,
was still not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Principal
financial controls are managed by the Company s controller who maintains the accounts under the supervision of the Chief Financial
Officer. At present the Company still relies on advances by officers and employees using their own means of payment to fund the Company,
these are then repaid (or accumulated as debt) against an accounting of such expenses. The Company plans to issue its own means of payment
in the future that would improve efficiency and transparency. The Company changed its bankers during the course of the third quarter
2023. While we believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within any Company have been detected, the Company continues to improve its control environment with a view to establishing
an effective control environment and to satisfying the Company auditors of the same.

PART

 OTHER
INFORMATION 

Item
1 - Legal Proceedings 

On April 26, 2024, Judge Elizabeth Leonard of the
Midland County District Court in Midland, Texas entered a Third Turnover Order (the Turnover Order requiring the Company
to turn over 15,866,096 of its common shares, registered to a corporation with the same name as the Company (NEXT-ChemX Corporation) but
registered in a different jurisdiction. Although the several Turnover Orders provided for the transfer of shares to Sparkie Properties
L.L.C. Sparkie that is managed by Glenn A. Little, who was also appointed receiver of the privately held Texas corporation
that owned the shares in the Nevada public company. The Third Turnover Order provided that the shares be turned over to NEXT-ChemX
Corporation , a Texas corporation, Glenn A. Little, as Director and Receiver . 

This decree was issued, even though neither the privately
held shareholder in the Company with the same name of NEXT-ChemX Corporation but chartered in Texas, nor the Company itself was ever involved
in the underlying lawsuit giving rise to said decree. The order arose from litigation in Sparkie Properties L.L.C. v. NextMetals Limited
and Benton Wilcoxon , CV 58242, In the District Court of Midland County, Texas, 238 th Judicial District. The shares of the
Company owned by NEXT-ChemX Corporation, the privately held Texas corporation, were alleged, erroneously, to belong to NextMetals Limited,
a defendant in the litigation, rather than the actual equity owner of the shares, to wit, the aforementioned closely held private company. 

In fact, NextMetals Limited, a Gibraltar corporation
defendant in the litigation owns shares in the closely held private company, NEXT-ChemX Corporation. Irrespective of that fact, Judge
Leonard s erroneous order mandated the seizure and transfer of the private Texas Company s assets, which were shares in the
Nevada public company, and not the stock in the private Texas company, which shares the same name as the Nevada public corporation. 

The similarity of names between the Company and the
private Texas corporation came about in 2021. At that time, the Company changed its business model and adopted the name of its principal
shareholder that contributed the technology currently exploited by the Company. In exchange for an assignment of these novel and potentially
disruptive technologies, the private Texas entity was awarded a controlling number of shares. These material facts were ignored by the
Court. Moreover, when the private Texas Company whose assets were under threat of seizure and unquestioned transfer to the receiver, the
Texas company petitioned the Court to be heard. The trial court judge, contrary to standard practice and tradition in Texas courts, refused
to schedule a hearing to consider the merits of the Texas company s written briefs and motion for oral argument and proceeded to
enter a judgment, effectively depriving the private Texas company of its major asset. 

The aforementioned Turnover Order is not a final order.
It is the intention of management to appeal this erroneous ruling to the Texas Court of Appeals for the Eleventh District, located in
Eastland, Texas. A notice of appeal has already been filed and the issue will be contested in briefs submitted by the Company s
counsel in the early Fall of 2024. The filing of the appeal suspends enforcement of Judge Leonard s order until further action by
the appellate court. 

In addition, the Company has engaged an experienced
securities attorney to file a formal complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC in Washington,
D.C. with respect to Sparkie Properties L.L.C. s unlawful attempt to transfer the 15,866,096 common shares issued by the Company
belonging to the Texas chartered NEXT-ChemX Corporation. The Company s lawyer will seek the opening of an investigation from the
SEC s Enforcement Division into the transaction that led to the Turnover Order and a federal injunction from the U.S. District Court
for the District of Nevada freezing the shares covered by the Turnover Order until the Court determines the validity of the Third Turnover
Order. 

Simultaneously, the Company s Nevada counsel
intends to file a complaint in the U.S. District Court for Nevada (Las Vegas Division) seeking damages and an immediate recission of the
Turnover Order, alleging tortious interference with the right to contract, an unlawful taking of property without compensation, and material
violations of various federal and state securities laws. 

When the Company received notice from its transfer
agent, Empire Stock Transfer Inc. Empire of Henderson, Nevada that, irrespective of the ongoing appeal of the Turnover
Order and the fact that the shares covered by the Turnover Order were not the property of Sparkie Properties, L.L.C., Empire nevertheless
advised the Company that it intended to issue and transfer to the receiver the shares covered by the Turnover Order. The Company immediately
terminated Empire as its transfer agent. This was done via an email and letter delivered on May 23, 2024, in which Empire acknowledged
its receipt of the termination notice. 

Although Empire no longer represented NEXT-ChemX Corporation,
the Nevada public company, Empire promptly cancelled the shares owned by NEXT-ChemX Corporation, the closely held private corporation
and issued 15,866,096 common shares in the public company divided into two share certificates to NEXT-ChemX Corporation, a Texas corporation,
Glenn A. Little, as Director and Receiver. 

The Company and its attorneys believe
the Turnover Order is illegal for reasons stated in a brief timely filed by attorneys for Benton Wilcoxon and NextMetals Ltd with the
Texas Court of Appeals.
